My pleasure! I was never into Kpop until I saw RM's UN speech just recently. It led me to research about them, then I stumbled on your reddit post. It was (& still is) the most comprehensive background about BTS that I've read thus far. Again, THANK YOU!
writing my presentation about the globalisation of kpop isn’t going as planned i’m constantly distracted..currently watching bts‘ speech at the UN and i’m so proud
Egyptian schools teaching the new generations Namjoon's speech at the UN @BTS_twt #Loveyourself @_GenUnlimitedhttps://twitter.com/Bangtan_Egypt/status/1199401445239541766 …
A school made a seminar about bullying and guess what?? They used the BTS UN speech for more explanation Proud of my boys @BTS_twt #BTSLoveMyself #ENDviolencepic.twitter.com/B7gtY30Nys
Yes we stan bts, Princes of pop, academy members, best debut artists of the decade who broke the record of Beatles for having three albums #1 on bb in a year, with 3 tsa, 1 top grp bbmas, 4+ millions sales for persona alone and the only korean artists to give speech in UN
I watched the UN speech last night & it was so powerful!
Welcome Sir! Their Twitter account is @BTS_twt. I'm an older fan as well. I was very impressed by RM's UN speech. Have you seen that? I figured, if such an intelligent young man is writing their lyrics, they must be really good. I wasn't disappointed!
okay last talk , watch their UN speech or any speech that they gave at awards event then u can finally get it why we love them. peace, no war sincerely from army since bts debut
everytime i watch joons UN speech it brings me to tears and it’s so empowering and i love him and i love bts they’ve really helped me and i’m so immensely grateful i found them
@BTS_twt leader #RM gave inspiring speech about self-love self-acceptance at UN #ENDviolence session as part of launch of @_GenUnlimited New @UNICEF agenda for youth. Let's take few minutes listen. Learned #LoveYourself now let's go forth & #SpeakYourselfpic.twitter.com/NHt9WlH3vU
ALSO UN SPEECH BITCHSHS I CANT CRAM IT DOWN TO 4 BTS TOO TALENTED
Found a playlist on Apple music...liked them but didn't become a fan until September 2018 when I saw the UN speech. I had been a low-key fan of K-pop (mostly through K-Dramas) but not ARMY till that speech. I brought me from the edge of doing something stupid. Now I'm a hard stan
award shows didnt care about having a kpop group on their show until bts showed tf up, the UN didnt expect to have a kpop group give a speech until they learned bts’ message, yall didnt care about where ur favs performed for concerts till yall saw bts performing at big venues
SHUTUP MY BEST FRIEND WHOS A LOCAL BUT LOVES MY LOVE FOR BTS JUST RANDOMLY WATCHED THEIR UN SPEECH AND SAID SHE LOVED IT pic.twitter.com/KwVVxkXbEM
Maybe look a little into BTS. Notice their concepts; how they connect literature and psychology to them.Look at their UNICEF campaign & Love Yourself. Listen to the speech at the UN. Notice the struggles they've overcome. Meet them before you HATE. That's all. @BTSx50States
So many nice and lovely people here!! I'm 41, single mother of twins, I don't have bias, bc I can't choose! But sometimes I like to watch RM during the one and only speech at UN, just to feel motivated and don't forget to love myself! Nice to meet you all!
best to get it out of his system cuz I’m really looking forward to seeing him and I don’t want any sad faces. I haven’t seen him since May when I stayed with him for the BTS concert. He sat that night with me and binge watched BTS vids with me & watched the UN speech. He supports
Sooo did anyone else see BlackPink’s speech at the UN? Yeah,neither did I.... Soooooo... People’s Choice? My ... (fill in the blanks) ... so proud of a real ACCOMPLISHMENT
Okay okay okay, soy yo o el speech de Halsey fue un shoutout a los pcas?????????? #AmericasBestGroupBTS #AMAs2019 @BTS_twt
The fact that Namjoon's UN speech was taught in some schools. @BTS_twt
Because it's true. We all make mistakes. I have had my moments/times that I wish to erase. But without them we wouldn't be who we are today. Best reference point for me is always RMs UN speech 2018 Happy to have met you, too You're so lovely!
Joon’s UN speech made it to the Bangalore Pride today. I really hope he sees his impact. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/5KuQaYBFB1
omg. namjoon's UN speech helped me accept myself as bi and inspired me so much. it's because of him that i finally gathered the courage to come out and speak myself. and unfortunately i couldn't go there for some reason, even though I'm from bangalore. seeing this makes me so

You shouldn't talk about xenophobia, you couldn't take a simple meme on Deepika. @firkey_ was using his freedom of speech but you couldn't handle criticism. Just because I don't like BTS, doesn't mean I hate chinese. I love Kim-Jong-Un. You're just another WOKE DEEPTARD.
???? How could u say that’s just the way she talks? There’s a difference between her YouTube audience and then the audience at the UN speech. Any one with common sense would know that. It was a joke with no taste and out of place.
I rly do wish I was just fckin around when I say this BUT my only bts dream that I can recall is me picking up a phonemail and it's namjoon's voice reading out THE UN speech :DD
once EVERY single kpop artist has the same level of impact as bts , becomes recording academy members , delievers a un speech ,, then i can be up for that discussion.
i never knew that “love myself” was very important to our soul until President Namjoon’s UN speech, i never believe that hope will always help you reach the light till @BTS_twt , i‘ve always thought that every individual had a fixed thing yknow, like how namjoon+
On twt whenever we quote smthin with "Im crying" it doesnt actually mean we're crying just like how lol & lmao works, so since when did we start taking it seriously? We were all emotional about how bts were going to do a speech at THE UN so even if she really meant it, its okay
Meeting your old friend.....and telling her about @BTS_twt music ....and telling her about their life stories....all the records they make untill now....making her to listen the RM's speech in UN....is the best moment ever..... #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
In seventh grade. Months pass and I saw the UN speech, and a full year passed until I became a full fledged ARMY. This man is my dream guy. He is my standard. He inspires me to work harder, to keep my head down and work and let my success speak for times + @BTS_twt #RMisPerfectpic.twitter.com/R8kdoasAgd
Should I make myself sad and listen to namjoon from @BTS_twt UN speech lol
Hello! My name is Hope, 31. Fell hard for Namjoon. His beautiful UN speech is what solidified my love and admiration for him and @BTS_twt ot7 Ty for this thread. pic.twitter.com/EF551B2bvh
this is her style of humor, and shes always been ignorant about bts, if you watch her UN speech which was the same day as bts', it had the same kind of jokes painting armys as crazy, she thinks shes being funny but shes trying too hard and failing, her shows is full of that
BTS stood up there and gave a speech about all gender, races , etc. and she got up there and basically said fck all that. There’s a time and place even if she wanted to make that joke and the UN was def not that place.
Acheviments @BTS_twt made 1. Delivered a Bold Message at the UN BTS made history back in September by becoming the first K-pop group to address the United Nations. BTS leader RM delivered a powerful and heartfelt speech that carried a big message for today’s youth
@BTS_twt RM was just an ordinary boy and a rookie idol before. But know he spoke at the UN General speech and is one of the most succesfull people in the world. pic.twitter.com/Wmb7DCZb03

u all remember, when bts were to give speech, we literally got hold of unga livestream, like we were laughing that we gonna watch UN live stream and all were so cold and nervous until joon gave the speech, what a memorable day my god https://twitter.com/taehunnies/status/1197206149512278016 …
they already won the hearts of the peoples living on earth or who knows if the aliens also fell for them so they already have most beautiful award with them which speaks truth. they even gave speech in UN. keep ur awards with you BTS have our hearts. Eminem, we r with you
YES!!!!!! I asked him to watch RM's UN speech which he liked . He loved how Dope MV looks as if it's shot in one go . Then I made him watch "Save me" MV which is actually shot in one go. Then he returned to Mumbai but he sees my Insta stories
This is the man who gave UN speech I love him so much @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/OaMkQ9ZxP7
If you spread negativity against someone, then you directly go against Namjoon's UN speech, you go against what every member wishes. You don't deserve BTS and you don't deserve to be ARMY. This fandom is about love, happiness, and positivity. We don't claim y'alls negative asses.
bts are the generations leaders right now and they use the platform to spread important messages to young people all over the world. they are selfless and hardworking, they donate to charities, had a speech at the UN and all in all make me a better person. :)
i just did a class presentation about bts’ message (including their un speech) and i’m shaking omg i was so nervous

so...let me process this. my roommate said her bf was @the UN when Joon did his speech (he’s a cop & was doing security) & he said bts “embarrassed” themselves. he said all the representatives were looking around confused bc his speech was “off topic.” this is news to me pic.twitter.com/L0ipDccZMT
nahh still mad at how they were talking abt diversity and breaking barriers when bts have literally sold out the wembley stadium TWICE, had been charting in bb200 for 3x straight, had high chartings in hot100, made a whole un speech, made a total intense +
Youth? Tell that to my mother, who’s an army and in her 50s. Music has no age limit. Please take the time to look into their music, look at translated lyrics, and especially their speech at the UN. they mean so much to us, and a nom would’ve been so deserved.
omg kotshela, omg queens, im so sorry i didnt know, phheeww they had way more impact then bts becoming part of the recording acedmy members and also going to the UN to make a whole speech about their actual impact
They are unique and the most humble artist in this industry. They spread a good message trough their songs and speeches. You can watch their speech that Kim Namjoon the leader of @BTS_twt made at the UN . Please consider this
They appeal globally to young and old. They are role models who spread messages of love and hope through their records, concerts and the now famous UN speech. New years is a time for reflection and hope for the new year. BTS spread that message of hope every day through music.
this review on jung’s map of the soul persona, they found this book thanks to BTS’ UN speech and Namjoon’s words were extremely relatable to them. this is the kind of positive thing we need to see today. pic.twitter.com/5R55JxZUNR
The fact bts didn’t receive any Grammy nominations is bullshit. The fucking impact they’ve had through the messages in their music should be enough as it is, Namjoon doing the whole UN speech too, they’ve clearly had a huge impact on the world and they deserve to be rewarded.
Even if it doesn’t, the world is going to give @BTS_twt so much more than that award. That award doesn’t define success at all. The sold out concerts, the selling out of personal products the charities the UN speech. That’s success. And there’s not many people who have that. https://twitter.com/taenate12/status/1197235423661219844 …
"maybe i made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me." — kim namjoon of bts me, in tears, watching the un speech: wow, straight fire, shakespeare could never
I highly recommend you listen to their music and read their lyrics. @BTS_twt music has literally saved people’s lives, no joke. First though, here is their UN speech. #LoveYourselfSpeakYourselfhttps://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
BTS-The first korean music band to deliver a speech at UN BTS- First Korean act to win Billboard 3 times in a row and perform there BTS-The first ever since The Beatles to sell out Wembley within 90 mins BTS- First ever act which made Saudi Arabia to change its laws #ThisIsBTSpic.twitter.com/COYRwAdUB6

they have given a speech at the UN and have started a campaign called "Love Myself" to end violence . their music has helped me see the world in a different way and learn what love truly means . if you put up this billboard with bts it would mean so much to bts and their fandom
ditto, the UN speech. their music doesnt just garner music awards #ThisIsBTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/busanbreeze/status/1197205297133166592 …
BTS gave a speech at the highest attended & viewed UN meeting. Each member of BTS has donated thousands (yes you read that right each member there are 7) thousands of dollars to colleges, low income orphanages, private and public schools, children in need. #ThisIsBTS

UN speech and BB Top Group, definitely #ThisIsBTS
which bts achievement makes y'all the proudest? to me, the UN speech #ThisIsBTS @BTS_twt
They were invited by UN to give a speech to the young generation last year. Their words really inspires me. The speech even became the teaching material for English in many Asia countries. They’re unique to me. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg

speech at the UN. The members and us fans donated millions of dollars to organisations that help poor families, sick children or clean the oceans and they work together with unicef! I hope that helped you to understand why BTS is sich a big part of our life
At the end of the day the numbers prove that @BTS_twt dominated all charts, sold out stadium tours all over the world, gave a speech at UN UNICEF, changed the world for better, have millions of fans that constantly donate to charities+

Yeap, totally agree. UN speech @BTS_twt
UN Speech and XCeleste’s BTS Contribution to Music @BTS_twt
I think the UN speech would be the best video to show. It's presents @BTS_twt Love Yourself message but also shows non-armys the influence they have on a global stage outside of music, stead of just 'look how many awards, videos, etc. they have'.
Based on the editor note in the article. PaperMag chose the Lisa Frank direction because it was inspired by BTS's 'Love Yourself' campaign & UN speech. It's also right on par with the recent trend of nostagia-based marketing. It's not my taste but I love the message & the article pic.twitter.com/mQrP8wY4nr
UN Speech for sure and the latest Love Myself Global Campaign video (http://youtu.be/Eo_mo5vA7tw ). It shows how @BTS_twt's music really does brightens & lightens our hearts. I believe both of those get the point across. good luck!
Maybe a collage of videos? The Big Hit logo where it says Music & Artists for Healing says a lot. Then snippets from the UN speech followed by comic relief that demonstrates how BTS is so relatable that it gets ARMY to participate. pic.twitter.com/cceHYEL2oY

They didn't listen during the "I started to listen to the voices of other's" in joon's un speech... BTS doesn't need to conform to what you think won't get them dragged... Why do they want the approval of close-minded people so bad, that's only giving them the power...

Me, RM's UN speech impressed me. Then finding out he wrote a lot of lyrics for @BTS_twt songs. Then finding out the other members, each and everyone of them, are also contributing to their music and performances. Then BU. And there are no skips in their albums, it's all

First, music trascends language, like classical does, second, i wasnt talking about kpop in general, idk about that, but BTS DOES have really socially aware lyrics and spread a rlly good message, i mean, not for anything they did a campaign with unicef and gave a speech in the UN
I just walked on my mum watching BTS UN speech, what the hell wjhwhwjs
but actually I want to know @BTS_twt better bcs of that powerful speech of uri leader Kim Nam Joon at UN
Namjoon's UN speech was my first time seeing them on screen @BTS_twt
bts had speech at UN,love myself campaign with unicef.sold out stadiums like wembley,rose bowl.should I continue?one thing bp can achieve is views,at album sales they are nothing,not to mention their live performances,just listen to their mr removed,they cant sing while dancing.
Ofc the UN speech is still my most favourite memory ever. I was at work being so freakin' nervous! And then Joon delivered the most beautiful speech ever. BBMAs Top Duo/Group win is truly this year's highlight so far. We were so ready to lose with pride then we won!
My favourite @BTS_twt & #BTSArmy memories: - being so nervous before Namjoon's UN speech & then crying so hard after - Persona cb, assuring armys from other timezones to sleep "you can count on us" - "...SO THE BILLBOARD AWARD GOES TOOOOO? WHO? WHO? ...BTS!!!" What's yours?

My bias speech in the UN Assembly changed my life. When he spoke about loving himself with his faults, I teared up and actually reflected on what made me happy he's truly an inspiration @BTS_twt

One moment that truly solidified my devotion to @BTS_twt was Namjoon’s speech at the UN. I knew then that they were more than a talented goofy boy band; they are instruments of change.
the fact that i convinced so many people to give bts a chance bu showing them the un speech
namjoon's UN speech, then superstar bts (their songs)
I see why this is your mantra :) His words are always so moving. I heard the UN speech 2 weeks after I started listening to BTS n I instantly knew that I'm listening to the right people I hope you win this
@RedoNatalia @chimmyjiminniee " I have many faults and many fears, but i'm going to embrace myself as hard as i can. " -Kim Namjoon, UN Speech. @BTS_twt
Yes they do and their okay with it. My dad jokingly dances to bts songs when I listen to it and it always makes me laugh. He also played bts in the car when he found out I liked bts. My mom watched rms speech at UN before I even stanned so and she would bring up bts when I’m sad
To answer ( @BTS_twt ) Mr. Kim Namjoon's UN speech, Electrical pulses makes my heart beat. BUT YOU, MY LOVE, makes my heart skip a beat. #RM

When I heard joonie's UN speech @BTS_twt
namjoons un speech hit like exactly a month after i came out as trans and nonbinary to my mom, only because bts gave me the courage to. When i heard it i cried so hard knowing for certain that i was supported by my heroes, that namjoon would be proud of me https://twitter.com/lesbianjoonie_/status/1195043959824900096 …
Do y'all have any favourite "BTS say trans rights" other than Joon's UN speech and BT21 nonbinary? If so, what are those?
UN speech
the UN speech @BTS_twt
Their UN Speech too

She really got inspired with namjoon's UN speech, but I think her favorite BT21 character is Cooky because it's pink
if i ever need a reminder that i'm in this @BTS_twt shit for life, I watch the UN speech again. Never fails to leave me in awe and in love.
i cried after hearing the UN speech. It changed my life
Fellow ARMY, I need your help. I can't find the tweet this picture is from. It's a video, and I'm sure it was after their UN speech, but I haven't been able to track it down. Do you know when it was posted? @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/TT8sjpN263
I just realized that ms. henrietta fore graduated from my high school WHAT THE HECK I CANNOT BELIEVE AN ALUM FROM MY SCHOOL MET BTS AND TOOK PICTURES WITH THEM and the fact that bts was making history by giving the speech at un WOW W O W O W https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044264299231956992 …
a few years ago I wouldn’t tell people something bothered me, made me sad or angry but after namjoon’s speech at the un I really thought i should stand for what I believe and not let people walk over me @BTS_twt thank you namjoon
jimin checking out those guys, bts checking out that dude, bt21 nb, stigma, hyyh taejoon/yoonkook/jihope storylines, yoongs saying he doesn’t care about gender, joon’s un speech, bts clapping at imagine dragons speech, tae smiling at the lgbt poster, referring lgbt books/artists https://twitter.com/lesbianjoonie_/status/1195043959824900096 …
I knew I was an Army when I heard Namjoon's love yourself speech at UN,it helps me a lot whenever I want to give up on myself #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
wow its so amazing that even the younger generation is affected by @BTS_twt 's message! It makes me think about the video where two children knew Namjoon's UN speech by heart!
Gonna miss the LoveYourself speak yourself tour so much. An era that made me an ARMY. An era that helped me love myself, an era that gave us the best solos, beautiful lyrics, un speech, growing popularity. Really gonna miss it

I hope it can work, obviously I don't talk to her parents about what makes her upset cause she trusts me a lot. I just hate to see her like this i guess, she loves BTS too and we once also talked about UN speech. I think you’re right i just have to wait
Hey! @BTS_twt Rm your speech in UN became our project we have to translate it in our own language and it was very had yet its is truly inspiring https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1194573118569738242 …
Aaaw @BTS_twt RM UN Speech audio with springday instrumental as bgm is there in sound cloud ..aaaaghhh it's sooo good ,He sounds tooo good, #bts #MAMAVOTE
While listening songs in soundcloud, namjoon’s UN speech randomly came up. It leaves a warm feeling of assurance every time I hear it. And I can’t thank him enough. Thank you @BTS_twt for existing in my life :)
Today I told my dad about @BTS_twt and how happy they make me. I was telling him bout RM's speech at the UN and he asked me to show him his picture. After I did he said that namjoon has the calmest face ever and he's glad that I'm idolizing the right person. pic.twitter.com/bwiRb0KzOq

BTS paved the way!! BTS is the best Also this Friday I’m facilitating a group and my topic is about loving yourself, I’m be talking about RMs UN speech so nervous.
Its not late to do that. You may have watched the speech Namjoon gave at the UN on behalf of BTS but I'll request you to watch it again, paying attention to the words and I'm sure you'll make a different statement from this. Love, Leeson Fighting.
I am not a huge BTS fan, but Nomjoon's words from his UN speech apply to our current situation. All fandoms should be united for this fight! "Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and mistakes." https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg #WonhoCantBeErased #스타쉽_책임을_지세요
is true of all 7 members in reality, listen to RM's UN speech and you'll find him more eloquent than the clowns trying to sort out Brexit. So @BTS_twt #KimTaehyung #BTSARMY on this #IPurpleYouDay I hope you are happy and well. xx
Okay but what a day. I'm home and watching BTS videos and rereading Joon's UN Speech. I really glad that I have @BTS_twt in my life.

title MV's. Your work reminds me again how detailed and how genius BTS art is. 2) It was easy to follow your line of thought and it was structured so well. I love that you included the part from the UN speech. You are amazing. Thank you so much for sharing it.
𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 i have with bts was when namjoon made a speech at the UN general assembly, “we have learned to love ourselves, so now i urge you to speak yourself.” - kim namjoon. #memorieswithbts
So many beautiful memories come to mind when thinking of BTS: UN speech, listening for the 1st time Mono, feeling by songs like Magic Shop, Sea & 1,2,3! And an unforgettable 1 was going to their concerts! Thank you #BTS for being part of my life @BTS_twt #MemoriesWithBTSpic.twitter.com/yHAdoqFofN
all of them, but top 3 is - the first song and mv i saw - first ‘BTS event’ i experienced - RM’s UN speech and my favorite ~ “it was only possible because I had my other BTS members by my side, and because of the love and support of our ARMY fans.” #MemoriesWithBTSpic.twitter.com/KbSPIvEKrJ
Hi, may I put this in here, too? It’s their speech to the UN, about their message. This was the very first time I knew of @BTS_twt. I became a fan. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg - thank you!
#MemoriesWithBTS (15) I don’t know exactly when i specifically stanned bts, but maybe watching namjoon’s full un speech was the catalyst for me to give in and be an army. It was the first time i cried for a kpop artist.
#MemoriesWithBTS (7) As each year went by, bts were becoming popular and continued to show up on my feed; their behind the scenes in save me mv, pinterest wallpapers, palawan summer package, fake love memes, iconic bst, idol collab with nicki and mma, and namjoon’s un speech.
I remember watching the UN livestream leading up to BTS & then holding my breath for the entirety of Joon's speech. It didn't matter that English was his 2nd language. He had written the most beautiful speech that stood out from the rest. #MemoriesWithBTSpic.twitter.com/MaEO3jPyX9
i already watched funny bts compilations on youtube , i then proceeded to watch the UN bangtan bomb and UN speech on loop and then i added the rap line mixtapes
The un speech has to be in the top of the list! My heart swelled with pride that day when Namjoon delivered his self-written speech before the whole world and inspired millions of people. @BTS_twt makes me proud and happy like no other! #MemoriesWithBTS
Since I started stanning BTS my mental health as become much better. Now whenever I feel sad or like I have no worth and reason to be alive I listen to their music and to their concert’s/UN speech and they comfort me. #MemoriesWithBTS
BTS found me when no one else did. I was literally crying inside my room when I accidentally saw Namjoon's UN speech on Facebook. And I must say, his words literally change my whole perspective that time. It was a truly heartwarming experience. @BTS_twt #MemoriesWithBTS
"RM's speech" at UN General Assembly is one of the best BTS memory. It was heart touching pic.twitter.com/krE6wv9Rrx

So many memories with bts, the 1st mv I watched,the 1st comeback,1st deasang, their speech at the UN, their 1st BBMA, their AMA performance and I cherish each and every memory. But the best part of being an army was meeting my army fam. @BTS_twt thank you #MemoriesWithBTSpic.twitter.com/bj0cXDEdCY
The UN Speech will forever be the most memorable memory. I couldn't be more prouder of them #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/vP3S8Z3tM2
bbms, mama, un speech, Grammy attends are the best memories for Armys. I have so many amazing memories which I forget cause I can't remember anything #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt
Part 4 Until on one moment, I watched RM speech at UN. BOOM. His speech hit me like a stroke. WOW. I started to cry like a river. The feeling of being unloved, unspesific, unsignificant, worthless, and every single bad thought automaticly went away. #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt
joon's un speech will forever be the most memorable thing for me as an army #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/CetUNNtdvw
Namjoon's UN speech will always be one of the greatest things to ever happen. I said what I said. #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Gejyk15b1S
Some memories will be mma and mama 2018, gda and mama 2017, UN speech.. I still remember how excited we all were when Joon was delivering the speech. Also when they won bbmas top duo group and we all weren't even expecting and we all were so awestruck. #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt
One of my favourite memories is definitely the UN speech. It was so inspiring and made me realise how lucky I am to be even a small part of something so amazing. #MemoriesWithBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/JYXdRsC3w4
I have a few in mind, one is when I started crying over them crying over their first or second daesang, another is me crying over namjoon saying "gender identity" in the un speech, another is me crying becuz of class and me listening to bts to calm down, just me crying jsdfklsk
STAN TWT HELLO so for my english presentation i'll be analysing bts' un speech along with how the media responded. can ya'll help me find the original article in which the times criticised joon for his english?
me presenting my UN Speech since Bts paved the way for me: pic.twitter.com/wTgUxSVONW
True! This is how I got sucked in this wonderful Army world: UN speech introduced me to them, then their MVs, lyrics, & performances got me impressed, then RUN BTS sealed the deal.
YES OMG I fell In love with him after the UN speech and trivia love
Namjoon's UN SPEECH always touch my heart. He is indeed our best leader And our inspiration #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
My brother asked me to help him with his English, so we watched Namjoon’s speech at the UN and he tried to translate what he was saying with my help... I guess you probably have a new fan now @BTS_twt
Bts got more awards, more hits, more album sales, more songs, more albums, ACTUAL SOLD OUT concerts,they did a speech in UN, they were at the Grammys and so on Them: but they have more views on yt #Peoplechoosebts #ARMYsChoiceBTS #BTS
Oct 2018 - Mic Drop reeled me in and Namjoon’s UN Speech made me stay I’ve never been so involved and invested in any celebrity or artist before @BTS_twt So glad I found them #BuyPersonaOniTunespic.twitter.com/xGoDGqPZ26
Namjoon's UN speech and some clips on FB cuz I used to watch k-dramas lol
But also their work with the UN for the Love Myself campaign (c’mon, that was a beautiful speech. SOME voting members MUST know about them for that), PLUS the charity work that theyve inspired, surely theyve made about the most cultural impact than any other act lately?
I’m sorry that I’m ranting, but it’s so irritating how people can’t let others enjoy something harmless just because they don’t like it. She even had the AUDACITY to say that the UN speech was for PR! People disregard how much @BTS_twt has helped some of us just bc they’re Korean pic.twitter.com/c6oOgAwsRI
I watched Joon's UN Speech again and im amazed at how i already memorized most part of his speech without even intending too. maybe, it just simply went straight to my heart the first time i heard it @BTS_twt #bts #MAMAVOTE

#ThePeopleChooseBTS We for sure do! @BTS_twt inspires us every day to love ourselves and to support others in their journey to love themselves. Here is the video we made in honor of the anniversary of their UN Speech. https://youtu.be/t8cTuNMRMeY
Of course they wouldn’t. They stand for the exact opposite. The literal title of the last tour and RM’s UN speech was Speak Yourself.
Hey not educated kid, 1. research 2. take out your racist mind from your brain and watch BTS interviews and mv, lyric videos!!!!3. watch behind the scene of BTS backstage, mv, 4. watch variety shows 5. Watch their Speech’s at Their concerts, and UN
to love myself even more BTS made me a better person.I am very thankful to them bec they compose a lot songs that heals everyone of us.I remember of what RM said in the UN Speech that"No matter who you are,where you from, your gender identity and skin colour,JUST SPEAK YOURSELF +
You said it well! All of them are still reflections of Joon during different times in his life, and it's an honor to have witnessed that through his solo music. Reminds me of one part of their UN speech, "Yesterday's me is still me." Rap Monster or RM, he's still Kim Namjoon.
No one evr said bts were lgbt icons, they just said bts support the community amd you came saying they never did anything, that the un speech was crap and mmm shared your thoughts. Again go hospital plz
Being BTS stan doesn't mean you have to follow everything they do. I can have an opinion and disagree with some things they do. Anyways, I wasn't saying that Namjoon's speech was bullshit. I meant UN speechs are useless for LGBT rights.
The most impressive event about BTS is the UN speech by RM of BTS. His English was really nice, and the content of speech was also. #snucelebrityculturefall19
to be honest, i understand where you're coming from. i think you mean bts' support hasn't been as explicit as mamamoo's. but they have shown it. the un speech was not directed to lgbtq people but it included them, it was to whoever needed to listen to it, say, feel marginalized+
hey @BTS_twt just wanted to let you know that you (and your speech at the UN) have inspired children to take part in model united nations organized by educational institutions. they truly are following the speak yourself agenda
I was a casual listener for kpop including BTS, never stan any group. I never bought album or merch. Then i read Namjoon speech for UN so~
y'know when tae & kook sang "the me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow, i'm learning how to love myself" in answer: love myself & joon's "i have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was, & for who I hope to become" in his UN speech, i felt that. @BTS_twt
sksksksk i can relate .i started taking BTS seriously only after namjoon's un speech
I have to choose one song for presentation and I decided to choose Epiphany because this song is very precious to me and it means a lot to me. I also talked about BTS has a speech at UN and open a #ENDviolence and #loveyourself campaign.pic.twitter.com/cYYaLZPYFM

Yeah I read the whole thing. https://mashable.com/article/kpop-twitter-fancam-reply-trend/ …
Have you ever tried BTS without preconceived judgments? Fans aside, they create all their own music. It is critically acclaimed and their lyrics are deep and nuanced. BTS even has a book about surviving mental illness in South Korea. Try out this UN speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
i was JUST listening to your un speech i love you so much joonie
To be honest...before I heard his great songs I saw accidentally his speech in the UN...so I looked into his music. ..and here I am! A big fan of King Namjoon #RMpic.twitter.com/oTqq7G0nte
Yes, his UN speech was so powerful. Glad you came across it.
I saw his speech at the UN ... I wondered how intelligent and confident he is! It was my first day as an Army pic.twitter.com/AZKjwbcaNt

What about BTS makes you hate them so much? Is it just the annoying fancam spammers within the fandom, or is there something more? Here is a UN speech they gave in case you want to give it a shot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
bro Did you even think this tweet through before writing it. BTS helped her get more open minded and Have you heard the UN speech I guess not?
it could’ve been armys who’ve opened their eyes and made them realize things?? or it could be that bts influenced them to be more kind and accepting of other people’s differences...like namjoons whole un speech exists

Let me serve you some tea. It's @BTS_twt that is ruling the world. Listen to Kim Namjoon's (RM of @BTS_twt ) UN speech and you'll know why it's them.
Don't buy into those preconceived judgments. BTS's music is critically acclaimed and they have been given awards by the president himself. Their lyrics and stories are deep and their success is organic. Heres an example of their speech given at the UN. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
#OnlyBTScan make my parents smile watching their UN Speech @BTS_twt
Plz go and listen to Namjoon's UN speech about loving ourselves and others. Also, humble yourselves. BTS has also been trending a lot in the past few days too. Finally, we just want Wonho back because he was wrongfully let go because of false sexual harassment allegations. pic.twitter.com/G4QFcQPwic
I still remember i went to toilet so many times before RM, BTS speech at UN. The most nervewrecking moment in my life for BTS! And of course its was the first time i watched UN live streamed video lmao.
I saw his Problematic Man Episode in YT last April 2019. Got curious who was this genius and gorgeous man. Then I got to know his name there. I searched for his name in Google and YT , then saw his UN Speech. I watched all videos related to him and the members
bts didn’t write a whole series for love yourself, produced multiple songs that encourages you to accept you the way you are, went to unicef and gave a un speech about loving ourselves, gave ending ments and reminds us the same thing for you to give up easily on life!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this + un speech are things that made me cry the first time because of bts and it was so beautiful, the tears washed away so much... I knew right there that Im in this bangtan sonyeondan sht forever
#OnlyBTScan GET APPROVAL OF MY DAD TO STAN. AFTER THE UN SPEECH MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY FLOORED AND SINCE THEN, MY LOVE FOR BTS HAS STOPPED PESTERING HIM We love jintellectual parents
Anyways have you guys checked out BTS’ UN speech and donated to their #ENDviolence campaign? You guys should also donate to Arbor Day Foundation.pic.twitter.com/CTZA2duuaD
#OnlyBTScan make me create a whole another twitter just for BTS stuff bc i couldnt shut up about it and it was taking up my timeline. The exact date i made a stan was the UN speech.
But don't hate. Hate makes this world worse and cruel. Don't be a racist. Everyone matters. You matter. 'No matter what skin color you are, no matter what your gender identity is'-RM , BTS UN speech. You matter. pic.twitter.com/jYEHDMVu9L

ONU? You mean UN speech?
“I hope there could be a day where you would be an inspiration to others just like how RM and the rest of BTS is for you” I think I cried a bit there. Had an interesting session with my students today regarding inspiration and being who you want to be and i shows the UN speech!
Our President's iconic inspirational speech at the UN
@BTS_twt Namjoon's UN speech. I owe a lot to this speech because this was how BTS found me.

BTS first band to give a speech at UN first kpop band to perform at BBMA's, first kpop band to sell out wembley which has 90k capacity and that too two days first what not?!So would u mind explaining how we want Exo's achievements when BTS was the first to do these all??

The UN speech - what makes them “qualified” to speak before the UNGA. My country (Philippines) is a modest (but ardent) market for Kpop but I was never drawn even by the viral Psy. So I checked my prejudice at the door, watched their MVs, read their lyrics. And here I am.
remember after the un speech everyone was telling their stories and sharing in tears and love bc joonie and bts invited us all to speak ourselves? that was such a beautiful day idk like so many people are constantly silenced and the fact that they weren’t on that day meant a lot
Me too. As an English teacher working with teenagers, I’m willing to demonstrate the power of a great example, esp. from someon who attracts our admiration by his human nature. #bts_rm #RM #rm un speech @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/Koreaboo/status/1191241163388276736 …
I have to do a project where I choose an art representation and create an other different one out of the first one, I'm pretty excited bc I'm picking 'Singularity', BTS's speech at the UN and 'Fake love' as my inspiration.

Well b4 finding @BTS_twt I watched a lot of baby pandas vids on YT bec I had 2 see smtg that made me smile vs sad news. Then in 9/18 on the news, I saw this amazing young man spk at UN surrounded by his bandmates & my life chged 4ever. Blessed was that speech & everyday since

I’m a middle aged woman & very proud 2 b ARMY Honestly I heard Kim Namjoon’s UN speech b4 even hearing a single note sung/rapped or dance move watched or lyrics read & I was n complete awe. Then the research started & I loved every step, note & word w/in @BTS_twt galaxy
Their speech at the UN, it's memorable
bts were already famous before collaborating with anyone. accept it. before halsey bts were the first group to win a bbma , perform at the bbmas, get nominated for a grammy, sold out world tours, were the first group on ellen, gave a speech at the un, and theres a lot more
Every moments of @BTS_twt are special, but two most specials for me are UN speech and BBMAs Top Duo/Group
1st caught attention: UN speech 1st Bias: Curr Bias: Bias wrecker: but OT7 1st MV: Micdrop Fav song: there’s too many to even pick & it depends on day/mood Pass on to mutuals : @boy_meets_hoebi @kimtxehyungie_ @btscutxe @jiminielovelly
1st caught your attention: Fire MV, started hardcore stanning at RM's UN speech. 1st Bias: RM/Jin Curr Bias: Tae/JK/Suga Bias Wrecker: Hobi/Jimin/OT7 now! 1st BTS MV: Save Me (first fav!) Fav song: Can't choose! Pass to mutuals @marlenelb84 @MomoJiminie

speech at the UN to teach my students love, youth, compassion, respect, dreams; who use the lyrics of their songs for that they learn to fight for justice and against hatred. Before music, dance and fun, BTS taught me, despite my age , to be humble, attentive to the others
Anyway, your “mysterious” group attended Grammys, gave a UN speech, sold out a 90k stadium twice, and is part of the Recording Academy.. Just say you wanna be as relevant as BTS and go
There are so many but the speech at the UN is definitely one of them. It helped me a lot to reflect on myself. #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
2018. Tbh I wouldn't have given them that much attention if they hadn't given the speech at the UN. I legit thought: they must be seriously important, must give them a try!...LOVE YOU GUYS @BTS_twt
2018, when i happened to watch the UN speech of one yt creator lily singh and then she met the boys.
TY very much 4 the updates. U r much better than the C*N Breaking news stories which are pretty much the same breaking news from dawn till dusk. That channel brought me 2 BTS via UN speech broadcast but now I’m happy 2 have a Bangtan galaxy 2 explore w my ARMY fam. TY @BTS_twt
don’t let people convince you that bts is unknown. with the UN speech, media coverage, and general invasion of pop culture they have made, anyone who doesn’t know about them is making a conscious effort not to at this point.
when will yall actually do your research on BTS and stop bein racist bigots. you dont do a speech at the UN, become one of Times most influential leaders, or 2nd since the Beatles in legendary groups, or have a name that is powerful just by itself, and then say no one knows you. https://twitter.com/SethAbramovitch/status/1190754138532876288 …
I have lots of regrets. I still do. But because of @BTS_twt and specially Namjoon's speech at the UN, i've come to accept my shortcomings, weaknesses & face my fears to make the most out of life. It's a process, but each day i'm creating a better me, not for others but myself.
Agreed. I tried to show her the UN speech at which point she blocked ME. I think that says a lot. She had no interest in learning a lesson about humble loving people. This also reminded me that I opened this account just to focus on music. So focus on @BTS_twt I shall.

do BTS realize how big they are ?? like they have millions of fans worldwide thag love them despite the language barrier ??? they gave a speech at the UN??? people fly to different states/countries to see them??? they are the biggest group rn???
BTS has made a huge cultural impact. It is very telling that you can say a k-pop star has nothing to do w/culture after saying you don't know what it is. BTS spoke at the UN the same day Trump did. Their speech was heavily covered and praised. https://youtu.be/kWMzL20sImg

during the ly era i began to love myself :’) especially after joon’s un speech and after attending their first ly concert in 2018 i learned how to accept and love myself thanks to bts. and it feels so good to say that i do !
tbh I am so grateful that my first step getting into bts was the un speech because its aniversary marks one for me too, even if I didn't become an army right away It started my love and respect for them on the spot
No, nothing with the boys. I just want them to know that if anything about their past comes up, unless it’s unforgivable, I’m staying by their side. I take RM’s UN speech seriously. +
UN speech and everyone was so fascinated by the fact that a foreign group has become so global with such influential stats. i don’t know, i just always feel so confident when speaking about bts. i need to make another playlist for the songs i’ll play in class and what they mean
remember bts were laughing so much that namjoon had to say that this needs to be serious just like they were during the un speech? pic.twitter.com/w6wPzPZbCq

BTS and ARMY is a 2-way relationship. They have taught us how to love yourself, love myself. ARMY has seen the way BTS spread love by giving speech at the UN, donations on their birthdays or even providing food for ARMYs who attended music shows. This is what they hv taught us.
me going to the un in 2020: wow, I’m really at the place of that iconic speech friend: the one the president gave? me: lol no, the one where kim namjoon spoke as he had the rest of bts along side him https://twitter.com/hoyapedia/status/1189672229015097344 …
1. BTS 2. Their hard work, the way they influence million of us and campaign love myself! 3. keep on humble then made their diss song, here improvenya mereka yang dianggap jelek oleh karya dibalas dengan karya 4. Achieve a lot of awards, speech in UN, attend Grammy, Stadium Tour. pic.twitter.com/YcBna9K1lf
Thousand times i saw Namjoon speech at the @UN and wonder... what if in the next album he put his speech become a song. It.. will... be... so... (can't even imagine) #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
So true! This tour to speak yourself after his UN speech in NYC is passion. They took his words into performing & made us love yourself all over again in a true form, I am grateful & in tears as well, this tour was profound. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg … @BTS_twt
#BTS @BTS_twt I became an Army after that iconic UN speech #LoveYourselfSpeakYourselfhttps://twitter.com/GlblCtznUK/status/1189482293326467072 …
I can’t believe we’re saying goodbye to the Love Yourself era..like.. what? It’s been such an important movement for everyone. the boys, the fans, the music industry. Not to mention Unicef and the speech at the UN. There’s been so much growth. Wow. #LoveYourselfForever @BTS_twt
Yup one of my biggest regrets I knew them for more than an year I mean I liked RM's UN speech and I knew that BTS exist but unfortunately became an army this year
Everything in Namjoon's UN speech #BTSxThinkFLASH @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/bangtanUAE/status/1189583592629919746 …
im listening to @BTS_twt UN Speech and im literally in tears and im at work :(
@BTS_twt I finally made it and you're the ones I wanna thank the most. I immediately got inspired by joonie's UN speech and I decided to write my university thesis about it. I'm so lucky to call you my best friends because that's what you are to me. 정말 고마워요, 사랑해요. pic.twitter.com/nIEvxsBQuP
so i was reporting in class earlier when my classmate who was an egg told me to move to the next slide when i played BTS’ UN speech. bitch i dont care let the president tell you something about proper speech delivery
Now there are only a few thousand more people listening to you, the whale has made its call reach everyone. Your UN speech was the moment the whole world looked at you, I can say that baby...

BTS won their first & + BBMA, Their first AMA, won many daesangs, went to UN and made a speech in the UN, where invited to the Grammys, receive a medal from Korea & where called the biggest boy group on the planet during the love yourself era and the thing I have to say is: https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/595748810380414978 …
Lastly, through the rough times, when I am crying, I sit in a corner, put in my earbuds and listen to BTS and listen to Namjoon's speech from the UN. Thank you @BTS_twt once again for being important in my life.
what are your guys’ favorite lyrics or quotes from bts? its a hard choice between magic shop & namjoon’s un speech ㅠㅠ
Well yeah, BTS actually has a song that scorns their toxic fans like that. Fortunately, those koreaboos are just a very loud minority. BTS themselves are very loving and respectful, so most fans try to follow that message- like in this UN speech. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
I'm slowly making 43 years old listen to BTS by her free will. It started cause her son listens to BTS and spent the summer learning Hangul, she complained in class but she is really open minded and that helped all I had to do was send her the link of the UN speech and post some+
[29/10] 'Make It Right' (both times the remix) on radio, P3! The radio host mentioned how both Lauv and BTS openly talks about mental health, and for BTS case, brought up the UN speech as an example! #MAMAVOTE #bts @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/rsuw85xcc8
the ly era will always be superior, it was the era that made me love myself and it gave us amazing memories that we won’t forget, for example, the UN speech, bts on amas, bts on billboard, the citi field concert, bts on ellen, bts on jimmy fallon... it have my heart always.
Scenery, Winter Bear, Tonight, part of Decalcomania. We got Malta. We got the UN Speech heard round the world. We got Speak Yourself. We got loved y'all, we got loved. #WeLoveYouNamjoon #ThankYouBTS #SpeakYourselfTheFinal_D3 @BTS_twt
no one cares and no one will see this but anyways... today our english teacher told us to give her some video recommendations to watch someday in class that have to be in english and be special & educational.. i send her the bts un speech
#ThankYouBTS! I found you during one of my most difficult times in college when I felt utterly hopeless. I stumbled upon the UN Speech one day and thereby my journey with you began. You give me hope everyday, @BTS_twt. pic.twitter.com/wrmWjVsQfF
joonie thankyou for always speaking wise words, thankyou for allowing us to understand we are important and should speak ourselves. The highlight of this era is definitely your UN speech and i will never be more thankful for that. You speak such wise words all the time which help
I an tell that Bts changed every army's life. It's amazing how people started to share their story when namjoon gave that un speech. And may I say that I too shared my story and was happy about it. I was no longer hiding myself with my shadow. I was no longer that person who
Hi Nam Joon Good Night You are so great to Be A Leader of BTS And I Never Forgot Your Speech IN UN Thanks to the Lord God Father Love Me and Make Me see your Speech IN UN on TV I pray to God Care Nam Joon’s Mind and Walk in God's own heart on the road IN Christ Jesus Name Amen
"please use me, please use bts to love yourself because everyday you taught me how to love myself through your tweets, letters" and joon's UN speech
were always there for me and their words, their songs, the UN speech, but also even just the concerts' ending ments held and still hold a special place in my heart. they all helped me, even if they weren't here, i always felt their love, in a way. so thank you, bts. ♡
we love you joonie! thank you for saving us, teaching us how to love ourselves, thank you for your speech at the UN, thank you for trivia love and thank you for this wonderful tour
alright i have my three hour english exam tomorrow so i might write down the whole of the bts UN speech instead of actually doing it
It's okay Joon Eventho Love Yourself Speak Yourself Era has ended, we won't forget the journey, what you said during UN Speech, we'll keep learning how to love ourselves. Thank you so much @BTS_twt ARMY and BTS FOREVER
love yourself era.. truly a remarkable era for both armys and bts.. the un speech, billboard, grammys, etc... we did so much during this era.. it will never be forgotten..
It’s only a year and 18 days since I learned about BTS, but they have the greatest impact in my life. Listening to their songs everyday, watching their UN speech from time to time, living by their words of wisdom.
UN speech, BBMAs, Sold Out Stadiums (Citi Field, Wembley, Rose Bowl etc), SNL, GRAMMYS, UNICEF #ENDviolence, precious memories, We laughed, we cried, we fought, we sang and we danced and we will continue this sweet journey TOGETHER @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/j9AjRWzstc
There is a lot of happen in LYS era.. UN speech, BBMAs, Grammy, Citifield, Stadium tour, from love your self to speak your self, a lot of hatred been thrown to army and them but more love come to us. Love you @BTS_twt. Thank you for this amazing era. It teach us a lot of things.
Please check RMs UN speech
Award at the BBMAs alone the social artist awards, the entire UNICEF affiliation with BTS along with Armys helping to make the world a better place, with the Speak Yourself speech at the UN by RM, their first ever (indirect) Grammy nom and them as presenters out there, all the+
It's only been a year since I discovered @BTS_twt through their adorable interview with Jimmy Fallon. After that, I watched their UN Speech, introduction videos, and funny moment compilations in YouTube. (+) #SpeakYourselfTheFinal_D3pic.twitter.com/nm4pUG3xCD
Is it coincidence? Today we have sociocultural competence lecture & they told us to bring a significant object. Guess who is bringing her Army Bomb to class... If the teacher allows it, I'll also show the UN Speech #MAMA2019 #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/mRrDOOWBbY
BTS UN SPEECH IN MY MODULE I JUST REALIZED pic.twitter.com/kbByosXSqS
The UN speech because BTS have become much more than just a boyband. They've become our voices, our healers, our saviours, our friends and our magic shop. Them presenting not only their message but also our issues to a crowd of leaders and innovators is truly ICONIC.
army, if you see this, can you drop one or some of your proudest moment/s in this era? just anything. LOVE YOURSELF Era things let me start, this is just one. joonie’s speech at the UN. it’s everything. #LoveYourself #SpeakYourself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/e2PZH11uB0
True! Sept 2018: UN speech got me curious. One MV led to another, Run BTS, etc. March 2019: Flew from Manila, Ph to HK for 1st concert. Lined up 4 hrs for merch. April 2019: Bangkok. June 2019: Wembley D1 & D2. All for these 7 wonderful people who make me & the world smile.
My mom doesn't like bts because I fan girl too much but she said namjoon is handsome after his UN speech
Whenever I’m sad I listen to Namjoon a speech that he gave at the UN and I feel a lot better 10/10 would recommend aLsO ik no body asked but that speech is how I introduced my mom to BTS
So I have been having a crying session for quite some time now, so I decided to throw in some bts videos where they tell me to love myself etc. So after watching the un speech I’m even more of a crying mess!
After all , sadness is a human emotion. On top of leading interviews and acting as a bts representative. Wow that UN speech. He really bares a lot of the burden writing, producing, composing songs etc. I’m in awe like how does a hugely talented and brilliant human exist?????????
so I had an eng exam today where I had to write an essay on whether students should be allowed to protest during school hours. all I could think of was Namjoons speech at the UN, where he encourages us to speak ourself, so I wrote about bts for my speech & said we speak ourself
Me: oh you won't know them Adam: try me I might *smirk MY HEART* Me: ok they're a korean band called BTS Adam: ok idk them but why do you like them Me: oh they have inspiring lyrics and are dedicated to helping people love themselves *explains Unicef campaign and UN speech*
y’all know how lucky we are to be alive at the same time as BTS, just imagine being a peasant in plague era Europe. They never heard Jin’s high note in dionysus or witnessed namjoon’s UN speech. We’ve experienced more bts in one second than they did their whole lives.
Okay but that concert in the theater had me all types of emotional. Thank you to my Universe @BTS_twt . Now I'm about to reread Namjoon's UN Speech and sleep. pic.twitter.com/3klhrJYU54

Namjoon in the UN speech. My friend told me to watch it months before i got into BTS and i’ve thought he was the world’s biggest intellectual badass ever since
The LY era gave @BTS_twt their first Grammy now, their first #1 album on bb200, the unicef campaign with the UN speech, so so so much more. @BTS_twt , you inspired and helped so many people with this era.
was watching a revision lecture and the lecturer really wished for us to love ourselves and mentioned bts' UN speech EEEYEEEEEEEEE
ALSO! i feel like over the years, especially the past year since the UN speech + appearances at the 2019 GRAMMYS, SNL, the Colbert Show, GMAs + BWL amongst other releases, @BTS_twt have gotten much more visibility amongst the gp and one should hope, amongst RA voting members?
Namjoon's UN speech will forever be superior to any fancam!¹ #namjoom #kimnamjoon #RM @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xSopVcJSbM
1st of all thank you for this! My 1st encounter with BTS was when BTS delivered speech at the UN. It really meant A LOT to many of us, especially me, because after that speech, i became an ARMY. Here's a reminder on how good the message was https://twitter.com/monosrap/status/1093164712169070593?s=19 …
Namjoon was my first bias (i saw his UN speech that made me cry for like half an hour and i don't even know them back then). Then I went into a phase where I don't have any bias, and now I'm wn OT7. (but my friend tells me that I'm a hard Yoongi bias) #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
That’s what originally drew me 2 @BTS_twt When I hear the UN speech, I thought “Thank god there r young leaders like this n this ” Then when I learned how they spread that positivity among diverse millions resulting n acts of kindness by their fandom ARMY, I though we r saved
1. bts 2. they gave us hope through their lyrics, giving the world something they need to hear. they help me lot while i was going through my darkest 3. tampar dengan prestasi 4. a lot, salah satunya pas UN speech. juga campaignnya mereka
imagine if someone from the future showed up there and showed them a clip of there tours and the UN speech. how do you think they'd take it? #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt

Trying to get my nurse into bts. I told her to watch RM’s UN speech because that’s what got my grandmother into them. Wish me luck #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
I said they did a speech at the UN general assembly and he was like “wait a minute... are there dolls of them?” And then he wrote their name down to check them out lmao
Remember when Namjoon literally opened MAMA Hong Kong 2018 with his remarkable UN speech after less than 3 months of BTS becoming the first korean musical act to speak at the United Nations #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/38dCiAQtj0
he gave a speech at the UN in a foreign language and a foreign country (this was in new york while bts was on tour) and u can even see his hands shaking but he did an amazing job its been a year and it still hits me
i didn't think we'd be watching bts give a speech at the un in class and yet

“Really Army” I think it was something like that but if u want me to be serious then RM’s UN speech
I love all of them. But the one that made me start to love @BTS_twt is RM because of his UN speech then Jimin is my bias wrecker.
I found the UN speech at a time when i was finally taking deliberate steps in the journey to discovering what it means to really “love myself”... and at this point in my life, i no longer believe in “coincidence”
BTS Are Absolutely Necessary In This World *A girl who watched Namjoon's UN Speech for the 293948th time*
bts are an ambassador for unicef !! they do the #ENDviolence campaign <3 and last year they made a speech at the un ! :o

Namjoon didn’t do his speech at the UN nations for you to drop BTS fancams under another groups tweet when it was a simple tweet about a comeback....
Actually my friend recommended them in 2014(dark & wild) at that time I resisted to listen to k-pop music after 3 years my friends danced to we are bulletproof pt 2 I just admired there dance but didn't get in to the music after one year I heard RM UN speech+

i just done my speech that basically from the namjoon speech at UN and the whole class just gave me a standing ovation and i feel so proud thanks @BTS_twt u guys are my inspiration
So it’s Sunday & a #Mono kind of day. My reflection (pardon the pun) is that our #RM is a man with a talent to deliver meaningful words to #ARMY in the most beautiful way. Be it through a UN speech, a Cypher or other lyrics he is one in a million. We love you #Joonie @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/HgKi6hF7IZ
their music does have impac. Impact minus the vulgarity artists release. It sounds like you’re ridiculing the artist and fans when the un invited bts bc they saw them as leaders w global impact..its seems obvious why they were specifically invited to give a speech dont you think
+characters if BTS for the house pop up of BWL which was so cute then we showed the UN speech they were so proud they loved it and when I was talking a bit they told me to be quiet so they could listen I felt so happy :))) then we showed them the interview with Stephan Colbert
MEMBERS ABT SHOWED HER THE UN SPEECH BUT WE HAD TO CUT IT SHORT CUZ WE HAD TO GO TO DIFFERENT CLASSES BUT LIKE............. GUYS SHE REALLY LOVED BTS'S MESSAGE AND SAID THEIR LYRICS ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SHES EVER READ (AND THAT IF HER FUTURE PARTNER DOESN'T TALK TO HER SO
I'm slowly learning to love myself when I saw the UN speech I was in tears it resolved me to start taking care of me,I went to Chicago by myself to see @BTS_twt at Soldier Field I would have never done anything like that but ,I'm so glad I did,AN EXPERIENCE OF A LIFTIME https://twitter.com/tokigguk/status/1185936671604383745 …

+ they have the audacity to say that BTS is responsible for this just because of the UN speech...? like.. none of them is responsible?? well if they say so, im just simply curious where were their faves when they trend hate tags for ..?
They just looking for reasons to mock & discredit BTS speech & campaign with Unicef. They'll be saying "who wants to give speech in UN who is the reason why Palestine got occupied." Just like how they scream over BTS shouldn't perform at SA. But if it's their oppa, it's no prob.
My school's principal even showed bts's speech at UN and epiphany colour coded lyrics video to the entire students during school's official assembly. ARMY STAY WINING AND BTS PAVED THE WAY.PERIODT pic.twitter.com/xCA1piSHsb
I teared up reading your story. Im so far away but the energy in this twt radiated to where i am. Im glad to hear you're better now and i wasn't surprised that Namjoon's words got you. He did that on me too during UN speech. I pray you continue to be happier everyday. @BTS_twt
you’ll never feel more like you matter till you stan bts and listen to namjoons UN speech and the reasons behind the album concepts

Bts is the korean's ambassador ? Cant agree more . They deserved it . I can see their potential , their will , the messages tht they brought in their songs even namjoon's speech in UN or namjoon's word during the concerts
The group that brings 3b dollars to SK economy, the group that r members of the grammy academy, the group that won bb awards, the group that sold out stadiums, the group that broke records, the group that did a speech in the UN, the group that paved the way, The group BTS
From the amazing speech writer of the UN Speech on #EndViolence & #SpeakYourself comes the best quote: "and like, blah blah blah, yeah" I really luv these amazing yet goofy guys. @BTS_twt Calls Ed Sheeran “Santa Claus” After He Gave Them The Greatest Gift https://elvisduran.iheart.com/featured/elvis-duran/content/2019-10-18-bts-calls-ed-sheeran-santa-clause-after-he-gave-them-the-greatest-gift/#.Xaqr4oWyzhw.twitter …
It's their bangtan episode for UN speech https://youtu.be/5qi9_lKCXUQ
you better listen to more of BTS songs. he produces a lot of them. check 4 o'clock ft taehyung, his mixtape mono. gurl, you have a LOT of homeworks better start now have you watched the UN speech?
[Feel like NJ before his UN speech] Tomorrow, my cousin's getting married & I'm the Designated Officiant(civil union). My speech's almost done but the ending doesn't sound just right. Anyone has a quote that could make my speech memorable? @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/cRCDQQ6zTv
they literally just spew the same narrative that bts are responsible for how their fans act bonus points if they downgrade their unicef campaign or namjoon’s un speech because of their fandom
literally everyone knows bts bcs of their Love Yourself campaign or the UN Speech, even locals are lured by their charities and messages, the only one who would remember them by sales and records are pressed kpoppies because you have nothing against the other aspects bts has https://twitter.com/Andrea01710/status/1184911725302374404 …
#RM 'Speech UN "We began to hear remarkable stories from fans around the world. That our message helped him to overcome the difficult issues in life And how to start loving yourself ? Those stories always remind us of our responsibilities" @BTS_twt #TheGrouppic.twitter.com/SdojdjJc9P
i wrote joons un speech
she claims to be a fan of them yet talked shit about joon’s un speech (which matters a lot to him), said j!n had a bad voice, and /implies/ bts plagiarised some of their songs. knowing these types of accusations almost ruined their career and still pulling that shit with songs-
Also trashing other idol doesn’t make ‘your fave’ any better BTS paves the way! The other one paid and begged the way Also speaking Spanish doesn’t make things any better ok? Sis go educate yourself! Maybe read BTS UN speech pic.twitter.com/TC4B5TSiCR
I hope people don't make this notion that BTS speech at UN was inspired by the book when it's totally opposite The author of Carl Jung's theory got inspired by Joon's speech at UN & added it and thanked BTS & ARMYs in front. I hope new ARMYs know this & understand how big it is.
He was inspired by Joon's speech at UN and thanked BTS and ARMYs in front page.
The chapter 13 is literally base on UN speech, he was amazed by their speech so i dont think so know your name is going to be a thing but ...we never know, its BTS after all.
The author added it coz he was amazed by BTS UN speech.
i’m slowly introducing my mom to bts and i think she’s starting to like them. she was really impressed with namjoon’s UN speech
well, Dr. Murray Stein knows BTS and this book is published after namjoon's UN speech :)) https://twitter.com/_idk_nan_molla/status/1184586622236610561 …
It came out after the un speech, this book is dedicated to bts
That chapter was written because of the UN speech. This 'particular' book version was dedicated even dedicted to both the fandom and to bts
the persona album was inspired by the book 'map of the soul', about jungian psychology but the author released this book, 'map of the soul: persona' as a new version dedicated to bts, and used bts' work to explain jung's theories! so this book came out after the UN speech
It was inspired after BTS UN speech so yes, they even mentioned BTS in the book too :)))
whenever i tell anyone abt bts i always show them un speech video and then i start crying :D
To clarity: This book was published after his UN speech, the author, Dr. Murray Stein, knows of BTS. I just noticed the coincidence of it. Sorry if people were confused pic.twitter.com/cuIhG4sT4r
the album was based on Murray Stein's book 'map of the soul', which is about psychologist Carl Jung' theories Murray Stein released this newer book 'mots: persona' based on bts this distinction matters to me bc i want people to know namjoon's UN speech were his own words
ok baby army only finding out about the origin of mots now is cute but can ppl stop spreading the idea that namjoon got his UN speech from ch 13 when this particular version of the book was actually released AFTER, as a thanks to bts for reviving interest in Jungian psychology https://twitter.com/_idk_nan_molla/status/1184586622236610561 …
yep it happens with a lot of idols. it just depends on how your family has been doing it for years maybe? it has many other spellings. like even with hoseok from bts, his name by bighit is jung hoseok but some places have it as jeong hoseok, eg, when they went for the un speech!
If you have time, you can watch and listen to this. BTS last year got invited to give speech at UN about their #LOVEMYSELF campaignhttps://twitter.com/HamsYusuf/status/1184219784004673539?s=19 …
to the whole concept and touches on topics and ideas used in bts’s album and speeches (particularly namjoon’s un speech links well to this book). so no, reading one does not exclude reading the other. the new one is an introduction to the old one
bro i told my mom stuff about bts and now she wants to watch joon's un speech im so HAPPY
This part from the UN speech speaks to me on the deepest level pic.twitter.com/FuAhfp6xMu
I still believe, even though it’s unbelievable: To lose your path Is the way to find that path - Lost And the entire speech given by RM at the UN, I listen to atleast once in a day, although every bts song is inspirational the lyrics above resonates to me more
do you guys remember where you were at when bts gave their speech at the un
the way i have to write a 5,000 word senior thesis paper and i’m writing about bts and their UN speech .... i stay winning! stan bts and love yourself! pic.twitter.com/izLjOgmp6b
The Whole UN Speech #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/uct9OYkBpb
And the of RM's speech at the UN made me more motivated "Tell me your story.' I want to hear your voice. I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself.
Yeahh...thats why I always say "once namjoon open his mouth be prepared to get inspired by the words that came out of it". I still cry like crazy with his UN speech everytime I watched it
The way ARMYS comment under ppl just mentioning they like a @BTS_twt we really are the best PR. There's music recommendations, thank yous, the UN speech, etc
Song wise: Not Today and Anpanman BTS quotes: The entirety of Namjoon's UN speech is my motto nowadays
MONO of RM and his UN speech

Thank you for being understanding!

@BTS_twt UN speech
bts have 3 #1 albums, riaa certified singles and albums, un ambassadors who gave a speech at the un, bbma top group, recording academy members, etc. and kpoppies are getting brave thinking their favs are anywhere near bts because their favs got a #1 album due to bundles? gtfo
let's talk about BTS' UN speech that ACTUALLY saved lives of alot of people me included LOVE YOURSELF @BTS_twt showed me i have reasons i should love myself #stopbullyingpic.twitter.com/qlsdH8zIJ5
But I Stan again 1 year ago cause of them. And only BTS. I often find my fav song by BTS. But after watching UN speech by RM I Just curious about this group. the fact why I love this group cause they so creative. So inspiring,The melody, lyric story so touching. made them special
Dear Namjoon: Your inspirational & heartfelt speech at UN on behalf of UNICEF campaign n 9/18 was how I discovered @BTS_twt It’s been a magical journey everyday since & my renewed belief n hope 4 our future started w ur spoken words 2 the I’m proud 2 b ARMY OT7 4 life
they didn't do the music for numbers or hitting the charts they just want to spread positive messages in this world. if u don't know then just listen RM UN speech might be you understand them but i think it didn't work for you
this is highly unprofessional; bts and namjoon’s UN speech have no correlation to this + you used the wrong group in one of the clips. so disrespectful to sulli, please delete.
Im sorry but I lost it when they put the bts UN speech
The presentation is about someone who inspires you so I chose joon. It’s only a 5-7 min presentation so I’ll talk about his role being the leader in bts. The message behind their music and I’ll also talk to about mono. Their partners with UNICEF and his speech in the UN
i was at work, waiting in the cashier and i watch bts UN speech for the first time. i cried. fat tears rolling down my eyes and suddenly a customer came and i had to act like i wasnt crying =)))))
actually after telling her more abt their history, she was even more interested. not an army(she says hahahaha) but a definite supporter of the boys. And then this is her during bts' un speech https://twitter.com/mrsjeonjoy/status/1183002859060645889?s=09 …
someone tried to clown bts’ un speech/involvement by calling in class today by saying “oh they must be a political world society actor then” in a most sarcastic way possible and i was just like university....zzz
listened to namjoons UN speech n am crying again i love bts so much

About their positive influence to the society i showed him BTS VIDEOS UN SPEECH.. actually this all started bcoz i kept on telling how i wanted to go to BTS CONCERT SO BADLY and my DAD said he would accompany me My MOM too I'm in tears MY DAD IS THE BEST He is proud of me
Tonight, Epiphany, Suga audition clip, Taejin fight, Jk heel accident, Bts award winning clips, Watching how people loved chicken noodle soup Promise, rm un speech
I actually don't know how I'd be going today if I didn't come across with their UN Speech. It's almost a year ago when it happened. I'm forever grateful to have you on my radar. I always wish you a very healthy and happy life ahead, @BTS_twt.
not to flex but bts outsells international artists, held a speech in front of the UN, got a Grammy nomination last year and remain in the charts for months. if that doesn't radiate biggest boyband in the world energy, then idk what does
Anyways!! I'm really happy right now and I know the React was back in 17 so I hope @nailogical and @simplybenlogica had more opportunities to get to know BTS (THEIR UN SPEECH!!!) bc I think they share a lot of the same values (and humor) and love for cats
I couldn’t agree more! The UN speech is probably one of my all time favourite speeches.
ult questions !!! 1. BTS 2. Yes. 6. 3. Jimin/namjoon 4. No 5. Don’t leave me 6. Suga cypher 2 7. Tomorrow 8. You nice keep going. But also the UN speech 9. Namjoon 10. I wanna be smart and tall 11. Spring day 12. DNA drop an emoji for the questions
my irl bestfriend (doesn't stan bts) had spanish with me today and she said she saw one of the members' speech and I automatically said 'Namjoon's UN speech?' And she said yes and that it's really inspirational and put her hand by her heart. IN CONCLUSION. Namjoon is loved by all
Their UN speech !!! Nothing can ever beat that!! @BTS_twt #BTSPAVEDTHEWAYpic.twitter.com/WVy8j77Zep

I liked the song u r refering to. But u r kinda degrading kpop. Bts is not a just kpop band. They are legends to sell out many albums,stadiums,arenas etc and made a speech at the UN which shows they are inspiring for others. They made a lot of achivements and great works.
Bts' first win, first daesang, presenting award at grammys, un speech, first stadium sold outs #BTSPavedTheWay
UN Speech *chefs kiss* #BTSPAVEDTHEWAY @BTS_twt
Remember this UN speech? It was the first time I ever know them. I was really curious. I thought, why would a boyband from South Korea speak in front of world leaders? First one to do this in our generation. Only @BTS_twt ever did. #BTSPAVEDTHEWAYpic.twitter.com/av6rOdWFMU
Since is our independence day, our president should make a speech... He already did that at the UN. Or we should have a national anthem... They have written it for years(2! 3!) So, the uneducated ones in the back, listen to them! #BTSPAVEDTHEWAY #ArmyIndependenceDay @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/0xH8oSl2cY
Nobody does it like BTS. sold out stadium tours, multiple RIAA certifications, UN speech, 4 BBMAs, on the Recording Academy, breaking records, Artist of the Year 3 years in a row, etc. Most importantly they taught millions to love themselves #BTSPavedTheWay @BTS_twt
Remember when Joon won hearts by giving that wonderful speech at the UN? #BTSPavedTheWay @BTS_twt
I can't imagine if Jin interrupted RM for BTS speech at the UN spoke about his "Worldwide Handsome" because he only knew these two English' words... pic.twitter.com/ZRxdw881BB
remember when people said bts only had one minute for their speech at the UN but they ended up taking 6
I would say lots of nsfw things because he is daddy af but as it’s for school - obviously he as a person, he as a leader of BTS, how much power he actually has and how well he handles it, UN speech, the lyrics of his songs and all of the layers and meanings, his thoughts, —-
BTS really be makin me cry over here, the UN speech hits different https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo_mo5vA7tw …
@KitoAbashi I know you have requests for the BTS UN speech but this one I feel is also important The Love Myself Campaign https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo_mo5vA7tw …
WHAT THE FUCK WHEN LITERALLY 90% OF DESI AND WESTERN SONGS THESE DAYS ARE ABOUT LUST AND SEX AND DRUGS AND BTS ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD MESSAGE show her the UN speech and tell her why they're so influential and loved. I'm sorry she's being like this
student 2, 45 yo: "i don't know bts members.... but i love rm, i cried when i heard his speech at the UN. i felt like i could forgive myself for my mistakes now. i felt free. he's my favorite!" also "the most handsome member was born here!!! it's jungkook!"
im telling yalls my mom is captivated by anything namjoon says. this vid is her commenting on how good he is for like a min during his UN speech and a few seconds of her saying how handsome jin is hajshsjsksksjj If my mom says jin is handsome, thats it #namjoon #bts @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/luT5gJ13pD
Bc of xenophobia and they didn't sing in English they got ignored and even after their win BBMAs we got ignored and ppl thought BTS is just a 1 time thing. Let's be honest after Citifield and UN speech that's when ppl took them seriously and saw them as artists
lmfao hunny please keep your mouth shut if you’re not informed. BTS is all about spreading their voice and speaking up. go give their UN speech a listen to educate yourself
I didn't find any word to descirbed how meaningfull this tour for me. BTS just proved their speech in UN. "No matter who u r, where u from..." this is really hit me so hard. Thank you so much
the un speech nj made came from him. he stands for the lgbt and women. do you think that he and the other members wanted to raise money for the ksa government? this is beyond bts and literally about politics between ksa and sk.
This concert will follow you and be a stain on your UNICEF campaign and UN speech. Hypocrites.
bts went there to see fans and do a concert? nothing else? the UN speech is something they all stand by..
show them namjoons UN speech and any bts song
If BTS isn’t trying to save the world they shouldn’t promote it that they are. ‘Next generation leaders, UNICEF campaign, UN speech’. Actions speak louder than words.
omg so my therapist asked me what kind of music i listened to and i said bts so she told me also listens to kpop and occasionally bts. she even asked me about their un speech and that it’s amazing that they can be role models to me and other people
Ain’t nothing sad. Literally Korean politicians, businesspeople, professors, and the GP themselves always talking about BTS music, message, UN speech AND their #1. There’s articles written about it constantly. Y’all projecting your personal opinions on other people lmao
Or let's take the easiest part. Go to UN and give a speech on how we need Namkanda.
My 10 year old cousin just ask me is Kim Namjoon a President of a country (he asked this bc he watched the UN speech of RM) My answer: absolutely YESSSS #BTS #ARMYNation @BTS_twt
"No matter your gender identity, skin color, race or where you're from, just speak yourself." - RM, UN Speech. BTS went to Saudi Arabia to keep their words. They ain't gonna ignore a whole SA Army just cuz they live in SA. I love BTS like crazyyy
I wonder if kpop artists were all to speak about it what they would say about the hong kong protests many are Chinese but many also believe in Justice as far as I know I'm sure bts would speak out for hong kong considering rap mons speech at the UN
They? Do you mean the United Nations where BTS made an anti violence speech? Because 'they' also recognize the truth about Saudi Arabia. In fact, the whole world knows. #BTSDontGohttps://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/saudi-arabia …
Don't say things like that every Army deserves to see them! The government is the government&has nothing to do with BTS&fans!Just be happy for the fans that's all!Kpoppies are already on their way and we shouldn't be like that!Just think of their UN speech!No matter who your are!

Hai Lynette, u should really showed ur friends BTS idol performance on Jimmy Fallon. I know many armys become army after watching bts on fallon. They sang LIVE, great song, great lyrics not cringey insane choreo and the interview, fallon asked abt the UN speech. @BTS_twt

Somethings fishy with the media.. few hours after @BTS_twt depart korea for SA they started to repost NAMJOON UN speech. They be planning something fishy I can tell. Bookmark this twt yall!
Mr. 'I me, myself' Monster has been a problematic and dictatorial person since debut. And his UN speech reflected how much of a dictator he is, all about himself erasing the voices of people younger to him. He couldn't talk in plural. He couldn't let the youngest speak himself.
the UN speech was probably the first time I cried because of BTS: I remember getting home from a rough day at school and rushed to open my phone to see the livestream before the surge of emotions translated into tears when Namjoon didn’t fail to include us #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS
Don’t get me wrong. These are tough questions. But one of the reasons why #BTS is so popular is that they were/are vocal about societal issues through their songs, multiple donations, UN speech, etc.
I love seven of them. But my ultimate bias is Kim Namjoon. He is smart, dedicated and a great role model in my life. And when he sppech at UN last year the speech really gave a big impact in my life. I don't know if I didn't see BTS, maybe im lost. #TokopediaxBTS #TokopediaSaja

and FYI, alot of armys discovered bts not bec of kpop but thru some other avenues like the UN speech etc thus the diverse ages, backgrounds, races etc that u see in concerts. entire families go and see the boys and not just some hormonal teens
I wrote lyrics with English translations below the Hangul for Magic Shop this song has helped me at some of my lowest points. I also added a quote from Namjoon’s UN speech at the bottom since it also means a lot to me. #방탄때문에_한글배웠다 #한글날 #HangulDay @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/XMIRquvOdV
My lollipop moment was when I watched namjoon gave speech at UN. Thank you @BTS_twt to make me learning how to love myself
@SaturnLunacy #NameSaturnsMoons I think one of Saturn’s moons should be named Joon after Kim Namjoon from @BTS_twt ! He has a song called Moonchild, and often uses the stars as a metaphor for our lives (his UN speech). A moon should definitely be named after him!
One of my assignments just mentioned the UN. I got a little emotional thinking of @BTS_twt ‘s speech
i watching bts UN speech again i know long time an go but still it shook me an bit it make think at i should love myself you know truthful thankful that i know my name i know what i am as person
I'm not petty. But if I was, I'd reply to every single anti/ignorant local/troll post mocking/insulting BTS with the UN speech. EVERY. EFFING. SINGLE. ONE. (...let them choke on THAT.)
i was trykgn to find the transcript for joons un speech but i forgot rhe fucking word for transcript and it was urgent so i googled fucking "bts un speech lyrics" goodbye
Have you watched the bts UN speech?
So one of my non-army friend came across with BTS UN speech video and she told me that she really like that guy who was giving the speech among the seven. I told her his name was Kim Namjoon.
Kalo liat dia speech di UN sih ‘hallo my name is Kim Nam Joon also known as RM the leader of the group BTS’
I was deciding that I truly wanted to find myself and be myself and one night I was really thinking about this and out of nowhere a bts interview popped up, I watched it,I enjoyed it then I watched th UN speech and I felt overwhelmed with emotions and it felt right
“maybe i made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me” un speech quote x rm’s trip wallpapers @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Ar6i8PeTLf
@BTS_twt's Citifield concert was a life-changing experience. The power of BTS performance, so soon after the UN #LoveYourselfSpeakYourself speech, lit up ARMYs' hearts in that Magic Shop as if we all truly were the stars in the Milky Way. An amazing night #PCAs #TheConcertTour
if us armys never marketed bts as sjw it wouldn’t backfire so hard. the fandom initiated the woke image and bighit played along when they let bts go to nyc for un speech. and now bts are shouldering all the blame when they have never been prepared to live up to such expectations.
Not at how i was sick last night and put bts on the tv to feel better and my mum came and sat with me and i told her about the un speech and she was so supriswd and asked who can speak english and i told her whoa my bias- and for once she didnt mock me wow

If you're talking about BTS (JHope is a member of the crew), they actually made a speech in UN for their Love Yourself UNICEF campaign. They've also been selling out stadiums in US & other countries & broke many records. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
The fact that he quoted joons UN speech, my heart.
I watched #KimNamjoon when giving speech at UN meeting about Speak YourSelf. I am very inspired by his confidence And seeing his giggle , makes me even adores him more It's just another side of #KimNamjoon to be loved @BTS_twt
had a dream about meeting namjoon last night and i told him that his speech at the un meant so much to me and how much i loved bts and their music and he said thank you and asked what my name was and i told him and he said "thank u thia" and held my hands and i woke up sad
the few weeks bts spent in nyc for the un speech the newark love yourself shows the citi field show and the jimmy fallon show were the best of times
are doing this for the money?? we all know bts are genuine in everything they do this cannot be questioned but if someone plays joons un speech n hears that they went to perform in ksa on the gov request ... then what will we do.
Not keep quiet and follow along like puppets. They were so woke in the beginning of their career & now they seem oblivious to what is actually going on. How one action can have such an impact. Just look at the impact of RM’s UN speech. So no, it’s not JUST another country.
I wish all the energy spent on Demi Lovato was the same for BTS, especially considering they have a UNICEF campaign and did a speech at the UN... alas, fans are willfully blind to their hypocrisy.
Best UN speech in history
I love @BTS_twt for everything From their music to Namjoon’s UN speech pic.twitter.com/A2DkQiaSsw
And got selected. There he trained for 3 years. With him the journey of @BTS_twt started. In 24 Sept,2018, RM delivered a speech in UN from BTS. There he shared his life's experience,how songs inspired him to not to give up. That's why kim Namjoon is an inspiration to armies+
An Indian Instagram page with 5.3 million followers posted RM's UN speech yesterday. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/JUqdZwtNGN
mum’s BTS bias is KIM NAMJOON she said his speech at the UN was “inspirational”
Did I love BTS & listened to their song because of BTS themselves? Nope. It was because of Namjoon. I watched tons of his interview, his answer always intrigued me. When I finished watched his UN speech, I decided to try listened to them. Their lyrics and music is something else
I can watch this UN speech over and over and never get tired of it! Kim Namjoon for President! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/1bf6FgwxSR
Namjoon influenced so much with his UN speech. Even non-kpop fans. Seeing the BTS’ members appreciate each other everyday for what they do truly shows they aren’t an ordinary big band. Their relationship together shows who they are as people. pic.twitter.com/oFeG4YB3dK
Remember when joon wasn't sure if he could complete a task in run bts and seokjin asked him if he delivered a speech at the UN or not? And now he's praising joon's acting, when I tell you seokjin always makes sure namjoon feels confident in himself pic.twitter.com/OlllDYq9ed
And of course, I got to end with the UN General Assembly speech #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Have you ever sit alone and think about BTS's UN speech? Like I was alone then 'What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? Tell me your story' come across my mind
The media is SO QUICK to jump on any news which is even abit capable of painting bts in a bad, against-their-message-of-peace-and-humanity, against the un speech, way doesnt mattet if the source is even reliable or not….
I can't decide so I'm enlisting you, UN speech excluded, what is your favorite RM speech? I really like this one: #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/o1JrnvWwI40 pic.twitter.com/oDUMqyZDA4
everyone says that bts dont help me academically hah- shut up i litteraly turned in my term paper proposal for my history 002 class and my proffesor gave me a 20/20 and my references are books bts referenced, their unicef projects, and UN speech
I did it to myself, I know... my dumbass thought it would be okay to rewatch joon’s UN speech cause I miss you @BTS_twt and wanted a little inspiration.. AND NOW I CANT STOP CRYINGG pic.twitter.com/9ARs8X4F4B
bts’ un speech was on gordo y la flaca omg i missed it by a hair
Allthough I don't know everything about his way of expressing himself, I've heard many speeches by Namjoon while watching award shows and watched his UN speech, and this entire quote just seems off. I do not believe that any member of BTS would just randomly go "yeah, we're best"
the qt in the screenshot you tweeted wasn't in regard to the SA issue. overall i never interpreted BTS' involvement w/ UNICEF or Joon's speech at the UN as sign or indication that they were going to be vocal abt all humanitarian issues. it's a huge burden on them, they're not+
What were you doing when Namjoon and BTS gave their UN speech pic.twitter.com/pxwZpDnsHV
UNICEF Campaign Love Yourself #EndViolence encouraging young people all over the world to love yourself and importantly as RM said in his speech at the UN Speak Themselves to get help. BTS also donated all money from official merchandise from the LY tour, 3% of the LY album
todays starting off really shitty but im listening to ur UN speech!! so i think itll get better
.... #THR could had talk about RM's UN #LOVE_YOURSELFcampaign speech and the influence the guys' message has on their "crazy frenzy fandom"...who multiplies charities by hundreds across the planet. Name another fandom who's mobilised like this? #UN #bts_twt
Then i played superstar bts and heard namjoon's un speech and heard waste it on me AND mono and it all came spiralling down from there
UNICEF Campaign Love Yourself #EndViolence encouraging young people all over the world to love yourself and importantly as RM said in his speech at the UN Speak Themselves to get help. BTS also donated all money from official merchandise from the LY tour, 3% of the LY album
If one tweet constitutes a tantrum, then are you having a meltdown over me speaking myself? Like what BTS encourages? Especially after their UN speech? You're more than welcome to go away and have a nice day, like what I suggested earlier.
Tragic. Nothing abt @BTS_twt' MUSIC, message, UN speech, Love Yourself campaign, their humble beginnings & wot it took to get here & the amazing connection they have w/ their fans. His summary: 7 robots frm a silver spooned factory that got lucky. Se/th, do u know "dirty spoon"?
bts UN speech pic.twitter.com/0nprWhgdz8
Guess moron reporter didn’t watch any of the remarkable documentary vids on YT created by talented members of ARMY like xCeleste’s “BTS Contribution to Music”. Even 57yo me learned more abt BTS n less than a day after watching remarkable UN speech than this “pro” did b4 interview
BTS gave a speech at the UN.
Seriously. The UNICEF project and the UN speech.. those were huge issues on big topics. This article had to have been straight up lies. Where is this from?
Mixing politics and art is complicated but bts chose to do that , if they didn't want to get into this shit then they should've chosen another path from the beginning, you cant just have a message, give a UN speech and then pretend that all your care about is the music
oh i KNOW these reporters don’t know shit about bts, bts are some of the most politically/socially outspoken artists they have a whole ass UN speech plus multiple songs??????? what rm were they talking about cause this definitely not namjoon pic.twitter.com/GwMTr4u01E
I had the whole class watch Namjoon's UN speech because I just know they have to see it... @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/bYgX6QNzDM
namjoon saying that bts don’t speak about “big world issues like peace and war, poverty and starvation” but then giving a speech and the UN and having multiple politically charged songs since day 1?? i just don’t get it :(
Remember when Namjoon gave a speech at the UN? The humblest, most beautiful soul in the world. Your quote doesn't sound like him at all... pic.twitter.com/k8Om9jfAIl
now i really wish bts would confirm this....how would n*mjoon actually say that after the un speech n everything it's just so hard to believe + their partnership w unicef like no way?
so now they’re trying to make us believe that Namjoon said he didn’t care about World Problems when they went to the Un for their unicef speech??? boy we are bts’ clowns not yours
@BTS_twt u know how big a deal the UN speech was and what it meant, and the positive influence that came from it. performing for mbs has its own connotations that I think you shouldn’t ignore... pic.twitter.com/SkGKKzOj7v
Same! No one in my fam/circle of friends was into Kdrama, Kmusic & Kfood so there was no awareness. I got drawn into @BTS_twt via the UN speech. Now here I am self-learning Hangul, supporting #BTS, consuming their content, eating Kfood, & visiting Seoul in Dec. #TheGroup #PCAs
this will help me to love myself even more BTS made me a better person and I am very thankful to them bec they compose a lot songs that heals everyone of us. I also remember of what RM said in the UN Speech that "No matter who you are, where you from, your gender identity and +++
I was wearing my speak yourself bracelet today and my tutor asked what it was for so I had to explain who bts was and then namjoon's UN speech and it honestly feels like a fever dream???
i just sent my intro to sociology teacher an email about bts unicef partnership and the un speech
My cousin in El Salvador is also a @BTS_twt fan and she made me this awesome Wings concept inspired painting piece with an iconic verse from RM’s UN speech. My Army heartt #BTS #BTSARMY #RMpic.twitter.com/7TSRmmkFb3
Genuine question: how is it possible for anyone to be a “casual fan” of @BTS_twt ? Like, how could you have seen any performance, or any episode of Run or BV, or Namjoon’s UN speech and not want to give them your heart and your soul and all your money too?? #TheGroup #BTS #PCAspic.twitter.com/1VRMau9SDB
How do I include Namjoons un speech in any of these? Or anything bts related? pic.twitter.com/K14ptqaKfL
1 OF MY FRNDS WHO DIDNT LIKE BTS SAID SHE SAW NAMJOONS UN SPEECH. SHE SAID IT WAS AMAZING AND HIS ACCENT WAS SO GOOD!!
This clip is everything. When Uhgood played showing each BTS members and RM's UN speech, I felt immense emotions. "BTS has become artists performing in big stadiums and selling out albums right now but I'm still that ordinary 24 yr old guy." #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/oMrCr4sNEz
My family: We hear @BTS_twt did a speech in the UN, is amazing, tell us what kind of people are they? Me: ... well... #NoRegretshttps://twitter.com/laintrepida/status/1178665278273536000 …
This reminds me of Namjoon’s UN speech when he said that music was his sanctuary. The fact that his mom realized his dream early and supported him is touching. She gave him that needed push to start his music @BTS_twt #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS pic.twitter.com/kNC29qogSj
"The global pop group taking over the world" "Most popular band in the world" "First kpop group on AMA's" "First kpop group on Ellen show, Jimmy, and Corden" "First kpop group to give a speech at UN assembly" And The Kpop Boy Group who became famous ALL OVER THE WORLD?!@BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/RGLLwmuh3W

i seriously think this is such an important thing to address, especially since their unicef campaign and UN speech was such a point of pride for ARMY and BTS, and would love for them to stay true to their values!
Hahahaa I'm slowly turning mine to one, he doesn't like to hear other languages, even Hindi so I edited out a whole mv with a Malayalam song, and send to him he said he loved it,then I send UN speech. atleast I'll make him to a casual fan for sure. that IQ thing is a catch
"*insert whole namjoon's un speech*"
Namjoons un speech on my back
I miss this day so much. The UN speech had been that week. AH. I love you, thank you for being in my life @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ENh2bpVMyy
Is it just me or is time passing by weirdly? I mean BTS were at the UN over a year ago already! I don't know if its just me but I feel like they were there and gave that amazing speech just last month and wings was released in 2016...its almost 2020 but it feels like so long ago
Today for church I drove a nursery volunteer home. She asked what i was listening to it was LY:Answer. She asked about the group she remembered I saw @BTS_twt in May. I played RM's UN speech for her. She was so enamored & impressed she wanted to know if she can watch them on YT
namjoons UN speech on my forehead
Army is the biggest PR of BTS..... We need to understand our worth... We are here for BTS only.... No clouts to anyone.... Remember RM said we are fascinating during billboard....he said "we have the best fans in the world in his UN speech".. Now idc if someone call us toxic pic.twitter.com/M2RsR5Wmt4
Today I was folding laundry and one of my BTS shirts stood out. It had RM’s message from his UN speech. This week has not been easy for ARMY. There have been legitimate questions of cultural appropriation raised.
please watch this sir BTS gave a speech in un https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
Sir with all due respect do you have specific stan base encounters which anti-blackness have occurred? Any receipts? There are lots of fanbases in kpop but not all are the same. BTS ARMY are as socially aware as BTS like how they addressed that at their UN speech.
I get it, some people know kpop beause of other idol not bts. Even myself, I used to listen to bigB, wonder girls, psy. So don’t tell me they did help BTS cracking west certainly not enough of one to get BTS on BBMAs, AMAs, numerous collabs, chance to present a Grammy, UN speech
they’re the first artist to be invited to hold a speech at the UN. If you google “BTS UN” u’ll find the speech easily.
Bts un speech in front of presidents of all nations: "and our fans have become a major part of this campaign. WE TRULY HAVE THE BEST FANS IN THE WORLD"
We went on Pride Parade in Lublin, Poland to support LGBTQ+ with RM's message from UN speech. Love is love and we'll keep up the fight to love OURSELVES! Thank you BTS! @BTS_twt #BTSLoveMyself #ENDviolence #LoveIsLove #LGBTQ #MarszRówności #Lublinpic.twitter.com/Ym0PQLBkVe
Many people called him selfish after his UN speech but no one saw how much he gave his effort to make them all shine and no one saw how proud the rest of bts were. No one remembers how bts exists because of him before coming at him for literally everything+
The weird moment when whole nation is praising imran khan for UN speech and I'm just like Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
True but there’s also Kim Namjoon’s UN speech that inspires me everyday and I couldn’t even imagine my life without BTS
Guess who watched bts' un speech again and I crying her eyes out
my parents were talking about the UN and so i said bts gave a speech at the UN last year and my dad gave me a look to shut the fvck up and he looked so bothered by it my dad has something against bts and idk what it is but it’s annoying and it’s honestly pissing me off
I also love how their collabs echoes the UN Speech to speak yourself, at the same time pays tribute to those that inspire them to be what they are today. Music is indeed universal!Thank you #JHOPExBeckyG @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt's speech at the UN will go down in the history books. President Namjoon's inspiring story have helped me through some tough times. Love yourself. Speak yourself. No greater words have been spoken into existence. #My1stARMYversary #haruharuhaiku https://twitter.com/haruharuhazel/status/1177228440430243841?s=19 …pic.twitter.com/auQmXUsmUM
they're acting like namjoon didnt talk about gender identity in his un speech, bts making bt21 gender neutral, yoongi saying gender didnt matter (I forget the exact wording) to him in a relationship, etc etc etc
Be true for other idols, other koreans and others in that upbringing but its BTS! theyve proved time and time again that they don't discriminate by openly showing support and encouragement towards oppressed minorites- their UN speech, their music and words theyve said
Not hobi or bts related but I just heard a guy at work saying that bolsonaro’s speech at the UN was “perfect” oh my fucking god I feel sick.
Nico! Watching your reaction to RM's UN speech... cant wait for your #JHOPE #CNS reaction! #CNSOutNow #JHOPExBeckyG #ChickenNoodleSoup #CNSisComing @BTS_twt
Extremely significant to someone else. Just saying 'get over it' is not a solution. We need to talk about this problem. Thinking about RM's UN speech made realise that BTS helped me the courage to seek help and talk about my problems. I'm not there yet but I'm on my way. So +
also my speech teacher read the title of mine to the whole class (theres one person in my class who listens to bts) and and she said “kim namsna John?” and we both went , then my class proceeded to say Kim Jong Un

So. My father who know nothing about bts (except the few things I told him about them) and don't even speak english watched namjoon's speech at the UN with engsub on his own initiative
I'm 15 and my little sister is 10 and we both like BTS. I mean she was watching RM's UN speech and seriously started crying

I got it! “Yesterday’s me is still me. Today I am who I am with all my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser and that will be me too.” - Kim Namjoon in BTS’ UN Speech
1 year ago the presence of BTS in the UNICEF speech at the UN which was giving a message to all people everywhere, it was an honor for BTS and happy to be able to attend the UNICEF speech at the UN ... and we (ARMY)… https://www.instagram.com/p/B23LCdopsr8/?igshid=1ud36kibvnxev …
Thank you so much! They are truly amazing. My eldest is a really bad perfectionist. So bad it kept her from even trying things for fear of failing. The UN speech helped her so much. She has come so far since then. I’m so proud. Now “Done is better than perfect” is her motto.
Such an amazing story and just a touch of what @BTS_twt does for us who need them. When my 8 yr old granddaughter was having a rough time we just put on the UN speech and her confidence and strength grew. This band has helped so many. Hugs to you and your son!!
BRING THE SOUL DOCU EP4 HAVE ME CRYING! They played namjoon UN speech and every member talked about how they cope with their stage persona and the real them :( they are so sincere and I just love BTS so much
As a mom I get really mad when ppl diss a generation that has had 2 face so many hardships. Worrying if their school days r safe. Bullying from all kinds of sources. Being told by society who they r etc. I’m ARMY bec RM’s UN speech told all ok 2 & speak 4 themselves @BTS_twt
Gah I forgot & I’m so late to celebrating Joon’s UN speech anniversary! Really a momentous event for all of us. I’m so proud of him #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs + @BTS_twt
remember when bts were talking about their un speech and yoongi said about us "just because they idol fans , they get belittled a lot. they are really incredible people. actually this is not something you can do just because you like someone" he appreciates us so much i love him pic.twitter.com/e42qqfrGMl
Joonie Namjoon gives inspiring and moving speeches. His UN speech is simply amazing among many others. Jungkook is so endearing and sweet. His adorable smiles and when he scrunches his nose I love how hardworking and caring they are. Laughs n giggles that spread happiness
My first song was Idol and I became full-time ARMY about 2 weeks before the UN speech. My first Comeback was Persona and my first concert was RoseBowl day 2 #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSUKUNITE/status/1176919012795723778 …

Something in 2013? Bts has shown rheir growth in 2018 with their speech against racism at the UN. Keep bts out your mouths and PLEASE come up with new drags
Did I just read from an army that bts should be nominated for a Grammy because of their un speech..??? Oh hunny that’s not how the Grammys work...
Looking his back during UN speech he looked so big... Rm u smart u loyal n i appreciate that @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/uruhiko_kpop/status/1176708273648652293 …

While RM make a speech in the UN, some armys degrade in monocelled. You apparently don't represent anything as an individual, so you scream about other people's merits and downplay others. The world did become better so far, there are people with this mindset.

I looked at her and replied: It seems that you are in favor of youth, so you should see the speech of the "Chinese" leader Namjoon of BTS at the UN, which by the way yesterday He turned 1 year giving it and was televised worldwide.
In the UN speech, @bts_twt Namjoon discusses music calling him and even though it was his passion, there were undeniably obstacles and hardships. Intro:Persona outright discusses the shadows, the flaws, and his self doubt.

one of his speeches made me stan BTS and his UN speech sort of made it concrete that I would continue supporting the boys because of their message and everything they represent

Namjoon's speech at the UN was amazing, BTS truly is the voice for the younger generation. What personally stood out for me was when Joon said in the past he stopped daydreaming to fit the moulds of others, and that is relatable to me #1YearSinceSpeakYourself #MyDreamMyVoice
Tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of RM's speech at the UN. This is why RM is such an amazing leader. As the other members praise him, he gives the credit back to them. This is why I'm so happy to see them with the success they have. @BTS_twt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qi9_lKCXUQ …

My lovely ARMYs, did you know that Jim Yong Kim, the President of the World Bank (also the first Asian-Am to head up an Ivy League College) who introduced @BTS_twt for the UN speech, has a lot in common with #RM? They both like sunglasses and they're both idols. pic.twitter.com/2SxCErkM6w
#RM is famous as #RM of BTS and the boy who gave the UN speech so if its visibility he already has that. As for interviews he is all over the place as BTS lead spokesperson and its not like in the interviews they have solely focused on the brilliance of MOTS as an album
I remember it really well, we were together and silent while listening to his words. We cried at the end because we were so touch by his words Today still I remember feeling so proud of him and BTS to be there, at the UN, for this important speech

Oh my god honestly exactly the same for me!! The first time I saw them was (coincidentally) on Joon’s birthday - by the time the UN rolled around I had fallen so hard and cried watching the speech. I’d barely leant their names and I was already so in love.
I still can’t believe that it’s been a year since BTS speech at the UN....it feels like it was yesterday and Namjoons words are still on my mind every damn day
the fact that joon’s UN speech is the reason i convinced people to give bts a try and they genuinely liked them for it i’m-
remember when we felt so much proud for our boys going to the UN and then we heard that beautiful speech of namjoon and we all started crying. that was such a wonderful day for bts and army
Tbh all these tweets about Namjoon's UN speech suddenly makes me want to go watch other speeches he did. He just has a way w/words that move ppl. He had worries about being a good leader for BTS which is understandable but he more than rose to the occasion. I'm so proud of him
I remember watching this at work on my computer. My manager walked in and asked what I was watching. I said, a UN speech. She was impressed and asked the others on my team why they weren't doing the same #1YearSinceSpeakYourself @bts_twt
i'm getting emotional again #1YearSinceSpeakYourself Namjoon's words inspired me so much that i quoted him in my very first speech where I did exactly that: speaking myself Namjoon's UN speech will forever be one of the proudest moments in my life as an army! thank you @BTS_twt
i dont know how to put it into words but. every time i think of joons un speech i just get this massive sense of pride? im always proud of him and bts but that speech is just on a whole new level

Something we can all be proud of, believe in, and live by! A beautiful speech to hear again in honor of today's convening of the UN. #BTS #방탄소년단 #loveyourself #speakyourselfhttps://twitter.com/JessicaJungxBgA/status/1176156561246318592 …
Namjoonah UN speech changed my life. It still inspires me. I am glad I found you and we crossed our paths like destiny. You gave me courage to fight with depression. Today I am who I am is all because of your’s and BTS’s inspiration @BTS_twt #1YearSinceSpeakYourself #RMpic.twitter.com/E3DRt2XOfN
TBH I always saw in her what he showed during the UN speech and he really is a big part of why I began to really fall for them as a group. But, I do think that it helped a lot of people see how amazing he is and what having a man like KN as the leader of BTS really means.
My first showcase in an exhibition (in collaboration with a designer friend) was inspired by @BTS_twt, MOTSP and the UN speech. They really inspired me to relearn myself and my creative side. #MyDreamMyVoice #1YearSinceSpeakYourselfpic.twitter.com/rC0JMpSHJi
It is rare, rather less possible, to see a K-Pop group to stand in front of world leaders in a UN event, but for @BTS_twt ? They made it. Today marks 1 year since RM gave a very inspiring speech about self-love & self-acceptance at the United Nation. #1YearSinceSpeakYourselfpic.twitter.com/vTNkGVu1vE
with today being one year of the UN speech i can’t find enough words that can show how proud i am of bts. i listened to it again and it moved me to literal tears. kim namjoon kim seokjin min yoongi jung hoseok park jimin kim taehyung jeon jungkook i am so proud of you we all are
Remember when Namjoon was complaining that he can't do something on BTS Run and Jin was just like "Did you give a speech at the UN or not?"
Time to post this epic UN speech...This will always make me proud as an ARMY #1YearSinceSpeakYourself #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt — pic.twitter.com/8gDvrY1t48
Great speech from the most famous K pop group BTS in UN
remember when #WhatIsYourName was trending a year ago bc of bts's un speech and everyone opened up about who we are as ppl and what we've been trough bc that was so goddamn beautiful
A year ago, I watched the livestream broadcast of their UN speech. Other people are talking about very serious issues, but they told their own stories. I feel nervous for them then but now I'm very proud. #1YearSinceSpeakYourself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/hecRJKEERr
Still remember I walked into the office w the brightest smile & proudest face the next day, then realized most of my colleagues watched the UN speech since the video was widely spread. I was like ”YEAH! THAT’S MY BTS” @BTS_twt #1YearSinceSpeakYourself #1yearofRMsUNspeech
The courage and talent of this young man. idc if you think his speech was boring, or cliched or whatever, the fact that he spoke clearly and bravely in the spotlight at the UN in a language not his own is more than 90% of us are capable of doing. #BTS #namjoon @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1176175753949589505 …
It's been one year since you deliverd your beautiful and powerful speech. Thank you Namjoon. Thank you @BTS_twt

@BTS_twt's positive impact is remarkable. Too often it's tragic historical events that stick in our memories. In contrast, #BTS UN speech shines in our memories like the North Star, guiding us to build better a world. #1YearSinceSpeakYourself #ENDviolencehttps://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg

"I want to hear your voice...

. @BTS_twt inspiring speech at the UN will go down in history. Thank you Namjoon for delivering it so beautifully & the members who had his back and supported him through it. This one of a million reasons to why BTS is different. #1YearSinceSpeakYourselfpic.twitter.com/89tKTZxhuF

Well, accepting yourself is not easy at all. With the flaws & failures. With the negative sides of yourself. I'm still learning & still far from perfection to fully accept myself. But @BTS_twt helps me every single day, including their speech at the UN. #1YearSinceSpeakYourself

Awww. I can imagine. I was so impressed and stunned that a K-pop group was speaking at the UN about stuff like this. Hearing stories about how much he and BTS inspired and gave hope to armys, just with this speech, later on was so heartwarming and moving

anyways as a lesbian bts constantly making it clear they see lgbtq+ as equals and namjoon making the effort to include something about gender identity in his un speech, although a small gesture, means a lot and makes me feel good that i look up to people who would support me lol.

My best friends are getting married in one week. I still have to finish writing a speech, I'm feeling anxious! I wish I started writing it earlier but I've always been a procrastinator. Joon's hard work and confidence, particularly with the UN speech is my inspiration @BTS_twt
I actually have the UN speech pinned on my other account. It got a few people interested on Facebook.
Same. And just do it. I wouldnt recommend fancams cuz those can get annoying and arent always relevant, but links to songs and lyrics or even the UN Speech work if they fit the conversation.
So you should've kept your opinion of the gay flag to yourself then sis Namjoon said gay rights at the UN Speech and if you don't like it then delete your reply pic.twitter.com/FFFASiA4u0
Jimin DOES support gays?? All of them do, you need to listen to Namjoon's UN speech again pic.twitter.com/FFFASiA4u0
Someone asked me.Why u love BTS?watch RM speech at UN.Those music says a lot.RM and Suga spitting those bars is tongue technology indeed.And the humble beginnings.That speech I can relate
the song idol and the UN speech #TheGroup #BTS #PCAs @BTS_twt
they don't really care lmao the only time we've spoken about them was when they saw bts' speech at the UN on facebook and were impressed when i told them that namjoon taught himself how to speak english
Just another reason why he deserves the whole world ... they just don’t make ‘em like this anymore I mean, UNICEF campaign, UN speech, RM forest and now this... his impact is incredible pic.twitter.com/pUFz3VgQzk
Reminds me of a non-army friend I showed her the UN speech by Namjoon she listened to the speech we discussed how amazing it was She rewatched it as there was someone who took her attention it was Jin she repeated the video followed BTS on twitter for Jin, she's in love with him
i'm not from america, but UN Speech was the main reason i become ARMY #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/notsweetbtstea/status/1175262399198310400 …
The UN Speech forced people to look at BTS differently. A superficial pop group with nothing to say do NOT become UNICEF ambassadors and do NOT attend the UN. Let alone have a member give a thought-provoking speech. At this point, BTS exited the Bubble Gum Wall. pic.twitter.com/0Fsf0OCZV7
But here's what's interesting: A series of catalysts helped BTS to escape this most basic level of popularity in America. The most important, in my mind, was the UN Speech. pic.twitter.com/xgCZc3MDS5
Today, I felt a very familiar feeling. My heart is breaking again, because of my insecurity. But I don't know why every time I feel like this, @BTS_twt comes in a perfect timing as always. I was crying, then I saw their UNICEF SPEECH in UN in my nf #LoveYourselfSpeakYourself
In case u are sad or tired with life (I hope u aren't) .. Then here is joon's UN speech to motivate u towards life and yourself ND if really feel down. Please tryna talk to someone Be happy Think positive LOVE YOURSELF SPEAK YOURSELF @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/9AQJnriLJS
IMAGINE IF THIS IS AN OFFICIAL BTS ALBUM TRACKLIST: SEA DREAM GLOW A BRAND NEW DAY ALL NIGHT SKIT: RM'S UN SPEECH PROMISE SCENERY TONIGHT DECALCOMINE DDAENG
thinking about when my mom saw bts wearing suits in UN speech day and was like “finally they look like normal humans” SKDJDHDJSJD
GUESS WHO GAVE A SPEECH AT THE UN? KIM NAMJOON, LEADER OF WORLDWIDE SENSATION BTS
One day when I decided I truly wanted to find&be myself after yrs of trying to be like others&someone I’m not, a bts interview popped up in my YT recommend for the first time&I clicked it fell for them and then I watched the UN speech & I felt a lot of emotions & here I am
ABC News Anchor Kendis Gibson disrespecting and insulting BTS: "Use to sing in a voice, spreading their legs like this" ??? And also humiliate abt Namjoon speech on UN abt the "Speak Yourself" thingy. Kept repeating that sentence in such a rude tones pic.twitter.com/loInH2Pa5B
yoU CANT PUT UHGOOD AS A BGM WHILE BTS CLIPS PLAY AND TRANSITIONS TO RM’S UN SPEECH U CANT
I can't stand her shes such an attention seeker, and her face makes me uncomfortable no offence... She keeps making videos about bts, buying concert tickets and then she's like "idk their music is manufactured, repetitive and mediocre" she also criticized namjoons UN speech
It is pretty clear that RJ just allowed BTS to give their speech in the UN coz of another schedule
the moment i told my little brother that bts gave the UN speech, he's stunned. he was like, "wait UN? as in United Nations??" it makes me feel proud that i stan bts
performing in front of 60k people in a foreign country, have the best selling album in 2019 to date, break the record of the best selling korean album of all time in a digital era, the UN speech, cultural merit medal, and many more...
This is my first time hearing @BTS_twt #RM #NAMJOON UN speech and I would be lying if I say it didn't bring tears to my eyes. I couldn't have been more proud! https://twitter.com/RMPICS_twt/status/1174643138906005504 …
I watched #BTS on @jimmyfallon He mentioned UN Speech! I clicked On YouTube and Dived Into BTS and K-culture! @BTS_twt
No one did. I stumbled upon BTS UN speech by accident and fell into the hole. I did this to myself
Guys I wrote paper 3 English and included BTS UN speech on my motivational speech and I did a dialogue where my mom didn't like the music I listened to
So we're celebrating one year anniversary of BTS' UN speech on 24th September Jimin's birthday 13th October and army independence day on 14th October
#RMisPerfect @BTS_twt @bts_bighit #BTS #RM #Namjoon The UN speech is still one of the most amazing speeches I have ever heard from such a young man. He spoke so well. And so eloquently. I cried. I really did. He is indeed a leader. I him so much. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/RMSQ94/status/1174862388815912960 …
My topic for monday is about Public speaking and Delivering speech. So I use RM speech in UN for my motivation because my student are really into KPOP and it's connected to my lesson. And also I love BTS so much. @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/wer4GbVnDS
So many ways that RM has inspires me. He boost up my confident level and makes me love myself. He is my daily motivation in life. His speech during UN, his end ment of wanting us to use him and BTS to love ourselves more.. this man deserve more love and also my #RMisPerfectpic.twitter.com/ScJQwYG5OR
he never had heart surgery, he literally clarified what the lyric that spread that rumour meant in his UN speech. idk why you’d say this under a cute edit to begin with,,,
so there's a potential of me going to the un for my global studies class and i just wanna ask.......WHY COULDNT BTS HAVE GONE THIS YR I COULD HAVE SEEN NAMJOON GIVE HIS SPEECH IN PERSON DEAR GODS
When you think about it, around this time last year, BTS was so busy. They had their concert tour, UN speech, appearances on various shows, filming for Bring The Soul etc. Yet, I really wonder where did Namjoon find the time to record mono...did he already made the tracks way
I just wanted to share how i came to know BTS- i was casually scrolling through YouTube recommendations and came across that UN speech of RM my instinct told me to click on it and when i did I couldn't explain how many mixed vibes i felt , like if +
After the UN speech, many ppl lined up too.
I love how I am analyzing Namjoon’s UN speech for my Public Speaking class.... This is amazingggg, I keep on including BTS to my school work.... @BTS_twt
nothing more, nothing less. but namjoon’s speech at UN and BTS as ambassadors of Unicef is so powerful. even my mom was extremely proud when she watched this, and told me “your generation are so lucky to have them as your voice because back then we dont have any advocate.” https://twitter.com/RMPICS_twt/status/1174643138906005504 …
They say we are disrespectful because we clearly say abt BTS's success but I've always think this way: isn't it disrespectful if we say it's all about K-pop? Not kpop has the best selling album this year so far, not kpop gave a speech at the UN assembly...
If you haven’t heard the speech that Namjoon gave at the UN, you really need to. He’s so thoughtful. He has a real way with words. #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/RMPICS_twt/status/1174643138906005504 …
Lmao... worst of worst joke ever.... One will reject UN speech and Gammy award presenting just for ......... what? Nothing Someday they will start to say - they wanted to keep their name BTS but they just keep it down. pic.twitter.com/WlISmwF93P
DAAAAAMN it's been a year? I remember the day we found out he was going to make a speech at the UN and we were all nervous for him :( I'm rlly about to cry wow
My 55 year old politics teacher is a bts stan, our homework for next week is to watch namjoon's UN speech. The only politics homework I will ever do.
Their speech in UN is still tweet pinned in their official account that means
totally gives me goosebumps!! joon’s un speech ft. uhgood and bts’ concert clips damn #PCAs #TheConcertTour #LoveYourselfSpeakYourself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/zhOgWZU1NL
hate the fans but never the artists who jus wants to spread self-love n all tht "u might not be fine for now, but itll pass so dw" lyrics tht they wrote n produced out of all the shite they got pls listen to their UN speech as UNICEF's goodwill ambassadors pic.twitter.com/F0WPq5sK92
Episode 4 of #BRINGTHESOUL_DOCUSERIES was absolutely beautiful! Love the incorporation of RMs speech from the UN @BTS_twt
...it's literally just a video of how koreans play the original game. also sry, but no, we promote them in a positive way, linking their #endviolence campaign & UN Speech, even linking our donation projects & all, but even w tht? locals will still say "lol no way" all bc its bts.
joon’s UN speech being exactly a month after I got into bts and the fact that I teared up watching it really shows how quickly they came into my life and I connected with them, time doesn’t feel real, that seemed like so much longer than only a month after I found them
For my Human Communications class I have this project to do and part of it is to write a paragraph about a speech. I was going to do BTS speech at UN but it’s not 10 minutes long
Just finished Ep 3 & 4 of Bring The Soul . The UN speech still makes me cry like a proud mom. On a lighter note, I kept checking my phone every time I heard the kakao chat go off @BTS_twt
namjoon's speech at the un was & still is so influential for a lot of people, im glad bts could share their message to the world in such an important place pic.twitter.com/5i2p6hcfRc
On Sep 24 at midnight KST, we will celebrate the UN General Assembly Anniversary!

Thank you for staying respectful, that is shockingly rare. These men have met the president, have books about surviving mental illness, huge philanthropists, and even gave a speech at the UN! Even if you aren't a fan, these are respectable young men.

i just finished watching the last episode of bring the soul, it's so emotional once again, namjoon writing mono :( the un speech, jihope and their thoughts on joon and the future of bts :(
BTS UN speech on Spotify.
so i got interviewed for like a book thing today randomly and the lady took pics of me and my sis with the pc in the back of our phones. and i talked about how kpop has helped me and how bts has shown me a different way of life. and i talked about joons UN speech
Okay so I'm late but ep 4 of the docuseries broke me... like the shots of centeal park and seeing bts in the places I hang out... and the UN speech and then uhgood playing at the end... I'm in tears.
I think I've cried watching every single episode of the @BTS_twt's docu-series. How dare they put Joon's UN speech and uhgood together #PCAs #TheConcertTour #LoveYourselfSpeakYourself
just finished watching bring the soul ep. 4 & wow i’m so emotional bc i went to chi d2 & citi field :( that ep. was beautiful with mono dropping & namjoon’s un speech. & with all the clips & video of citi field :( i was so extremely happy i miss bts sm

oh so calling bts mediocre and accusing them of plagiarising other popular music is an opinion? insulting joon’s un speech is an opinion?? you’re so far up her ass you cant even see that’s literally anti behaviour that’s not an opinion
The way I’m so not excited for my birthday next tuesday but then I remember last year BTS made history. Namjoon gave the UN speech and that was such a glorious moment
Realized my favorite prof is gone ,,, because cgs profs only stay for a year round but I’ll never forget how she showed bts’s un speech as one of the main concepts when it comes to critical gender studies, especially among many other prominent sexuality, gender and race figures
Cultural impact: █ █ █ █ ____ BTS UN speech Any other speech
I just saw this and I'm broken?? Namjoon's UN speech whilst bts concert is playing along w uh good as bgm. That's all I ever needed @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/OWfa256AuU
Episode 4 of @BTS_twt #BRINGTHESOUL_DOCUSERIES was one of my favorites! The storytelling, messages, and editing was amazing! I especially love seeing the finishing touches of Mono & the behind the scenes of the UN speech.
stop talking to me as if i was a koreaboo and accusing bts of plagiarism, calling them colorist and mocking namjoon’s un speech is not an opinion its literally spreading hate
I just finished watching ep 4 of #BRINGTHESOUL_DOCUSERIES! I still get teary-eyed whenever I hear the UN Assembly speech The boys said so many self-reflective things episode: their influence, dark sides, pressure & expectations from everyone. I love this docu-series! @BTS_twt

i finally got watch the bts ep.4 they really put namjoon’s un speech with uhgood playing in the bg all over citi field clips im so sad
This episode of bring the soul is just wow @BTS_twt My fav so far. The UN speech. Uhgood at the end. Suga & his designer furnishing dilemma. Every single scene. Jungkook talking about being so young & accomplished. Mono's release. Jihope scene in the car. Tae's jackets
Thank you RM for sharing your moments with us, can't express can't explain it, just too beautiful Your UN speech your songs all your other moments I want to be totally lost stuck and repeats in it, i it, good night RM take good care yourself I love you
I watched BTS docu ser. ep 4. “Uhgood” is my favorite song on Mono Playlist & the UN speech continues to beautifully haunt me to this day. Thank you for giving my thoughts and emotions a safe place to call “home”. Thank you @BTS_twt Borahae #BTSxARMY #MonoPlaylist #Influencepic.twitter.com/nVwIN1zb80
she thinks shes an army but shes a whole ass anti saying shit like jin doesnt know how to sing and calling bts colorists for putting on sunscreen and basically called namjoon a hypocrite for his UN speech.
RRRRRRR!!!!MMMMM!!!!! RM RM RM I get so excited every time I hear even little bit of your UN speech I can't explain why but that moment was just so special it's like a once in a lifetime moment for that moment, and all other moments too and your mono songs..I
It's not like bts are UNICEF ambassadors, gave a speech at the UN last year, our fandom makes donations in their names to help the environment and they were named this generation's leaders by TIME magazine... but go off I guess https://twitter.com/MikeAdamOnAir/status/1173600537767567360 …
Kim Namjoon when he made his UN speech,saw Hobi dancing with a mask in an old video, Jimin in Danger, Taehyung in Singularity, Jk in Euphoria, I heard Jin Epiphany which made me cry, I melt over Yoongi dancing in Seesaw. #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
Next week week will be UN speech anniversary, and the day after day will be my anniversary of knowing bts and Namjoon
The way my body just got goosebumps when they ended today's episode of Bring the Soul, with Namjoon's UN speech!! Oof! Yess! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nFlOwiMJDY
Just watched the fourth episode of Bring the Soul that covers the time of the UN speech. #PCAs #TheConcertTour #LoveYourselfSpeakYourself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Fm5MMxr9gM
and bts came in that speech quite a few times and when ever they showed up on the screen everyone would start clapping lmaooo,i really wished they showed their un speech but it's okayy atleast people know that bts are un ambassadors
The 4th DocuSeries is on Weverse. Its the UN speech day. I will cry. They were so regal and humble and of course #Namjoon #RM did phenomenal. @BTS_twt @bts_bighit #BTS #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv #BTS @BTS_twt
i just finished this weeks weverse and i cant stop crying how dare YOU put uhgood over namjoons un speech @bts_bighit
the only thing I'm gonna celebrate on the 24th is it's the day BTS attended the UN and gave an amazing speech THAT'S IT. NOTHING ELSE.
The Bring the Soul episode of this week left me submerged in a sea of mixed emotions and thoughts...and the audacity to end it with the UN SPEECH... I'M- #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/BoU26qGyol
How DARE they put joon’s un speech overtop uhgood while playing clips of BTS at citi field... how DARE they make me cry like that
Wow today’s episode - the ending montage with Uhgood playing in the background and joon’s voiceover UN speech.. gave me goosebumps literally.. @BTS_twt
I just remembered how I was minding my own business when my granny walked up to me and asked me "who's the good looking English guy at BTS?" I said it was Joon and when I asked her how she knew bout him she said "I saw their speech at the UN, it was beautiful." Gran

Ep4 brought back memories of day I discovered @BTS_twt by watching their UN speech. That day chged my perspective on life, my faith n next gen & left me needing 2 know more. Sad times, tough decisions, feeling alone, BTS reminded me it was ok 2 just try 2 do my best & Im impt 2 pic.twitter.com/3gRw3Q86vB
Just watched today's Bring The Soul episode and I cried what's new haha seriously Joonie came to this world to bring all these fuzzy warm feelings and super deep thoughts to my life. Ah thank you forever leader @BTS_twt I'm still as proud as day 1 since the UN speech
The UN speech over Uhgood? I went through some emotions tonight. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt
There was a lot of emotion packed into this one. Laying the UN speech over Uhgood really got me. I'm going to have to watch it several times.
Same.. once I heard the UN speech I was gone..
This episode had such a meaningful feel. That UN speech will go down in history! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/weverseofficial/status/1173765067931672576 …

BTSoul episode 4 made me cry like a baby, and that ending with Namjoon's UN speech + uhgood + them having fun on stage... that really went deep to my heart. If anyone asks if its possible to love @BTS_twt more and more as days passing by, the answer is yes

Of all that I’ve endured, this episode hit differently. The UN speech, MONO, and the first stadium concert are all reminders of 2018. 2018 was an up and down year. This episode brought back hard memories yet reminded me why I love @BTS_twt so much.. #BRINGTHESOUL_DOCUSERIESpic.twitter.com/avGwCV2gvH
As soon as I heard the first word of the UN speech I started crying and I didn't stop the whole ep. @BTS_twt are so insanely strong. And the trust they have... I admire them more with every day. And doesn't the docu series really delve into some Jungian themes?
Namjoon's UN speech AND Citi Field content, which was my first @BTS_twt concert made me . And just the overall content of the episode in general. Oh, guys, I love you all so much. #BRINGTHESOUL_DOCUSERIESpic.twitter.com/dhkbRT2u65

The UN speech I’m so proud of them @BTS_twt #BTS #방탄소년단 #TheGroup #PCAs
I looked them up for the first time on Jins Birthday I dont remember the first song, tbh, but I found them via the UN Speech!
Here’s @BTS_twt’s speech at the UN just because ~ #TheConcertTour #LoveYourselfSpeakYourself #PCAshttps://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
namjoon's speeches, music, his everyday diction, etc. it ALWAYS inspires me. he is my life coach. he helped me be confident. now im crying because ive been given the opportunity to visit the UN and give a speech. just like him :( namjoon, thank you. @bts_twt
yo so bror and minh play bts world, august watched a bunch of their interviews and namjoons un speech and emily is starting to listen to some of their music. bts' impact man.
@BTS_twt can you make your UN speech into a skit in your albums pls just cut them up and put them into the different versions or one part per comeback
Can't wait namjoon your speech at the un helped me thank you bts I can't wait to see more I'm proud of all of you keep up the hard work #fighting #ARMY #BTS #EXCUESME
idk if I’ve said this on here before but fun fact joon’s UN speech was what motivated me to apply for the major I truly wanted to pursue which was psychology; before, I was going to apply to business/smth practical to appease my parents so I’m forever grateful to bts for that
1. bts's UN speech
This shows theyve only read bare minimum abt bts. Yoongi mentioned his ideal type is not limited to girls. Also said he’d prefer if bt21 characters didn’t have specific gender. RM used gender identity in his un speech. Taehyung watching movies & suggesting songs frm lgbt+ artists
Listening to BTS while writing about Joon's UN speech is probably the best thing I've ever done as an army in high school

UNBOTHERD QUEEN .. omg my dumb classmates are the same i tried EVERYTHING from mvs to lyrics to the un speech they don t wanna change their irrelevent opinions about bts
Y: Cause I think everytime I know Indonesian ppl learning korean, they also said that they love bts, and I think that's great M: so you know them? Y: yeah of course! What they did is amazing tho, I saw their speech at UN and I really like the message Me: *soo soo proud! *
If ANYONE comes for bts,,, a pic of the UN speech,,, period
happy happy happy birthday namjooniee!! thank you for being the greatest leader to bangtan. thank you for leading, protecting and taking care to BTS. i still remember you UN speech, i love it and i want to send my gratitude to you, for telling me to love myself..
Remember when namjoon was doubting himself and jin was all like “who the fuck gave a speech at the un conference?” And bts did not understand the sudden outburst but namjoons spirit was successfully lifted up? They’re married
i :( how can you not especially after the UN and Artist of the Year speech last year >:(((( #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/jiminiesbear/status/1172853408333815808 …
Do u ever just think of how our boys were hated and not recognized at all since debut &had no hope, but now they're members the recording academy, are "the biggest boyband in the world" and "princes of pop", had a speech at UN, and CRY?? #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
my mom told that bts “tan guapos” in the UN speech pic.twitter.com/X8TabxSW42
they're really these icons of diversity, telling the world how important the voice of the youth is in changing this hellish patriarchal society that worships white people. namjoon's UN speech says it all. my army ego is so big rn. stanning bts is one of my best decisions EVER.
BTS supports gay ppl, they support all gender identities, look up their un speech, look up the lyrics to their music and some of their interviews. After that remove hobi from your Otherwise it would be very hypocritical of you.
i think part of the reason why my mom lets me stan BTS without commenting on it is that she's heard their UN speech before :( she always had smth to say when I stan an artist before
SHOWING MY MUM THE UN SPEECH AND ALL SHE KEEPS REPEATING IS “so powerful” IM GONNA START FLYINGJRK I CANT DEAL ,,,WHEN I SAY THIS HOUSEHOLD IS GONNA BE A BTS ONLY HOUSEHOLD

What a lovely thread Tamara, 27, physiotherapist. I stan BTS since Namjoon UN speech (thats the firts video of BTS Ive seen). I've fallen into this chaotic stan world for Jooni and stayed for OT7
Something memorable to me about BTS is when they were at UN, like I couldn't have been more proud to be an army because of how far they've come to have reached where are now. The speech Namjoon gave was heart warming and inspirational. pic.twitter.com/2FrmuRGE0u
I was so nervous and excited that day, and I felt very proud of them, it really was an important day. It'll be a speech we'll never forget. Once again thank you very much for that opportunity to speak to the young people. #UNGA
But just think....in 30 years hopefully Namjoon's UN speech and BTS' messages can be in every school textbook teaching the young ones the way of loving themselves.
BTS' UN speech!!! Sobrang nakaka inspire kasi he's encouraging us not to give up kahit na marami tayong faults and fails and to speak for ourselves. It somehow made me feel motivated to be better and always give my best shot. #BTSfortheWYNhttps://twitter.com/wynmarquez/status/1172341540733063170 …
My most memorable BTS moment is Namjoon's UN speech because of his powerful words, I've learned to fully love myself & accept who i really am. #BTSForTheWyn
our moon child, i hope you have the greatest birthday. you’ve done so much in your life already, the un speech, impacting people’s lives, and being such a great leader. happy birthday namjoon.

The UN speech led me to BTS. Though I was in a good place (mentally & emotionally) then, I know that self-love is nurtured constantly. Their music & message help a lot-Namjoon’s lyrics especially. He is impressive & inspirational- my primus inter pares! My first among equals!
My speech at the UN would be about parents, grandparents & foster parents taking part in being more involved in kids lives. For a positive life outcome & happiness. It's more than making sure they eat & sleep or get educated. Kids voices need to be heard.
Wow!!! These are such beautiful words sister! You could rock this speech at the UN! pic.twitter.com/vSyB1lPAK9
#PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt There are so many memorable moments tbh.When I became an army, when they win their first daesang,when they won bbmas for first time, when they won the group award bbmas this year also when they gave speech at the UN
I need ideas for a website name for a site about BTS It is going to have 6 articles about BTS including one about the UN speech, how they are changing kpop, how music is a universal language, etc. & I'm going to have products AKA some albums. But idk what to call the site :/
Joonie along with the rest of BTS gave a speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/cx5khgUGhY
I still get goosebumps whenever I watch Namjoon's speech on UN assembly. What a historical moment! @BTS_twt #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
This amazing speech by @BTS_twt at UN love yourself speak yourself https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1171897813942317057 …
I was not an army then & I didn’t even know your real name you were just RM of BTS Then one fine day I found a video on Yt titled 'BTS UN Speech' tbh I was shocked at first I was like why would they give a speech at the UN I mean how is it even related to music??
OP: Hobi always finds RM's effort. That explains why Hobi tabs RM's shoulder after UN speech to cheer, takes over his mic even though they are now interviewing, record a moment of RM working hard. Hobi is always there for him. #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/bullet_proofly/status/1172160049340268546 …
I just wanted to tell that my English teacher deserves rights just bcz he told our whole class to watch Namjoon's UN speech as an example on how speeches are done. And he also said he loves the speech and BTS. (he is still boring though...) https://twitter.com/ddaengifyuagree/status/1171864276455157760 …
Danger remember what jk told after his UN speech, "he is a dangerous man" #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
Last but not least i want to drop this inspiring video that will never get old The reasons i know bts is because of this video and namjoon speech at UN, he is so inspiring. I hope he always remember that I'm very thankful for his presence now. pic.twitter.com/1J0POXbQYf

Again happy birthday light of my life, the leader of all leaders. You inspire me so much. When I saw you at MetLife I took all of your words to heart n even in your UN speech, all of your words touch me in many ways. They’ve helped me through many things and they’ve also helped-
I agree. Last year I gifted a handwritten to my friend and included a part Namjoon's UN speech in it. Few days back she came to me & said that it was a really precious gift & that she reads it often.
my mom used to dislike the fact that im into Kpop particularly BTS but when he heard you UN speech it was like an eye opener that you guys are more than just pretty faces. #MoonchildDay #HappyBirthdayNamjoon #HappyNamuDay #OurJooniverse @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/zLLD1cjQQn
We were talking about identity in my class so after that I showed my teacher Nam’s speech. She loved it and then she shared it with the classroom next dayIm so happy Namu Nam es un súper héroe @BTS_twt #NamjoonBirthday #LetrasparaNam #JOONIEVERSE #namjoonday #NamuJoonpic.twitter.com/U88FzViYMt
I remember my dad coming home from the work shop (he's a woodworker) bragging Namjoon's UN speech to me like I haven't heard it before him. He usually put on a music while working but that time he worked while listening to NJ's wonderful speech.
no one asked but im gonna be watching Namjoon's UN speech all over again all day and all night long #HappyBirthdayNamjoon #OurMoonchildRM #HappyBirthdayRM @BTS_twt
Bringing back this iconic UN speech of President Namjoon. I remember how I felt so proud for them at the same time how I was lucky to stan the group. #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/ddaengifyuagree/status/1171864276455157760 …
Sometimes I think we are more woke that these people who PRETEND to be more woke and intellectual. I mean BTS gave speech at UN and are on the cover of TIME MAGAZINE. Top 5 artists on Spotify India. Are they really unaware about BTS?

What I love about namjoon is hard to say in words I love his passion, resilience, determination, how caring he is and his personality too. He's someone I look up to and admire very much. He has also taught me so much in loving myself and inspired me through his UN speech +
Btw, we were born just 1 day apart My bday is 3/21. I fell down the @BTS_twt wormhole after watching Namjoon’s UN speech in 9/18 so almost 1 yr ago. ARMY is awesome at helping ea other so just ask. Grt bk that helped me was http://a.co/dNRdnMM Welcome 2 Bangtan Universe
This is so beautiful!! Love Sasha's UN speech quote and Victor's writing is so cute!!
I love how locals are delving beyond the "korean boy group with funky hair colors" narrative and actually taking their time to pay attention to BTS' message & music. And we got Namjoon's UN speech to thank for that. Our president of Purple Galaxy
nam nam, enjoy your birthday! I rewatched some of the speech you gave at the UN. I’m beyond proud, you inspire me everyday. I keep a picture of you on my chemistry notes to remind myself to keep going. Thanks :) @BTS_twt
That’s why bts is always getting invited to events here and was invited to do a speech for UN..? Alright whatever you say
+ @bts_twt i still struggle to live sometimes. to be happy. to be unashamedly me. but your speech at the UN conference for @UNICEF and @bts_love_myself has stuck with me since that day. i'm overwhelmed each time i listen to your words (and i all but know your speech by heart now)
Yesterday's me is still me. Of course the UN speech... That one was what got me into BTS. That speech alone turned my life around
That he likes Sicko Mode by Travis Scott and that he was a whole ass genius with an IQ of 148. I guess I just really vibed w him then. But what really changed me was listening to his UN Speech. Prior to stanning BTS, I did suffer with a lot of social anxiety+
Namjoons amazing UN speech should be used in schools and colleges all over the world. Such an inspiring, heartfelt speech from the most genuine, wise young man in the world. Whenever I feel down or anxious, I always think of this and it always helps. #BTS @BTS_twt #OurJooniversepic.twitter.com/SWwjBAKXPb
Me too. I got curious what creds these boys have to be speaking before the UN. So I checked out the speech, then their MVs, the translations, RUN BTS, etc. Been Army since (1 yr this end Sept). Joon is young but has the wisdom of ages. Impressive & inspirational! #HappyBirthdayRM
To the MAN who gave us a meaningful and motivational speech during UN. #HappyBirthdayNamjoon #OurJooniverse #MoonchildDay @BTS_twt
One day in your speech you gave at the UN you said that "when you were a child you used to imagine that you were a superhero that saved the world." Well, this may have been just a very distant dream at first, but that you did ... You, KIM NAMJOON.

By measuring the favorable response to S. KOREA simply because of BTS' positive reach around the world! The UN speech can be use as a measuring stick and the End Violence campaign can be used also; worldwide positive impact is Koreas' gain and that's how it would be measured Imo!

Last year, I was chosen to be the MC of an event that happens every year in my college. I was a fresh new student and even though I like to speak in public, I was so nervous that I could barely breathe. This happened a few days after @BTS_twt gave that amazing speech at UN.
I still remember crying over Namjoons speech at UN. You inspired many to be themselves. KIM NAMJOON, YOUR EXISTENCE IS PRECIOUS TO THIS WORLD. AND I'M GLAD THIS PLANET HAS YOU. @BTS_twt
Were really impressed and praised the boys. I showed them Namjoon's UN Speech as well. Beside it i also supported elder person with buying the food for the whole week and going di the same for 2 more persons. Also since i know how much BTS members are supporting children+

Happy birthday to Kim Namjoon, genius IQ of 148. Rapper, singer, producer, writer and soon to be author. That UN speech he gave on loving ourselves impacted so many people and we love him for it. Arguably the reason we have BTS rn and so many amazing songs. #HappyBirthdayNamjoonpic.twitter.com/ywYvMfDQNf

When he went to UN and gave us a really nice and motivated speech. His wise words he spoke to everyone. And at MetLife he also gave us a speech. Those speeches really helped army’s out including myself. I really don’t know what I would do without bts.
You: accuse BTS of plagiarism, disrespect joons iconic UN speech, Stan BTS for their looks Also you: army’s weirdos defending their faves jobless weirdos Make it make sens
"Moonchild you shine When moon rise, it's your time" ALSO HIS UN Speech and "Please use me, please use BTS to love yourself"
Speech nya dia di UN bermakna banget buat seluruh generasi muda di dunia ini :) "No matter who are, where you from, your skin colour, your gender identity. Just speak yourself" @BTS_twt #PCAs #BTS #TheGroup HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our Presiden KIM NAMJOON pic.twitter.com/LB3DftO5C8

I’m reading them all but i just can’t reply to them all because then it would take me longer. Also, I’ve noticed a lot of you mentioned the UN speech and how some found BTS because of that. That makes me proud. https://twitter.com/Softfor_Tae/status/1165044763436957696 …
shes called namjoons UN speech hypocritical, said bts were colorist for wearing sunscreen, accused them of plagiarizing songs which were actually sampled songs, shes racist etc.
bro bts aren't even partners with the un they say one speech for them and y'all act like they're politicians for every country and can stop a crisis
bts have also said a speech at the un, spreading awareness on self love and speaking yourself as an individual pic.twitter.com/43XdTIDMSh
Namjoon said in his speech to the UN "I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, little by little.” Strong words by a smart man!! @BTS_twt #WorldSuicidePreventionDay
im trying to be nice as possible but honestly you shit on bts so much but still brag about going to their concert like wtf how can you say stuff like namjoon's un speech was fake and jin deserves no lines . I understand if you were calling them out for something they did but they
Happy birthday Namjoon #PCAs #BoyWithLuv #TheMusicVideo @BTS_twt I think all those moments are beautiful, but these are some of the best. RM speech at the UN. When he plays the leader. Terus waktu dia jalan². Waktu dia nyanyi & nge rap. Lnjut di foto :) pic.twitter.com/WHDDK1UpoJ
Dear Namjoon, My name is Shawndra. I'm a new fan to BTS and am still playing catch up to everyone else. However, I feel as though the seven of you have already changed me for the better. As you stated in your UN speech, at age 25, I think it's time I started to love myself. +
Happy bday namjoon !! of course the UN speech is going the be the best moment of namjoon Speech yg mungkin udah ngebantu thousands of people out there to love and speak themselves #PCAs #BoyWithLuv #TheMusicvideo @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KxDqqRnfN2

Epic army moments that made my heartrate spike & I felt our global unity - Namjoon UN speech - @BTS_twt winning Top Group in the BBMAs - #BoyWithLuv rising as top viewed mv in 24 hrs while army in diff time zones took turns streaming What's yours? #PCAs #TheMusicVideo
One of my students presented BTS as her inspiration today . She was talking about how they changed her life and i was trying so hard not to tear up and scream “same girl!” at her and freak her out She also played RM’s speech at the UN !
not @how ellie got to watch bts concert videos & joon’s UN speech in class meanwhile i gotta learn about contentious politics,,,
Saying "im a fan of BTS why would i hate them" Then there's she saying Namjoon is hypocrite and saying dumb things abt his UN speech. She's clueless abt music yet claiming that the boys plagiariz*d other art. Does she even know the whole sampling term exist?
Finally had a #BTS Day with my mom, a brand new ARMY. We watched some MVs, Colbert, the docu-series, the UN speech, Nobodies to Legends & some Run eps. No full concerts yet, but next time for sure. A few hours in, I asked if she had a favorite yet. #TheGroup @BTS_twt #PCAspic.twitter.com/Hoh1dIKWQF
Woah no way I was the same that UN Speech changed everything for me last year
Kim Namjoon is reason I’m ARMY 2day. His speech at UN on behalf of UNICEF #EndViolence #LoveYourself campaign was my 1st exposure 2 @BTS_twt I just couldn’t believe my eyes, ears & heart that this amazing young man existed & then I learned there were 6 more #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS

Tbh everyday is memorable and the happiest for me..but I'd say when they attended the UN and gave speech! #PCAs #BoyWithLuv #TheMusicVideo @BTS_twt
Happiest birthday to Namjoon. You were the first member who caught my attention because of your different looks and your intellectual speech at the UN.Your talks are the ones that inspire me, your lines are the ones that motivates me.LolNoWorries AtleastThisEarthHasNamjoon
so my teacher asked what’s a leader to you, and she called on people to answer and she called on me. I talked about someone whose open minded and uses their influence to spread positivity & etc. I said Namjoon was an example and quoted his UN speech and she loved it ty @BTS_twt
Definitely! He totally emanates the leader aura and self-confidence required for a leader, without being egotistical. RM is such an eloquent speaker. His UN speech is one of the best speeches I have heard. His sincerity and execution are inspirational.
It was namjoon's UN speech which got me interested but it was this video of jimin that got me hooked....LOVE @BTS_twt

Watched this after RM's UN speech.. And I just want to say that after everything is said and done I'm just glad Kim Namjoon exists in this world, and I'm glad that BTS exists. Borahae @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/YqYlBeZEQak
BTS/BH put themselves on a political platform (hollow as it may be) since debut and as UN ambassadors who made that big speech about antivolence...well it's not the best look to go and raise money for Saudi. SJ was used in this same way but they've had a political image
Remind me back.... Thank you.. Love how Namjoon relax himself and the rest of BTS watch him endearingly.. Namjoon speech really the most iconic history of BTS career and it turn the whole interesting subject to BTS as youth ambassador at UN platform. #NamjoonBirthdayhttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …

Ya’ll should I email my teacher the link to Joons UN speech so we can watch it in class, everyone in my class doesn’t like Bts but I still wanna get the message that they aren’t bad people
I first found them because people I knew via social media loved them that’s actually what led me to watching the UN Speech and that’s when my #BTSARMY journey began last year #TheMusicVideo #PCAs #BoyWithLuv
she faked a whole ssng video, called b*s colorists, accused them of plagiarism, said that j*n has a bad voice and called tae an al*en, and made fun of namjoons UN speech. AND she uses b*s for clout. she's giving bts a bad name and targeting gullible ppl like u to believe her.
Any chance i can get to post namjoons UN speech under a h@te tweet about kpop/bts im taking
let BTS meet their own fandom isn't that what BTS and armys r standing for ! just remember that UN speech , race gender , nationality .. nothing of that can prevent us from standing together and speaking ourselves ! let saudi armys live ! STOP HATING ON THEM !
she criticized Namjoon un speech, jin's voice, said that their songs are “similar” to others accusing them of “plagiarism” she don’t know about samples?, she called them colorists for putting sunscreen? She doesn't give af abt bts and just profiting from them using their image...
how can you still support her when she criticized the un speech, jin's voice, said that their songs sound similar one to another, said that bts copied other groups, called them colorists. she doesn't give af abt bts shes only using them for clout how can you be so stupid
She accused BTS of copying other songs, she called them colorists and overrated, she said jin has a bad voice, she criticized the UN speech... how can y’all support her? She use BTS for clout, she don't love them.

Bts UN speech I was screaming through the entire speech NOT joking
Still hoping for Namjoon's speech at the UN to be included in the next album #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
I hope that Big Hit and BTS will see sense and make a stand. Otherwise their speech at the UN will start to mean very little.
the ignorance this fandom has is insane , they brag about bts achievements unicef campaign UN speech donations etc but they get silenced and ignorant when it comes to a concert that is sponsored by the gov for sa to have a better image to the world disgusting
Just realized it's almost been a year since RM gave his UN speech #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
Because she called bts colouri$t, bc she mocked joon's un speech, bc she faked a whole sasaeng thing? I have a list of sh¡t she did, if you want more lemme know
BTS can't speak english? sure! they didn't give a speech at the UN either! pic.twitter.com/KDwZsTfcwB

The fandom has always been loud about how woke BTS is, what’s with them talking about societal issues in their songs, or the UN speech, but now that they are performing in Saudi Arabia, and it can’t be dissociated from politics, you look the other way…

I think it’s funny because Namjoon straight up showed their support in his SPEECH AT THE MF UN! So, those fools who say they don’t support LGBTQ+ can just zip their mouths BTS has shown support in more than a few ways too smh
MY MOOT IS A BTS STAN I JUST FULFILLED MY ROLE AS AN ARMY AND SENT HER THEIR UN SPEECH AND BEST PERFORMANCES !!!!
Thinking about the day where BTS went to the UN general Assembly... The way the fandom seemed more nervous than the boys lmao & the moment Joon stepped out to deliver his amazing speech. I literally was shaking & crying. So proud of them #TheMusicVideo #BoyWithLuv #PCAs @BTS_twt
I showed my students joon's UN speech on the first day of school and got them to discuss what they liked about it. One girl said she liked the fact that bts are from a different country than her and for a 6 year old I'm so happy with that answer
When bts gave a speech at UN !! Everything they do makes us armies proud this ome was very special to me. Tysm @Dimplejoon4 @cryingOverhobi
so i had to talk about who inspired me in history and you know i did joon, so my teacher went like who did you pick and i said “kim namjoon from bts” and i told her bout the un speech and she said “wow they must be taking over the world with their message huh?” i went :D YES MAAM pic.twitter.com/YltU1PrJmd
the boys UN speech has literally become part of my morning routine @BTS_twt
hi i know you do so much for us and i appreciate you. everything you’ve done. mono has helped me be comforted. i watch your interviews in english and see how hard you try,, it gives me motivation. your UN speech. i have that on my wall. your quotes too. so many other things

I remember him making mention of it in his UN speech of how gender identity didn't matter when you're speaking yourself and I've always felt really validated from that. #BTS #TheGroup @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/shookyfan/status/1169013936693358593 …
https://www.wish.com/share/5692fzpiio … Namjoon’s speech at the UN speaks to me on a personal level. It’s what really drilled BTS into my soul, what got me hooked in the beginning. Rewatching it always makes me really happy. Everyone needs to see the words that he brought to life inside ARMY.
so i've told my old teacher about namjoon's un speech, she took my classes last year too and she loves my passion for bts and she said she is going to teach her class about the speech. and now apparently they are organizing an assembly for the speech so everyone can learn it!!!
Box office movies, their sold out stadiums tours, their concert attendance, their campaigns with UNICEF, their inspiring speech at the UN, and more! Bts happens one in a lifetime and all these achievements is the proof of that
im making my mum watch bts' UN speech ... doing gods work
안녕 Uwu 남준이씨님 I’m so glad you were able to just be 남준 and a normal 26 year old I want to tell you whenever I read or see your UN speech it just makes me feel so special like you’re talking directly to me and that’s my mistakes are okay보라해요사랑해요 @BTS_twt

I hope @BTS_twt has seen this story!

Twitter & my close friend did. I saw an article about Namjoon & BTS gave a speech at UN and I directly asked her which songs I should listen. She gave me ALL her favs, and here I am now, an Army
Using their UN speech or Armys good deeds is a great way to promote ...and even the psychological perspectives and namjooning But I prefer not to mention the name bts name directly https://twitter.com/shadow_twts/status/1160601400105213952 …
You could find ARMY explaing the meaning behind BTS’s music, talking about their UN speech and the love myself campain, the motivation in studying subject such as psychology and philosophy due to BTS lyrics or just spread some introductional thread: https://twitter.com/oneirataexia/status/1129009725214023680 …
Translation to English: The hastag that we're going to use the Nam's Birthday is #/JoonMiHeroe (JoonMyHero), because in the speech he gave at the UN he says he wants to be our hero and protect us from everything. I'm this in this moment: 'gif'. @BTS_twt
Namjoon:“I thought our peak would be at bst “ Now look at them after three years,the world biggest boy and,one of the top influencers,front cover of time magazine,over 20M followers,stadium concerts,UN speech,Artist of the year 3 years in a row, did I mention Bts paved the way ?
remember when the bts un speech came out. i was in my ap us history class and i wasn’t doing my work and i started tearing up and i may or may not have started crying at least my friend who sat next to me helped me stop crying before i really embarrassed myself HDBSKSK
— Day 1: When I got into bts’s music I started watching a lot of interviews and he always seemed so interesting and then I watched the UN speech and that’s when I fell in love with him
Definitely @BTS_twt. Just listen to their lyrics, what they say during vlives, Bangtan Bombs and especially the UN Speech. Who is doing it like them.
love how i’ve had the biggest crush on him since the un speech but didn’t get into bts until march... do y’all see the problem
bye i’m not even gonna entertain ur ass if u think bts just apologized bcuz ppl were hating on them. u are a fool if u think that. they literally have a whole campaign abt loving urself no matter ur differences and even namjoon brought up his prior mistakes in his UN speech
When I watched namjoon's UN video speech. I was blown away. He's such a good speaker. I think BTS is lucky to have him seriously. He's an important part in BTS. Please always be healthy and happy, Namjoonie. I admire u. pic.twitter.com/e25UM8TyhF
if ur dating a bts stan ur single to me. what are they gonna do?? quote namjoon's iconic un speech to me??
Dear @KEEMSTAR, Many Kpop accounts you want to ban support the speaker and the members of this talented boyband. We support their advocacies in partnership with @UNICEF #ENDViolence #BTSLoveMyself #SpeakYourself ~ @BTS_twt Speech at the UN: pic.twitter.com/mI2MGIG0Lr
Tell em how BTS albums Love Yourself is aligned with Unicef Campaign and that BTS were invited to UN to give a speech. Set BTS apart from the usual groups.

@WilliamShatner thanks for your kind words. It doesn't happen a lot;) Also BTS gave a speech at UN if you want to check; https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg It's really inspiring. Thank you. I love you
Stan BTS! If you’re interested then please look up their speech at the UN last year. They also joined up with UNICEF to help stop violence to children. Their music is amazing and about self love which has touched the hearts of millions worldwide. They truly are an inspiration.
The @WilliamShatner?? Sir, you won't regret searching @BTS_twt and ARMY up. Their UN speech is really inspiring. They can't solve all problems but they do make the world a little bit better for lots of people. And army try to spread their message and help in anyway we can https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1167857611342929920 …
Grew up watching Captain Kirk, #trekkie for life and #BTSArmy forevaeva!

Mr. Shatner, thank you for shedding light on our charity work!! @bts_twt Army is a fandom of all ages, languages & races across the world spreading a message of love and acceptance. We hope everyone lives long and prospers! May I recommend watching BTS' UN speech? pic.twitter.com/1WPO9VXep0
There are numerous projects all over the world that Army are doing to make the world a better place in Jungkooks name. I hope you do more research in the future maybe look into their campaign with #UNICEF to end violence or their UN speech
This photo really melts my heart bcoz you have proven to the whole world what leader-nim said in his UN speech. You guys are the best example on how people should treat each other equally no matter how different we are from each other. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/8zKv3zTnml
BTS actually does a lot to benefit the world. Here is a speech they did at the UN. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
overall he’s just so funny and clueless. So there. Anyways, in terms of answering your question, I think you should stan bts because they’re really inspirational, from encouraging young people to love themselves, their UN speech, their humbleness and respectful manner that they
Super fan??? My ARMY self is shaking.. Hindi Sila marunong mag-english?? Ooopppsss BTS is shaking esp. Namjoon is shaking, Un speech is shaking
in a few weeks its gonna be the anniversary of the day bts did a speech at the un how are we feeling
Amazing article.... RM's UN speech will always be the highlight of BTS moments in my life. We can see even through screen how genuine honest he was. He meant every single word he said.
Go with the flow. Live your life. Have fun. Do good for others(ie UN speech/motives etc). And please KEEP CREATING music and dance:)
That too! Like I knew of kpop as a thing, and even BTS indirectly through tumblr gifs since 2015, but I didn't know any music until Fake Love and became ARMY after the UN speech. Anyone bragging about being an OG kpopie isn't ARMY
a knee weighs i'm presenting bts' un speech in class today
Someone send this clout chaser the RM's UN speech and recent BTS Episode vids please~ I'm— https://twitter.com/leeunsangie/status/1167454019045883904 …
MY MOM SAID HARVEY DID AN AMAZING JOB DURING THE UN SPEECH SJSDSKSKSHS MOTHER WHOMST I wanna know her other thoughts on the bts yt videos she watched on her own time
My mom told me she watched bts youtube videos today like the UN speech and the Billboard awards and when i showed her the maknae line Polaroids i got today she asked if the jungkook photo i showed her was jimmy, taejoon or cookie SKSKSKSK
Mom and I were watching Youtube and she randomly put on BTS’s Love Yourself campaign video and then cried She said she’s going to show it and Namjoon’s UN Speech to her students
Not to forget, that BTS legit has an anti-bullying campaign! Joonie also reestablished in his UN speech that ethnicity, age or gender doesn't matter. If anything, ARMY should be a big supportive family always
I realized I was an ARMY when I watched their UN Speech and said to myself, it will not hurt to stan. They look genuinely nice. After getting to know them more, btch, they are the nicest people alive and sad that you can never be friends with them in real life. @BTS_twt
My site will be a BTS website where there are BTS albums available for sale and the articles are going to be ones relating to the UN speech, their success in the West, etc. I’m EXCITED!!!!
Are you talking about BTS RM SPEECH AT UN!!!
I just realized I could have actually seen BTS at the UN speech because of family connections
I WAS WATCHING BTS' UN SPEECH AGAIN AND OH MY GOD I AM SO PROUD OF THEM
That's so cool. But why did they not react to them having sold the Wembley out and having done a speech at the UN though? #MPN #ARMY #BTS #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/hopespiration/status/1166839278854377472 …
I’m rewatching the UN speech and crying... #HappyBirthdayToMe I guess I love you @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/hrgIPhKjPH
PIED PIPERS LYRIC AND I OPENED THE MSG AND IT WAS PIED PIPERS LYRICS(not full lyrics just a part) BUT THE THING IS THIS FRIEND DOESN'T LIKE BTS(she used to hate them before but toned down to dislike after I showed her the UN speech)IM SHOCKED I JUST HOPE IT AIN'T SUMNTHIN MEAN
everyone at the school I teach knows im a bts stan either cus they've seen my pc on my phone or cus they're in one of the classes where I used bts lyrics & joons un speech in social studies
i can't w/ some people saying bts doesn't have any impact. but y'all need to accept the fact that bts is written at the books of sk, achievements & namjoon's speech at un being studied by students. bts will never be forgotten. years from now, their legacy will still be told.
Hello!! Do you remember BTS RM(NamJoon)'s UN Speech? Joy and Colin did his speech shadowing and we learned a lot We are proud of him pic.twitter.com/vqqI6LLZrC
In the first place, everything we do is political. We are political animals. Politics is not just about the govt but us. From their debut, BTS is known in debunking societal pressures (No More Dream, NO, Bapsae, etc) They speak of about #SpeakYourself in their speech at the UN +
There was an ARMY in the comment section on Weverse, under the post Tae lately replied to, demanding BTS to answer her letters that she send to the bh headquarter bc in the BTS UN speech they've said they want to hear our stories and eye... I mean this shit is scary
my student, whom i tutor, used namjoon's UN speech as a context to explain an answer in his English test at school and got an A..... u see when u stan BTS
I just watched Namjoon’s UN speech bc I plan to use this message in a speech I am giving about BTS and I swear if I’m not allowed to play 30 seconds of this clip, I will cry
Show him RM's speech at the UN? Pretty soon his lock screen will be joon too. (my husband's bias is namjoon & he even has a koya t-shirt) good luck!!!!
namjoon :( and all of bts . they try not to use gendered pronouns and just the whole UN speech <3
I realised I was an army the moment I started crying during Namjoons speech at the UN. I felt understood from seven young men and actually heard the words in my head spoken out loud from their leader. Thank you @BTS_twt

my favorite memory of bts is seeing them attend the grammys, give a speech at the UN, break record after record and overall just their accomplishments
My friends and family know about my love for bts and some of my friends are actually Armys! Few of my colleagues too! My family understands and appreciates bts lyrics&their message.They loved joon's UN speech. And I am happy for that because they were baffled abt my love for bts.
I want bts to have their own tedx talk. Another serious one that allows them to express their intellectual abilities, because boy, did the UN speech blow me away
Do you what is call inspiration? Do you know what is call a Role Model? Do you know what call a proud moment? Do you know why we call him leader? @UNICEF thank you so much! RM's speech at UN is still an proud, emotional and excited moment for each and every army! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/perfectlyjimin/status/1165163185646665730 …
do u guys remember what u were doing the day bts went to the UN and namjoon made his speech?
Tip for your bored soul... Watch BTS winning top grp, MMA 2018 idol performance, their first daesang speech, the grammy interview, the whole grammy 360 cam, the UN speech, the first bbmas vkive and that tiktok with halsey @BTS_twt
Sadly this speech is not consistent with their upcoming performance for the benefit of KSA. It's shameful that this hypocrisy is being rugswept & even gaslit rather than confronted. I believe BTS truly believes the words Namjoon spoke to the UN but the Riyadh show is antithetical
What you should watch is BTS speech at the UN. So inspirational and motivating. pic.twitter.com/ixKsL3oE1g
I got into a fight with locals about BTS being at the UN and giving a speech. The dude goes “I don’t think any artist should be at the UN or in any political matter.....that’s like the Red Hot Chili Peppers giving a speech at the UN” I’m sorry.... what.
can you believe the first video i saw of bts was the un speech? like thanks to that i was like bitch we might stan after all
Good thanks joonie! I just had an interview and watched your UN speech before I went in
I forced my mom to watch the un speech and she only understood that bts support campaigns like end child violence and I'm like skskks there's so much more eye-
Just imagine the impact of that speech in UN of KIM NAMJOON aka RM together with his 6 brothers JIN, SUGA, JHOPE, JIMIN, TAE & JK of @BTS_twt to the kids that they even memorized it. Like WOW! #BTSMVAs #PURPLECARPET #MPN #BTS #ARMY #BoyWithLuvhttps://twitter.com/BTSOriented/status/1165983763794452480 …
Today I asked my gf “can you name any of the BTS boys since I RT them loads?” she was like “umm John.. Jung.. Jonkoo? Joncuck? Uhh.. Jim- ... V? Is he the main one? The UN speech one?”
I hope someone can give you all the real details about this. Kpoopies fandoms suffer from selective amnesia and now denied all the bad things they did to BTS, but ARMY and even BTS haven't forgot. BTS keep mention in their songs , even their UN speech how people diminish them.
I’m hoping BigHit will make a children’s book about all the beautiful messages BTS has said and include his UN speech at the end of the book @BTS_twt
Every moment with BTS is my happy moment..but when they gave a speech in the UN then the Grammy..such happy and proud moment for all of us
Joon's UN speech is the new 'Friends' but empowering. ( @BTS_twt #BTS #ARMY #BoyWithLuv )https://twitter.com/BTSOriented/status/1165983763794452480 …
BTS did the UN Speech on my birthday
Anyways , at least BTS fans aren't racist. BTS went to UN and their leader RM gave a speech. STAN BTS pic.twitter.com/oVON2zIFbY
i wanna talk about all the lyrics from bts' discography namjoon's UN speech has lemme make a thread
Hold on I just realized next month it’ll be 1 year since BTS were at the UN and Joon gave his Speak Yourself speech pic.twitter.com/X0Ltez0t6O
+ and she said "I really love RAP MONSTERRRR, I watched their speech in UN and it was amazing, now I do know why did BTS hv a big impact towards you" I always ignored her when she judged BTS bcs I knew that she dnt know which one is them and I let she found abt it herself +
As a parent myself, I think they are just worried about you. Try not to get down about it or blame them, they obviously don't understand. Maybe start to introduce them to.the really positive side of BTS eg UN speech, UNICEF campaigns etc.
bts un speech pic.twitter.com/kIs6znpBnx
It would be my first ARMY Birthday in 1 month and 4 days. Seems like last month when I watched the UN speech at Facebook and then proceeded to watch the Jimmy Fallon interview and then the rest is history. Wow, what a year with @BTS_twt.
My favorite memory is going to my first @BTS_twt concert - D2 in Hamilton, CAN. The most surprising and proudest moment is their UN speech. #1YearWithAnswer #PersonaIsTheAnswerpic.twitter.com/03HmmlGy8R
-7 Men, -6 Years -Single Summit -26 Daesang -Grammy Award Presentation -51 Stadium Tours -4 Billboards -AMAs performance -The Most Watched MV in 24 hours -The First Korean to receive RIAA Certification -UN speech...and millions of fans @BTS_twt and more...
my nana is visiting for the weekend and she saw my decorated room - she was telling me about the BTS mvs she's watched and saying that they're really moral individuals especially the un speech she watched
i think even up till now, i still haven't been able to wrap my head around just how amazed i am at namjoon's un speech. he did it at 24, in a language he learnt by himself, talking about loving and speaking up for yourself. simply so astounding @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/9Txxr4EUXQ
wait shit i wanted to rewatch bts un speech but fuck joons voice so deep for what
The biggest flex no the biggest happiness for me is when all the @BTS_twt members stood beside Namjoon while he gave his speech at UN's General Assembly. All 7 of them together. A blessing. #MPN #BTS #ARMY #BoyWithLuv
he inspires me to accept and love myself and he made me become a better person. i always use his UN speech as reference to inspire other people with their music as well #MPN #BTS #ARMY #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
things bts did in the past few last years: - earned 2 gold albums in USA -love yourself speech at un -first Korean group to do a concert in wembley -USA tv shows interviews/performances -Grammy nomination #PERSONAWENTGOLDpic.twitter.com/Y8s9Rrakvw
i can think of another fandom that hates on mamamoo MUCH more but okay... also bts has by far the biggest fanbase & we all know there are ldiots in every fandom. now go watch namjoon’s UN speech and grow up
-did with the Rolling Stone. And she said she likes how music connects everyone and brings we all together. I even told her about BTS’s speech at the UN and our freebie event. She said she would love to go to a BTS concert next time around
I remember it clearly right after Joon’s UN speech, something just clicked in me that It is actually okay to let the people hear your voice. I’ve spent years keeping my voice down and it affected my mental health bcs I didn’t let it out often. But after I know BTS -
bts: influencers, the biggest boy band of this generation, they gave a speech in the UN, millionaires, dancers, singers, rappers, producers, billboard artists, recording academy members, the first korean group performing at the wembley stadium. also bts: pic.twitter.com/ANvsm7I6Aq
“Only kpop band to give a UN speech” “They are young leaders of UNICEF” “Recording academy members “ Also bts:pic.twitter.com/bA21ZkN7oA
@BTS_twt @bts_bighit when ever I came up to see your UN speech and your happiness I ask myself if I was there what should I do!? The sure thing is that I will shout and cry because of my brothers and sisters in Palestine! And I dont respect these old sleepy deaf blind UN people!
#AskWYN Hi Ms. @wynmarquez can you please do to review on the BTS UN speech last year. I jst want to know ur thoughts. Hope umabot sayo tong request ko. Thank you. Borahae
lol one year and 4 months later: -bts hold a speech at the UN -they won 2 BBMAs -they went to the Grammys -bet their own record of the most sold korean album. EVER. -have sold more albums than SM with their 20 artist (no shade, love sm artists) +
My friends showed me namjoon‘s speech at the UN & I was never the same
when hobi said “army you’re my umbrella” or joon’s entire UN speech #MPN #BTS #ARMY @BTS_twt
it's official, my dad is a new bts army he is watching their UN speech, news and live performances
It really is Sort of has a similar energy as Joon’s UN speech... or when they talk about their past selves, etc. That theme of one’s past self always makes me really emo. I don’t even know why - I guess because that’s such a big part of life. Just it passing by
Whether it’s his ending ments, during the UN speech, or even casually in BTS episodes or movies, you can tell how much he cares about the other BTS members and how thoughtful he is about everything. His words are truly inspirational and all of his work has deeper meaning. pic.twitter.com/10eEBxk5uG
Namjoon, because I heard that a group from Korea was going to deliver a speech to the UN and it surprised me. I listened to him, and he changed my life. In a way I got into BTS exactly like Jungkook: one look at Namjoon and I decided, this — this is where I’ll stay. https://twitter.com/ludicjoon/status/1164305506921586693 …

I support BTS’ friendships w/ other idols. But I’ve not given others a listen. I’ve been told others are talented too (my goddaughter is a “multi-stan”). I wasn’t into anything Kpop or Kdrama pre-BTS. I got into them via UN speech then I fell for their music & personalities.
Your welcome. I used to watch CNN all day but it was so depressing & then CNN lead me to @BTS_twt bec I saw report on UN Speech & my world became much brighter. So for this, I’m forever grateful
i might just have a good cry to namjoons un speech
My mom said Namjoon is cool cause of the UN speech, at least she gets that hahahaha
Other than winning a Grammy I don't know what BTS can do to top a UN Speech

I really do talk to her about BTS. Like i even showed her RM's UN SPEECH and made her listen to it till then end. Hhhh
When I first watched his speech at the UN I cried, and I showed it my mum. After she watched she understood why I love BTS so much and I got even a concert ticket for my bd he just inspires me to love myself, accept my flaws and be happy with what is given to me.
#ARMYZIP why has nobody talked about these 2 lines, one in intro: persona and the other in joon’s UN speech??? It wasn’t talked about when @BTS_twt dropped persona & nobody’s saying anything now either!!!! pic.twitter.com/35c68P6O4N
my mom is the best, but at first she didn't respect them as artists & thought they only do it for money, until I showed her how they treat they fans and especially after bts un speech. Now she really listens when I talk about it
why... tf... i saw this in the bts un speech vid pic.twitter.com/0EgS1StjxG
Just my mom. Since i only stan bts she admits that bts are inspiring especially after i showed her namjoon's UN speech. While my dad cant relate coz hes xenophobic https://twitter.com/shuaslut/status/1163458090886475776 …
my mum loves jin bc she loves handsome men and she loves rms english and his speech at the un and bts does charity stuff too so she uses them as a role model for me
This is the speech they gave at the UN https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
Namjoon's UN speech, I just wanted to know their names, I don't remember what happened next pic.twitter.com/aKybDRYsjr
“I love you more than yesterday but less than tomorrow” might not exactly be a bts quote but hearing that from them is so cute also the WHOLE un speech by our president....
Remember when Joon read comments saying he doesn't look like an idol, calling BTS hideous, and questioning his credibility as a rapper? He really said he'll prove them wrong and went on to the Grammys and delivered a speech at the UN skskskksksksksks THE FLEX
Where's my " i know every line of BTS's/ RM's speech at UN and I cry while saying it with him" squad at
Had a Quotes competition for Pride Month at work n I wrote a phrase from Joon’s UN speech. Out of 50 entries, 5 were selected and m amongst the 5. 2nd pic is the prize(T-shirt). M happy I got it but m more happy they selected Joon’s phrase. @BTS_twt n they said it’s very unique. pic.twitter.com/R6pyF1EqrB
That’s normal, anyways stream BTS UN speech pic.twitter.com/xDFGeREnFz
how could they talk about bts, the people who have a UNICEF campaign and made a speech at the literal UN about respecting yourself & others, and then say something so fucking disgusting. that is so wrong. i'm sorry you had to see that, you don't deserve to be spoken to like that.
can like namjoon put his un speech at the beginning of one of bts's songs before the music starts?
- MMA Idol Stage. I fell because of this - Spring day, BST, Mic Drop, Run, Not today MV - always mentions their solo work on soundcloud depend on people's taste - UN speech - Interview in Grammy museum
i agree that armys can (and should) feel comfortable not liking absolutely everything bts puts out, but she literally said joon's un speech was hypocrite, that's anti behaviour
Yep this has been me since I found @BTS_twt while watching CNN reporting on their UN Speech. Hope I don’t get fired from my job as a wife & stay at home mom. I still perform my jobs but w earbuds in listening to BTS when I’m home alone, running errands even in grocery store
Love the idea of a “starter kit”! ...this is what I usually start with when sharing BTS: -Ellen show clips -Jimmy Fallon show clips -Save Me, DNA, Dope MV -UN speech highlights -MAMA 2018 performance -Baepsae dance practice. #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt
What an amazing way to find out about BTS! The UN speech is on a whole other level. I remember watching it live while on a train on my way home from seeing them in concert for the first time. It was so moving I cried the entire time
I stumbled upon their UN speech on YouTube and from that second i knew this group is different :) I wasn't into K-entertainment at all haha #MTVHottest #BTS @BTS_twt
does anyone else hate how kpoppies compare their faves current mistakes to bts' 2014-past mistakes like? even ppl who claim to be fans are so obviously not when a un speech exists, and namjoon literally said he makes mistakes but u know, selective hearing must be a thing.
epiphany that we first need to love ourselves before we can love others and be loved for who we truly are. "Speak Yourself" is the continuation of this topic. Following their speech at the UN in which they emphasized the importants that after you've learned to know and love +

meanwhile army teachers only use bts when it's relevant to the class. i.e armys who used bts' speech at the UN to exemplify values armys who use bts song lyrics in literature classes etc https://twitter.com/tearkives/status/1163107864308793344 …
i mentioned bts' wembley concert at a family dinner today and my uncle got so excited, saying he had seen the un speech on tv and that he didn't know anything about them but they looked like amazing people with great values. i've never been more proud in my LIFE
BTS and I recommend Jung's Map of The Soul, for those who want to find rationalizations in everything. And then, try listening to BTS' Love Yourself/MoTS albums + RM's UN Speech. #TwinFlames #ArtistTwinFlamesInPublicEye #CelebrityTwinFlames #FamousTwinFlames #WellKnownTwinFlames
at grammys. at getting their radio spins here, which is very hard for non spanish/english speaking artists. at bbmas every year, their UN speech, they've only given me reasons to be proud of them i love them lots
calling bts misogyn*st while there a picture of namjoon giving his un speech, lmao honey he literally said "no matter who you are , what your skin color is, what your gender orientation is, speak yourself." Do some research
I let them watch the video when BTS give a speech in the UN #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/ArmyBrigade13_H/status/1163103831946870785 …
1). I really like RM at the firstsight from speech at UN. I love his attitude, power and don’t give up. That’s words there give me more self confidence and love myself when i feel down. So, I want to say Thanks not only RM, but also all member of BTS!!
On Friday I shared with my students RM's speech he gave at the UN to start our school year off on a positive note. A great message for teens. @BTS_twt #btsloveyourselfcampaign #UNICEFpic.twitter.com/Aha2fBFoig
Well I know I’m an older ARMY member at 57 but I completely agree w u. This amazing fandom & the multitalented global artists they support is truly incredible & has blown my mind since I stumbled upon @BTS_twt watching CNN reporting their UN speech. That day chg my life 4ever
I've known BTS for a long time but I started to really pay attention around early-2018 and decided to just stan them after their UN speech
So much quality just in one man.. Kim Namjoon is the best leader of BTS, talented, intelligent with IQ148, gave speech in UN for #ENDviolence, one of main writers in BTS songs..i Just know him and amazed by him with BTS
BTS got nominated and presented an award at Grammy, had a speech on UN, First Korean group to perform at Wembley stadium, First Korean group to top U.S bb 200, first group since the Beatles to send three albums to the the number one spot in America in less than a year and so on. https://twitter.com/hoshistrawberry/status/1162008457614151680 …
And before she saw RM's UN speech she thought BTS were some idiots that didn't have a reason to be famous.
Came across Namjoon's UN speech in Oct last year.. looked him up..started listening and there was no turning back.
This perfectly describes me. My intro 2 BTS was via CNN reporting of their UN Speech. I knew of Psy bec of his popular song but never his fan. Although I know more Kpop grp names now, I’m still not a Kpop fan. I’m only a BTS fan bec they r more than Kpop. They r global artists
Nah don’t agree with jus bc bts did that un speech that they’re politicians or should be seen that way. Everyone’s own opinion i guess
y'all be like omo i'm such a bts stan but y'all clearly only care abt their looks and not their music nor their message... did u EVEN watch Namjoon's speech at the UN?? DO Y'ALL EVEN CARE ABOUT THE LOVE YOURSELF LOVE MYSELF MESSAGE? nah namjoon is disappointed
Day 13: I was really happy when I watched him give his speech at the UN. While he was speaking, I thought about how far we've come - BTS/ARMY and myself, personally. I was so proud of them and myself and I most definitely cried. #30days_RM_Challenge #30일_남준_챌린지 @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/BMiLhxBCKa
First saw @BTS_twt in 9/18 on CNN’s coverage of their UN speech then had 2 know more. As I saw, learned & listened 2 more my obsession grew. It’s hard 2 pick 1 moment when I became ARMY bec my fall into the wormhole was hard & glorious all at the same time #MTVHottest BTS
Do y'all just ever get anxiety then u watch Namjoon's speech at UN and bawl your eyes out , then watch run EPs , BTS being crackhead for 10 mins or even viewing a plain ass video of BTS watching at the camera doing nothing? Yes, I do #MPN #BTS #ARMY #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
I began stanning bts in September 2018 bc I saw their UN speech on Instagram lol
"Maybe I made a mistake yesterday. But yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’ll be me too." - Kim Namjoon @BTS_twt, UN speech (2018) pic.twitter.com/eVwU7vvARF
For me, rm's un speech is the best memory that they had. BTS are meant to taught us on how to love ourselves. They also taught us that we deserve better and accept our flaws. pic.twitter.com/GRlD7I8VkR
Unforgettable memories of BTS 2018 • BTS in UN SPEECH wherein RM gave us strong and inspirational message • BTS in BBMAs, showing us that BTS really bacomes a global phenomenon • BTS in MAMA 2018, that made us emotional @lucidjikook @choisbn @epipeny @BTSGL00M @PaleYoonipic.twitter.com/lkyLzZXKZU
Best BTS Memories: UN Speech, MAMA 2018, FESTA 2018, BTS on TheEllenShow 2018, BTS on Billboard Music Awards 2018 ...every BTS moments were the BEST tbh.. @minieejimin @itsyourfirstLIE @bangtanina6 @_jamaishyo @bunbunjeongpic.twitter.com/1nN973Nc3o
Bts' speech at the UN https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
I often say: "Whatever you can get if you work hard."and "if others can, so I can too." Expecially after hearing Namjoon's speech at the UN, wow that really opened my mind. After I got to know BTS, half my life changed from dark to light. Indonesia #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt
BTS make me feel better with their songs and comments. I really like awake and love myself because i really can relate with the lyrics. Their comments like how namjoon conforts everyone. Their speech at UN also become my source of strength. They makes me move on and keep living
Wasn’t prepared, always have a tear with the clips from the UN speech. The King of our world. #namjoon @tigertigerpjm @minabbigail #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/imwisertomorrow/status/1161694876624478209 …
his thoughts, the lyrics he writes and his rap are soooo fine. and oh, please listen to the speech he delivered at the UN. @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
I was a new kpop fan so I didn't knew much stuff, I only knew about the leader and I thought it was joon bcoz of you know his speech at UN and also I thought he was the oldest but I never thought kookie was the maknae and Jin the oldest
It's been a year since I decided I couldn't shut up about bts on my local account so I made a stan one I also made it after UN speech. #MyTwitterAnniversarypic.twitter.com/xYAsoThXbe
I based my Legal Studies paper around this and @BTS_twt Namjoon’s UN speech. Iconic. https://twitter.com/yungblud/status/1162049775157620736 …
I first watched their DNA performance on AMAs, but I didn't get REALLY into them until I listened to RM's speech at the UN. Then I wanted to know everything about BTS. Now I can't go a day without them pic.twitter.com/WtobZuN2uu
I was almost suicide when i got depressed, and I saw Namjoon's speech at the UN video. At that time. I realised, im not that useless. Somebody loved me. Haven't found it yet but with BTS, i feel loved.
just found out that my whole big family knows bts all of my cousins stan bts the moment they started mentioning jin tae and jungkook i fckn lost my shit hsjsjsks i showed my aunt the un speech and she likes it wah im so proud imagine not stanning @BTS_twt we can never relate pic.twitter.com/9jWVMrifR5
this is the cutest thing I’ve ever read our moms are intellectuals and same! my mom loved namjoon ever since the un speech recently I’ve shown her interviews and says hobi is is bright and always happy she loves both so much
LIT RALLY MY MOM she was totally joon biased after i showed her the UN speech & everything but she now she loves hobi too & constantly answers my phone calls with “i’m your hope, you’re my hope” skfjsksk moms 4 namseok
As Kim Namjoon also know as the leader of BTS, stated at his UN speech "no matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity: speak yourself.” Never have I seen a band so devoted to the preaching of love yourself. + @CNBCMakeIt
check out they’re speech at the UN, it was wonderful. BTS are 7 guys from South Korea, they debuted in 2013 with a company that nobody knew, worked their ass off to reach their dream and they made it. They’re still so humble, kind-hearted, and treat their fans like friends- -
. @BTS_twt are also know for their philanthropy, each personally donating to their own causes, & as a band, launched their #BTSLoveMyself campaign in partnership w/ @UNICEF, which has now raised over $2M so far. The leader RM also gave a speech @the UN. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1076405734097600512 …
My mum fully agree what rm said during the un speech and my parents are supportive too unlike my friend's parents keep calling them chinese gay boys and not letting them go to concerts but my parents said next time when bts comes back to London i can go :')
I just read in "Into the Magic Shop" written by Doty "who we are today doesn't have to be who we are tomorrow" It reminded me of Namjoon's speech at the UN @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/QfvzlKVrMA
I was at a family reunion n I asked my czn if she know bts n she said heard of them but don't really know them asked to explain n I explained the bu, love yourself campaign,un speech etc ... She WAS IMPRESSED
And this came out after that time Namjoon gave his UN speech. How can he be that same person? How can you not love these dorks?
I just rewatched a bunch of videos of BTS being at the bbmas, grammys, amas, important American talk shows, the UN speech, them winning daesangs, saw positive comments from locals abt their performances... now my army ego is at its highest peak pic.twitter.com/a21dPWZgvx
Whenever I feel lazy, I remember Namjoon writing an amazing last-minute UN speech and practicing relentlessly even with a full work schedule #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt
pls i still cant believe bts made that speech in UN .. pls .. im so so fucking proud of joonie .. remember that day when we cried and we were so proud of him for being the best leader and for leading the group always
Giving a speech at the UN is sexy too. #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/vEgcuG5wq3
My father used to dislike them as well until he heard Namjoon's speech at the UN. The prejudice against BTS is so sick, I hope non-armys see past thru it and try to get to know them better. Hating on popular things doesn't make you cool, it makes you JUDGMENTAL.
Like literally not even mentioning the UN speech or the LY campaign that got proceeds of BTS love yourself album sales and even on their ww tour. So many things missed. So much stereotyping and generalization. Call it a kpop: an introduction video instead.
i told vini that bts made a speech at UN and he was like well if it was Hani hip thrusting "up and down" we would have world peace now
me watching the bts speech at the un pic.twitter.com/ypQBfDz25h
a title track, bc usually if our teachers ever play bts or kpop they would play title tracks. soo yeah basically our lesson in that period was abt self love and litterally i was lowkey hoping that she would show namjoon's UN speech.
They apologized for woh and for ca. Both of these things were made in 2013/2014. They haven't done problematic stuff since 2015 and now they're out there talking about self love and giving speech at the UN. Thinking that BTS is problematic in 2k19 is just stupid.
i don't want to be rude but it seems like you're PATHETIC. people like you always trying to find bad things about bts. go watch namjoon's UN speech, maybe you learn hating people is not a good thing. anygays stream epiphany and dna for clear skin.
BTS: donating millions of dollars to charity every year, have books about surviving mental illness, gave a speech at the UN about ending violence ....etc etc etc the fanbase: well maybe if you streamed bwl you'd have good nail beds checkmate
Did you know that @BTS_twt gained fans from their @UN SPEECH for @UNICEF ??
found myself AGAIN watching RM 's UN Speech. and watching people reacts to it as well. Namjoon 's really is a great speaker, he speaks frm the heart thats why it sounds so sincere. I love yah Kim Namjoon. you have my respect... @BTS_twt
i jus rewatched bts reacting to their debut stage nd iforgot that yoongi said he would tell their former selves that it‘s gonna be hard but if they hang in there theyre gnna become "worldwide superstars" nd then he mentioned the un speech n their #1 on billboard n imso sad now
Day 1 i was probably passing the worst time of my life when i first heard a song from mono,moonchild and it just speaked to me.i googled him,found BTS,heard his speech at UN and i hv stanned since then his music,his personality,his way of seeing life-amazing #30DAYS_RM_CHALLENGEhttps://twitter.com/KNJ1806/status/1160903038036410369 …
well, bts made 3 albums + a japanese comeback (multilingual kings), 2 soloalbums, 6 singles, went on 2 world tours while writing their own music, went to countless korean awardshows and performed, did a speech at the UN and had a campain with unicef. in the span of a year
It’s called a Stan account Aden, and they’re not gifs they’re fancams. And actually namjoon is quite political! He made a speech at the UN and is quite vocal on that kind of thing. Also I’m surprised your sister hasn’t told you more about it, I talk to her all the time about BTS
Babie is gonna spend his bday as Kim Namjoon not RM. "I am Kim Nam Joon. I am also RM of BTS". -BTS UN Speech- If you see me crying, mind your own bussiness. https://twitter.com/yoonjns/status/1160564422668169222 …
Bts said this in the un speech but someone here, you and your homophobic ass friends are not too smart I guess
I literally dmed twtsuppirt “help a homie out and let me vote for my boys bts” on my friend’s acc and then linked joon’s un speech and they unsh@dowbanned me within a day but last time I wrote a whole ass paragraph with pointers and they took MONTHS
Pls c if u can get this 2 this misguided & misinformed individual. How much do u know abt BTS? Not much frm wht I c. Have u listened 2 the enlightened speech Kim Namjoon gave @the UN. Do u know of their wrk w/UNICEF? Their campaign 2 end violence & bullying? JUST LISTEN.
I may fool around & "ship" jikook. I love every member of BTS. Their looks r great, the work is wonderful. The mssgs in their songs r why I love them. The UN speech, UNICEF, the mssg "LOVE YOURSELF: SPEAK YOURSELF". Who they are inside & outside. https://twitter.com/vkookssky/status/1160222289608052737 …
When they attended the UN assembly and RM delivered his legendary speech. That hit me directly to my purple heart . I felt like i was the proudest mother in the world @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/notsweetbtstea/status/1159983121661603840 …
bts could have addressed much more serious issues in their un speech instead of, idk, self-love white girl shit? but ok whatever makes you happy i guess
bruh the same thing happened at my sister’s bachelorette sksjsjsjs her friends saw my joon pc on the back of my phone and started asking me questions abt them and she told them abt joon’s un speech and their unicef campaign god i love this for me my family are bts sponges
KSHSJSHSJ YOURE EMBARRASSING1d never done the things bts are doing all they do is sing the same songs abt heartbreak that they didn't even write I was a directoner too but what did they teach me? Nothing. What did bts teach me? Everything. Their speech at the un is a proof
directioners still think they r doing smthing by dragging bts show me one directions speech at the un n the genuine love between the members n also selfwritten inspirational lyrics that deal with anything besides romance .... u cant cause theyre all Nonexistent
My aunt’s husband started to ask me things about bts and we talked about them for a moment and now he’s interested in them and likes them all, especially Namjoon & he wants me to send him songs & Namjoon’s UN speech i love promoting my kings #MPN #BTS #ARMY #BoyWithLuv
BRO. What if I make a huge cookie and put namjoons un speech on there WAIT- I CAN MAKE A CAT COOKIE AND A BTS COOKIE AND MANY OTHER COOKIES SSKSKJSKSJS
They’re a 7 member South Korean boyband :) BTS writes about navigating adulthood, mental health, self-love, working hard for yourself, the struggles of youth, etc. They also write the most poetic love songs. Here’s a speech they made at the UN in 2018: https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156?s=21 …
can bts put namjoon un speech in an album so i can say stream namjoon's speech
You want BTS to be a whole icon and symbol of a movement, so you bring up their unicef campaign and UN speech CONSTANTLY. Yet you also say “hey! Why do you want BTS to save and change the world? They are just seven dudes ” You guys are peak brainless.
I just realised I downloaded the full BTS UN speech should I put it on the end of my car mixtape?
BTS × GRAMMYS,,, recording artists,,, BBMAS + the 2 awards,,, UN speech,,, BTS selling out Wembley,,,, and that performance to commemorate the Beatles the list goes on and on yet these boys still stay super humble i love them so much https://twitter.com/cultmins/status/1159927734640029698 …
I feel the same, especially at work. If im asked something about BTS I feel like they’re snickering “30 yo who likes a boyband”. I thought of printing parts of RMs UN speech on a cup and leave it in the kitchen to provoke interest... Maybe they’d google and see for themselves?

Times where I actually cried over bts was when they said they were thinking of disbanding and during Namjoons UN speech.
Im from a beautiful country.. PHILIPPINES! I have lots of fave bts moment because every second they share their lives with us is precious But two of my faves are their speech in UN.. it really touched me deep and second is whenever they are just having the time of their lives +
i heavily talked abt how bts are part of the endviolence campaign with unicef and joons speech at the un !! whoever reads this will understand why bts has such a large impact on their fans
The fact that I'll graduate from high school in 2020 makes me so happy ! U'll know that the BTS speech in UN was related to "Youth 2020" and obviously us 2020 students! Good luck for all of us .
I do some research to which group that match with my taste of music. Initially I didn't immediately choose BTS, stupid me. BUT in the middle of January, I think? I saw Namjoon's video speech on UN (yes, I had followed some base for army) and I love him.
@bts_bighit I have watched the bts speech given by RM at the UN. I encourage everyone to do so. It was a heartfelt call for social justice and truth. BRAVO, gentlemen.
Watching RM’s speech at the UN, blew me away that 7 young men could do so much good in the world for many people #MPN #BTS #ARMY @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt pls put the UN speech on the next album as a skit i beg
I’m actually croaking but I’m so excited, ngl it’s crazy how much bts influenced my career decisions LMAOOOO I wanted to be a whole ass doctor but then I saw what they were doing with their campaigns and their UN speech and I was like “damn sign me up for that”
Like you said your bias is Namjoon, you should watch his speech at the UN :)
thank you so much for helping our boys achieve their dream of making the world a better place!!The LoveMyself Campaign and the speech at the UN means so much to them, and to us, truly... thank you for seeing the good in BTS and ARMY and working so hard for children of the world♡
"Do you know BTS?" And if someone is even slightly interested let them know all about them. So welcome down the rabbit hole. Check of the UN speech Namjoon did it was amazing. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
people need to stop making jokes like "bts are bad" because they've worked so hard to come where they are today. sure, they were a bit problematic when they debuted, but they've changed. the love yourself campaign? the speech at the un? the end violence campaign? come on man
"Influential"??? So r we forgetting how bts is the most awarded Korean act, has a cultural merit award, gave a un speech, brings 4 billion per yr to Korean economy. Y'all don't know what "Influential" means n it shows n y'all expect people to take u seriously??
i mean she does sometimes rt news bout bts esp bout their unicef projects n other in relation,, and also some the lyrics thread. lowkey should have seen it coming when i saw her rt the namjoon UN speech pic scoo pa something (sorry i forgot)
BTS is for anybody By the way, have you seen Namjoon's speech at the UN? It really gives an insight to how he thinks and it links back to what's portrayed in their film https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
This is very typical Jimin Stan’s response when there is a negative comments about other members. I acknowledge BTS bc of RM UN speech and I become fan bc of Jimin.
I just saw they talked about bts and kpop in spanish national tv and they were really respectful, they even included namjoon's speech at the un please take notes
bts has a whole campaign in which merch goes 100% to donation, their love yourself series had 3% income donated to charities, now raised exactly 1,981,344$and they even went to UN to make a speech, what are you trying to prove? sm trying to go by bts’ steps to show THEY ‘care’?
Taehyung's video of introducing the #IPurpleYou phrase will always be my most fave video of BTS (2nd is Namjoon's speech in UN). Tae was going thru a hard time but he gave a simple yet powerful message to his fans. U can fl how much we matter to him. We dont deserve Kim Taehyung.
stan botmys that can get BTS 2B spotify stream in 2018, grammy invitation, Top Group BBMA, TS BBMA, UN speech, millions of dollars for their LY campaign, and BB charts higher than your grades for 2019. https://twitter.com/jenjenmilk/status/1159601825139609600 …
So my friend who works in the UN has officially become an ARMY after watching Bring The Soul. She’s the same friend who sent me @BTS_twt pics and videos when they gave their speech I’m so happy to have another irl friend who became ARMY

ughhh im soo happy the news portrayed bts as a talented “korean band” and they skipped the whole “13 yo fangirls of a fandom” agenda and instead talked abt their message and their achievements like the love yourself campaign and the un speech. This is who n why we stan, locals.
Haha this is becuase my friends are working, the daft you have to stalk my account to try and prove your incoherent and evidently hypocritical point shows how delusional you are, kpop has huge influence. Name another artist that's made a speech at the UN :)
love yourself & stan @BTS_twt , i hate myself before im depressed & i commited suicide but when i watched RM's speech at the UN #ENDviolence campainge i realised they taught me how to love myself and im lucky that i found them they are my hero thanks bts thanks is not enough
so.... my mom just watched bts’ un speech.... she was really impressed im rly convinced joon’s her bias now (so far)
It's quite sad. I know some Exo Ls here. And they will talk about exo achievements, etc but one word of BTS achievements it's nothing special like the UN speech and Cultural merit award those achievements are amazing. But they always brush it off to praise their boys achievements
literally same! my mom was all joon at first after she heard his UN speech but she couldn’t help but fall in love with hobi because they’re both “crazy aquarius’” shdjjd but her fave bts song is epiphany !
i love it how yall say BTS whenever joon does something you like BTS speech at UN. BTS is humble according to Namjoon's letter about himself. BTS is this BTS is that. yeah but can yall let joon have his own words for himself???? bts as a whole is great but why using joon's words?
bitches be calling bts flop while they break records are part of the Grammy academy, sold out stadiums gave speech at UN are called next generation leaders has a impact of more than 5 trillion won in the economy of their country, the clownery
hey man, I'm writing my university thesis about your UN speech and you decided to tweet, guess who will never get tired of your wonderful persona? yeah, me.
*bts attends grammys, wins lots of bbma awards, sells out stadiums, works hard and no sleep (literally), gets a speech at the un*
i said UN recognized. As in the United Nations. Where they gave a speech. And no, I really can't, because the category they were nominated in was meant to separate asian artists from western ones.
just rewatched the mama 2018 artist of the year speech and the speech at the un and... i am in Shambles.. my love for bts is literally exploding out of my heart right now no one touch me pic.twitter.com/ue1CNBzgHg
write down joon's un speech
Y'all see armys saying they find bts from meme, crack video to mv or lyrics video on yt, award show and UN speech n you will see us chill
The only shit Crayon can achieve is with the help of their toxic fans while BTS out there helping people with their music and even giving a speech at the UN. That's it. Crayon members never do anything when it comes to their music. Their songs are produced and written by other
hmm, seems like a tough situation. you mentioned that bts has made you more happy, so maybe you could start by showing your mom how. to convince my mom to come and watch bring the soul with me, i showed her their un speech bc that really had an impact on me++

oohhh sorry because #ENDViolence has a lot of scipe sweetie. U better re-watch what RM said in their UN Speech. And it’s u who BTS don’t want to be their fans. At least i’m embodying what they stand for in all it’s meaning. And fyi, big starts from little.
#RMoment Why favourite moments of Namjoon and BTS are their letter reading to each other And also the UN speech!!!
I discovered @BTS_twt watching Kim Namjoon’s UN speech in Sept 2018 & it’s been w wonderful journey indeed. Bless these remarkable young men & multitalented artists. I them all & my fellow Army too #MTVHottest BTS pic.twitter.com/ffCrju32YH
Honestly aside from Namjoon’s speech at the UN being my gateway to BTS, it’s my discovery of the BTS Universe that got me hooked into the story behind all of their content. It’s fascinating, like a mini Korean MCU. https://twitter.com/ThrowbacksBTS/status/1157900274117296128 …
Unicef is a really great organisation working with bts on #ENDviolence self love concepts, but ever since bts gave speech at the UN, 99% of the tweets are about bts and their campaign. I get it that they want to more people to be aware of it but they can also tweet continue
My fav GIF of Kim Namjoon is his speech at UN (9/18) bec this is the day & exact moment I discovered @BTS_twt I just had 2 know more abt this grp of remarkable young men from SK & so my quest began. My life chged that day & it’s been a fantastic journey ever since #MPN #BTS #ARMYpic.twitter.com/WzJUbUeRUo
I showed the UN speech to my parents...all they said was, Wow. Such a young boy, such extraordinary throw, such a precious message. My mom said there was ne need for subtitles. @BTS_twt , you did that. You told my parents that I listen to you for a reason.
he’s so loveablehe also did a speech at the UN! All of BTS was there but he wrote the speech as he’s the most fluent in English. I love the president of the universe, kim namjoon
8. And they don't even have televisions or internet to see what is happening right across the border in South Korea. Can't see BTS on the Youtube. So, below is the video of the BTS kid's speech to the UN.
4. Started to search Youtube for BTS and United States, but before I could get "states" out, it showed BTS and United Nations, so I clicked on that as it interested me. I listened to a speech that one of these BTS kids gave at the UN, with the other BTS kids beside him.
Remember Philip DeFranco, the youtuber that covered bts snub @v/mas noms in one of his videos? I went thru his channel and saw he also talked about bts @the un assembly, particularly joon's speech. The replies... *chef's kiss* #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/bIrYMHksVE

I didn't get to vote T T so hear me rant I started stanning BTS after watching his UN speech even tho I had listening to their music from before ( didn't see MVs or even look them up to see who was in it) and he was the one who hd my eyes since my first MV fake love so

I highly disagree because BTS gave a speech at the UN meeting held last year for their campaign that they partnered with UNICEF and so far they’ve raised over $2 million. I’m pretty sure they’re not the “same band”.
Aaah.. she is the one interpreted joon's un speech @BTS_twt

So does BTS, they spoke at the UN considering that they are ambassador for it, not to mention English isn’t their first language, they still managed to pull off an amazing speech. Also their song lyrics speak about self-love and going after your dreams, plus many other things.
have u showed ur mom BTS UN speech? well u not alone though..even my mom was questioning us y bts..n wat makes em so different and stuff..
Oh, and PLEASE i recommend that you do some research on BTS before you say anything about them like at this point please at least watch their speech at the UN ASSEMBLY before you make an opinion bts is not like any other boyband they cured our depression with their message

When namjoon gave his UN speech my friend texted me saying "whyd I think that guy from BTS was black" I knew who it was immediately
i was showing my grandma the bts performance on snl and she points at namjoon and goes “that blonde one is insanely handsome!” and i was like yeah he is!!! then i showed her his UN speech. she was in AWE,, “he is intelligent and his english is so amazing.” she’s a namjoon stan.
#IHateWhenPeopleAskMe why I listen to BTS. Have you listened to their lyrics? Have you seen their UN speech? Have you seen them dance? Have you seen their #ENDViolence campaign? #LoveYourself enough to seek them out. Trust me: it will change your life. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/XgXZgDi9Li
I was already emotional enough with the trailer just being the way it is. Adding snippets of RM's speech for the UN is making me even more emotional. #KCAMexico #Army @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSGIobal/status/1156009180991410177 …
i've never been prouder of a band i stan than the moment bts made a speech in the un! look at all the positive headlines we're getting! fans usually say that they aren't denouncing their alt-right fans enough, so have a cute kiss <3
i cant believe to this day that kpoppies tried so hard to make the un speech seem irrelevant just because they hate bts. that was the most pathetic thing they have ever done https://twitter.com/tuziii551/status/1155922928371769344 …
#ENDViolence #Unicef #LoveYourself Adding #NamJoon #UN #Speech on top of an already significant and important #message from #BTS gives this #advert extra #power to the #visuals and subject matter. I had to share… https://www.instagram.com/p/B0nqwimlFh1/?igshid=rrdxlq572l9j …
my mom doesn’t even know bts she just likes namjoon for his UN speech
On the day of their un speech my mom suddenly messaged me their speech video. It was so surprising since she has always been clowning me and bts.
I watched BTS' speech at the UN again. I felt like crying. It was so insprational.
i’m gonna be saying a speech today at school i had so little time to prepare for. what if i get nervous, forget everything and impulsively say bts’ UN speech
My favorite memory of Bts is the UN speech or when they won artist of the year.
And let’s not act like BTS the only kpop group to make a speech at the UN told us to speak ourselves as well and that’s exactly what we doing
#KCAMexico #BTS #ARMY @BTS_twt "No matter who you are, where you from, your skin color, your gender identity, just Speak Yourself" - BTS UN Speech.
ok but WHERE did i say you were racist you’re literally reaching at this pointdndndjd all i said was to watch the bts UN speech !! 6 minutes of excellence from ACTUAL poc role models, so run along and stan the woman that’ll gladly play a role as a tree if that’s what ur into
mayhaps you should know that bts have apologised for every kind of cultural appropriation and anything else they’ve done in the past. you should probably watch the bts UN speech before coming at someone for having “muslim” in their @you weirdo, move lol
like aside everything a lot of ppl really don’t care about growth because bts have spoken up on so many issues yet it was kpop twitter calling their un speech cringey and stupid. right like imagine actually wanting to make a change and speak up omg that’s so embarrassing!
If you're gonna claim @BTS_twt aren't political and aren't activists you can stop bringing up their @UN speech and @UNICEF work
Watching again the @BTS_twt speech at the UN. I got AGAIN goosebumps. pic.twitter.com/0yOWWusa73
Thank u bts.. I still remember when rm gave speech in un saying that we need to speak for ourself and today I finally did and justice was served.. Thank u for being my support bts.. Love u alot...
This one brought me to my knees It was 1st concert Overwhelmed Army camping for weeks News outlet everywhere The hype after the UN speech Memories, coming, rushing pic.twitter.com/SmGe4mJXUa

“This is the second time @BTS_twt has worked with UNICEF following the group’s extremely successful “Love Myself” campaign from 2018, when they raised $1.4M to end violence against children. That same year, member RM gave a powerful speech at the UN.” https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bts-encourages-young-people-to-endviolence-new-unicef-video-international-friendship-day/amp?__twitter_impression=true …
My mom knows I am an ARMY but doesn't know about kpop in general but she can recognize SKZ's songs and praise TWICE's dances moves and my father only knows that BTS did an UN speech and I follow the ideas of the speech, so he thinks it's good.
watched bts speech at un again and uh – they truly are special and unique human beings
yes, my entire family knows and even my parents are fans of kpop. my dad has a lot more respect for bts since their un speech and that makes me really happy
Showed my friend Namjoon's UN speech and she cried a little. She doesn't stan (she's a normal person lol) and said it's beautiful for ppl like BTS to spread positive messages like that about loving yourself.
and because of it they got invited the the un to deliver a speech about it ,AND BTS got ranked 1st as the World's Most Sustainable Future Leader, by UN-supported SDGs Association at United Nations Headquarters in New York. So my bio is completely fine
Amazing edit. To add RM speech from the UN to part of this video. Just made me cry again at how wonderful this message is. Thank you for this. Everyone #BTSARMY should watch this it's simply awesome. #FriendshipDay #BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSGIobal/status/1156009180991410177 …
Yall mocked their UN speech saying it was 'vague', scream everyday tat bts sells mental illness,thinks bts,armys raising money for children in Yemen thru ts campaign is a concept,accuse bts of emotinally manipulating fanbase and nw what lol the day u talk abt ts campaign fr+
I want BTS to add Namjoon’s UN speech to one of their upcoming albums because it deserves to get heared whenever we need it.
Of course la world leaders kenal BTS. Diorg bagi speech kat UN kot. Femes. https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/groove/2019/06/496290/showbiz-malta-tourism-skyrockets-due-bts-effect-king-norway-wants …
It’s BTS time so I showed my mom their #EndViolence campaign and Namjoon’s speech at UN and she cried people. She cried.
Seeing the #EndViolence and #BTSLoveMyself trending reminds of RM's speech on UN Assembly! #FriendshipDay @BTS_twt ( #MGMAVOTE #BTS )
non kpop friend is apparently getting into bts because her best friend sent her the lyrics and the un speech.... their power !!!!
bts been politically aware since day 1 n i mean with their music too so unka kuch nahi jaaraha if we get political with the ksa sponsored concert these bitches r so proud of bts’ speak urself un speech but apparently tht shit only applies to ppl who have the same opinions as them
perhaps agong did some research and saw bts’ un speech unlike some people.
Malaysian's KING choose BTS ours agong should meet up with our president , kim namjoon ! the king recognizes BTS impact and message to the world. I mean BTS even gave speech at UN. World leaders must usually know this and how powerful BTS influences. #AgongKitapic.twitter.com/fueI2jsGDw
of course coz the king recognizes BTS impact and message to the world. I mean BTS even gave speech at UN. World leaders must usually know this and how powerful BTS influences.
aw he chose BTS the king probably saw their speech at the UN and knows how their music and meaningful lyrics has helped so many people around the world. in conclusion the king is an intellectual pic.twitter.com/EEFVdLxo2d
This was already beautiful and with Namjoon’s UN Speech added I just- . We love you, BTS! Thankful for all 7 of you and the joy you bring to our lives every single day! #BTSLoveMyself #EndViolence @BTS_twt
It was right after I learned their names when I watched Namjoon deliver his inspiring UN speech live to the world, as all eyes were on #BTS. I don't know what I'd do through my deep, personal struggles without these 7 shining stars! Thanks always to @BTS_twt #BTSLoveMyselfhttps://twitter.com/ctrItaegi/status/1155987186639986689 …
I'm so lucky to join in our fandom #ARMY since comeback Idol so I was so happy to know that #BTS was the first group to appear at the UN speech. It made me feel that I had a right choice .They've come so far but let's give them more. They deserve our love #KCAMexico @BTS_twt
Whenever I remember about the very first reason why I literally searched for their UN speech to seek help from my darkest day back then when I knew nothing about them, it is never without a heavy heart. Thank you. Thank you, @BTS_twt. #BTSLoveMyself #FriendshipDay #ENDViolence
not friendship day related but it belongs in my "bts are aroace role models" thread bc namjoon's UN speech is so incredibly poignant and inspiring. it's doubly incredible because he's self taught in english here's a transcript: https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/we-have-learned-love-ourselves-so-now-i-urge-you-speak-yourself …https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1076405734097600512?s=19 …
This is exactly how I came to know about BTS too, actually: through RM’s speech at the UN. https://twitter.com/JoonsBase/status/1155926523943067648 …
Imagine This if BTS ever makes another speech at the UN right afterwards a bunch of armies gather around near where the UN is and as BTS is coming out we start singing answer love myself I had this idea in my head and I was literally just crying imagining it

did i make a BTS presentation and make my class watch the UN speech? y e s pic.twitter.com/IE5A13VoQH
ive literally never felt more comfortable stanning BTS other western artists ive stanned also had some non-romance/sex songs but i joined during the love yourself era and i was completely blown away by the intensity of their message. and then there was namjoon's UN speech :")
I genuinely think the world would be a much better place if everybody just listened to bts and the message they convey. I’m not even saying that everyone should stan and buy all their albums. Just watch Namjoon’s UN speech. Listen to Love Myself. I promise you’ll feel better.
ive started to in love with bts since their speech at the un general assembly last year. the point that really touch me right in my heart, they really aware of mental issues. their 'love yourself' campaign really help young genereations actualizing the world without violence.
It's because I wasn't following them on Twitter, I found out about the speech 5 days later, I was mostly on YouTube watching their videos / explanations of them and their music :( le mother didn't let me know when it happened
it took you 5 days? it took me seconds right after RM’s speech!

This was a beautiful speech.

The way we memorized every sentence of joonie's UN speech like as if it's a bts song :( #Endviolence #BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/A7deupVTl2
I think the most dangerous thing to do now would be to listen to namjoon’s un speech, a sad bts song or watch the young forever fan project at Wembley...in no particular order
I found Bts when I my mind was in an extremely dark place. There music soothed me on nights where I would cry. When I heard the UN and love your self speech I cried because Namjoons words were describing how I have used them to love myself.————

I remember when bts gave their speech at the UN i’m still so proud of namjoon and the rest of the guys. I cried so much, so many happy tears because I really picked such an amazing group to look up to. Thank you bts #EndViolence

Whenever I feel down, I should remind myself that Kim Namjoon didn't give a UN speech alongside BTS for me not to love myself ! ! !
This edit reminded of how extraordinary and wonderful bts are and how lucky I really am to be able to witness their power. They are just too good for our world. To answer namjoons question in the un speech... You make my heart beat, BTS DO! omg I'm so emotional rn jsjsjsk
made my English teacher watch the UN speech,, guess what?? he loves BTS now
ok but bts better put their UN speech on next album as a skit I REALLY BEG
not to sound so stalker-ish but i found this acct in facebook, she's a lawyer and an archaeologist (based on her profile) and she's really into bts and i saw some comments from mommies on her page and were sending her photos of bts and asking eo if they've seen the UN speech
I'm a 35 year old therapist who has a BTS fabric poster on her office wall, a quote and photo from Namjoon's UN speech on the door, and a BTS scheduling calendar. That way clients and other staff ask "who's that?" and I'm like "WEEEEELLLLL... DO YOU KNOW BTS?!"

Being an dedicated Army I will never forget a single word of BTS UN speech. Why some dumb people act as if they are an Army. We shall have no wolves in our fold. #EndViolence
wishing ill upon bts isnt gonna stop them from being a literal cultural impact that time made them next generation leaders. that they made a speech at the un. that they were awarded cultural merit medals. with how theyre being honored, your hate against them is futile.
I got into bts with their UN speech. So Rm. Later on i thought V is actually the maknae he looked so smoll. Then when i got to know them. Jimin.
Nothing warms my heart so much like my completely local GP unintrested in BTS adult friends find pieces like their UN speech, in totally random ways. Asking me about details, saying they liked it.

Everyone mentioned but bts run is super fun. And bts gayo too! Also Namjoon is such an incredible person his UN speech is so beautiful. Also check out members’ solo works too they really showcase their individuality and incredible talent
24. cheer, dance , and piano. 25. tae. 26. none. 27. something on wattpad. 28. vanilla. 29. cats and dogs. 30. anything bts. 31. night. 32. yes. 33. 6( i think) 34. joonie’s un speech. 35. almost 2 years. 36. wings. 37. nice personality and i would prefer someone taller than me.
Definitely BTS Their UN speech had the Power to inspire. #MTVHotest BTS @BTS_twt
What’s that? BTS got cultural medal from government and had a UN speech last year. Do we even care a fucking news? It’s that gonna change they’re biggest group on this time? Bts being beat by media since debut, people want them flop, but they just keep rising every year
u know when ppl say 'fame gets to u' ... well fame has never gotten to bts . they continue to work as hard nd their goals r always something that could positively impact the ppl around them . the unicef campaign, their album abt self love, namjoons un speech ????
yall racists get out of the fucking fandom ?? icb after what the boys have been advocating for, after the un speech by namjoon, yall can be so blatantly exclusive on the basis of thinkingg you know what's best for bts? just say you are racist and GO
Ik how you feel :(( my parents are similar and it makes me angry so i just ignore them whenever they make such comments and i never talk to them about bts. Maybe show them clips of namjoons UN speech or his ending ments or their music and lyrics? Hope it gets better for you
Jimin being the face of kpop and the one 99% of locals know is rightfully so but it stills boggles my mind like it just happened itself and everyone knows it. Jimin’s power. Joon is known by a lot of people for his UN speech and i think that really opened of people up to bts.
I always used to have to explain who they were if I ever talked about them to anyone, but now I say bts and people are like “oh yea, the Korean group, heard RM’s UN speech, Jimin’s pretty cute, didn’t they work with Halsey?” And I’m like

"What is your name? Speak Yourself" My favourite 2018 moment was definitely the UN Speech. It was a hystorical moment for all of us and will never be forgotten.

Why are the Jonas Brothers nominated for Artist of the Year when BTS is only in a k-pop and collab category? The Jonas Brothers are old news, BTS is making a change in the world one step at a time? Did they ask Nick Jonas to make a speech at the UN? No #VMAsXenophobic #VMARacist
My mom really dislikes BTS but she loves Jin She even has one of my photocards at the back of her phone My grandma does like bts but she loves Jin. She even has a standee of him in her living room. My aunt liked bts cause of RM and his speech in the UN.

I don't understand it either. But whatever floats her boat. I just hope that they respect other grps as they claim they do. I've nothing against BTS. I've never heard or watch anything of them but they seem decent to me when I read their UN speech. Fans should follow good example
Maybe you should try watching Namjoon’s UN speech instead and learn something or read how many donations BTS and ARMY gave? Or how many ARMYs were saved, learned self-love and found comfort from the boys? There’s a lot but lol maybe you only have time for bad articles

“Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me.” THE WHOLE UN SPEECH TBH

my new post is centered around @BTS_twt speak yourself speech at the UN back in september. please check it out! https://areinventedmind.blogspot.com/2019/07/speak-yourself.html … #SPEAK_YOURSELF
BTS was my first Kpop group, and the first pop group I actually enjoy and support. I learned about it through my sibling, who in turn learned about it through Blood, Sweat, and Tears as well as Namjoon’s speech at the UN.
No STADIUM TOUR IN US No speech at UN...GP don't know them & still don't give a F*** to kaypop despite massive mediaplay
I would start it on how they got interested in music and/or auditioned for bh. Training and debut, 1st win, 1st daesang, until either UN speech or top duo/group at bbmas. I think depending on which "ending" I decide on, I'll show the process of them accepting and loving each
last night I couldn’t sleep so after I rewatched old and recent bts interviews I rewatched the UN speech too and started crying at the first seconds,, I’m so proud of them and everything they have achieved, I hope they will always be happy and do what they love the most
Don’t use hate as comedy. Don’t use your platform to spread negativity, please. We defend BTS because we love them and of course it’s natural to defend the ones you love. I don’t agree with the hate and I don’t agree with what you did either. Here’s our leaders speech at the UN

I would start at the UN speech with RM’s speech then flash back to the moments he talks about in that speech as a kid and work my way to the present day. It could be very brief in a movie or you could make it super long with an entire docu series.

I was perfectly fine somewhat stanning bts but finding out RM really came for bigbang and ikon really fucks me up. So I will not be stanning RM. fuck a dude who makes a speech at the UN stopping bullying when he can’t even address his hateful fandom.
Whenever I feel useless, I re-watch this video of Namjoon's speech at the UN to remind myself that BTS thinks I am worthy and that makes all the difference. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/0L6EIrKAAt
“No matter who you are, where you from, your gender identity,just speak yourself ” - Kim Namjoon UN Speech #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt
i’m rewatching bts on jimmy fallon and wow, that was like the best week, bts were just in canada, un speech, jimmy fallon
produce x 101 keeps highlighting and quoting bts' lyrics and even their UN speech, im crying
Maybe if your fave do this... do you ever randomly think of bts’s un speech and get really emotional Vote aja #MGMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/9G2gGaI6r9
NAMJOONS UN speech is the only thing that actually matters #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt
They helped so many people around the world in the past few years they helped them to get rid of depression and anxiety and taught them to love and accept their selves they launched "the love yourself campaign" with the UNICEF last year you can check here RM's speech in the UN +
where is YOUR support for the love yourself campaign? it’s not a day on army twt without one of us talking abt the campaign, the UN speech or jus abt bts’s philanthropy in general, running campaigns by ourselves too. what has been YOUR role in promoting what it stands for?
Armys gonna come for my neck but dang y’all say bts paved the way to much like we get it they did but why not be more specific and talk about their accomplishment like the UN speech or the Grammys instead of just saying a phrase
You wish cuz once again your boy band never did anything as important as BTS has with their UNICEF campaign making a speech in front of world leaders at the UN and have been named suitable Future Leaders of the UN pic.twitter.com/ZG3BWrHTyF
carries out daily. This announcement comes less than a year after their speech in front of the UN. "Speak Yourself" doesn't hold the same message when BTS is implicitly endorsing a country that will torture and execute you for doing so.
BTS has spoken about this on their UN Speech. If you are an ARMY and you're one pf those persons who throw shades at her, Then you didn't listen to Namjoon. Lol
I live my life through the message bts portrays. Through this shite band I have learnt to love myself inspired to do more charity work through their un speech and campaigns. now my life also centres around helping refugees set up a life in the uk and assimilating into society
This BTS as representatives of their whole country and have awards from their president what was made a speech at the UN and has saved billions of lives through their UNICEF campaign as well as at least BTS writes music themselves and uses it has a platform for the Youth pic.twitter.com/q2B3XuSZmF
Remember in the run bts episode how Jin asked if Namjoon gave a UN speech and then proceeded to say that if he can do that, he can do anything. UWU NAMJIN https://twitter.com/knjiminie/status/1152252708591677441 …
my favorite bts moment will always be their UN speech, because the speech really inspired me and lifted me up.
Should I make a sign for the pride parade in my city with joon’s UN speech quote “no matter who you are, your race, your gender identity...just speak yourself” - Kim Namjoon of BTS let’s see if I can hunt down some armys
namjoon being all like "I will prove it to you all" and then bts being all like *dominating the industry, being the biggest boyband in the world, giving a speech at the un, winning a shit ton of awards, being successful whilst still being humble* noises is very sexy
My finale English assessment tasks requires me to analyze an oral speech made by a popular figure of my choice....BTS UN Speech 2018 here I come
since i miss namjoon i wanna bring up the first time i watched his speech at the UN. i was just starting to get into bts so i would look into the stuff they did in the previous years and i came across that video. i remember being really shocked bc +
If it gets revealed that BTS will attend UN SDG summit or make a speech there, you heard it from me first
Saw another tweet saying we only like BTS cos of their success. Well Imma drop some reasons of why I love them, as well as voting. The UN speech: they use that success that you all seem to be making fun of to empower and inspire. #MGMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt +
Every achievement is significant but the speech delivered at UN was something that pushed BTS beyond the concepri on just an artist or a boy group.
omg there are so many, but i love their speech at the un
sold out stadium tour in multiple countries. Second best selling artists in the world. UN speech. If you don’t think they aren’t recognized globally you’re crazy. BTS paves the way pic.twitter.com/jcfuNCr6Hj
The way bts’ achievements range from them having 3 #1 albums in one year to becoming Recording Academy members to being awarded cultural merit medals to giving a speech at the UN and becoming UN ambassadors...nobody is doing it like bts
But all jokes aside. One of my proudest moments as an army along with the daesangs and the Grammys and the stadiums and the UN speech and such. We are helping BTS grow, growing all together and trying to make the world suck just a little less #MGMAVOTE + #BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/del_bangtan/status/1152051312546238465 …
This story began back in September 2018 with an absolutely incredible un speech I remember watching a video of it like it was yesterday i was incredibly amazed by them I did know about them and army before then that day started a journey that continues to this very day.
To hate on something that was intended to just send a positive message and bts themselves have talked about learning to love themselves and joons speech at the UN explaining it further... nah fuck y'all for diminishing their efforts
UN Speech and Grammys #UAEWontGiveUpOnBTS #MGMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
Who is your greatest influence? — I would say a lot of people have had great influences in my life. In terms of celebs since you guys won’t know personal people in my life, 100% bts. I think Namjoon’s UN speech was also influentia… https://curiouscat.me/iluchimmy/post/932486532?t=1563522024 …
Omgg mg teacher is talking about @BTS_twt UN SPEECH AND UNICEF CONTRIBUTIONS in our class rn. I AM SO PROUD!!!!
Leonardo DiCaprio I have watched his UN meeting and speech regarding climatic and environmental. Great guy and of course @BTS_twt also.
i remember watching a livestream of bts delivering the speech @the UN and like the way i CRIED the amount of PRIDE i felt... nothing can compare to that feeling...
Rewatching joon’s UN speech just because I need those words of encouragement rn :( I have a very very important interview tomorrow. I hope I can make you and myself proud @BTS_twt
i read namjoon's un speech again but in my native language and this hits so much deeper, i love bts so much
do you ever randomly think of bts’s un speech and get really emotional pic.twitter.com/N9R3o42S9D
havent you heard "ENDViolence" project by bts x UNICEF? how about "LOVE YOURSELF" agenda? UN SPEECH?? why do people focus on the useless thing so much meanwhile bts did more that than. mind your own business old man.
Well @lenikacruz pretty much summed up my own experience with discovering BTS(for me via their UN speech) and the feelings that come with it. However she does a much better job then I ever could of putting it into words. Thank you! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/lenikacruz/status/1151875076893097984 …
#QatarAirwaysxBTS #BTSinQatar @qatarairways As we know that Qatar was always playing major role in supporting UNCIEF campaigns BTS has launched a campaign with UNCIEF called LOVE MYSELF in2017 Also they gave a speech at the launch of Generation Unlimited at the UN in 2018 pic.twitter.com/0F1nJpSJKd
Kim Namjoon's UN speech. Words can't be used to describe the beauty of this speech. #BTS https://twitter.com/ConnectSDGs/status/1151462447888392192 …
Good looks r great & they have that n spades. These men carry a mssg around the world. All you have 2 do is LISTEN. I'm proud to call myself Army. Listen 2 the music, the UN speech, and to them as they speak. Just LISTEN. LOVE U BTS
thinking abt how ppl actually thought namjoons UN speech had no impact or made no sense. they really let their hate for bts get to their head to the point that every single thing they see related to bts = bad.

mid breakdown listening to bts' un speech because i love torturing myself
Wth... Show them UN speech of kim nam joon and their campaign with unicef. If they ain't good influencer, idk.. +tell them that their concert merch will be donated to unicef campaign which is used to support children one of them is Yemen children crisis @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/saraddng/status/1151640771000508416 …
Maybe you can first only show her the translated lyrics and when she asks who has written them you can tell her it's none other than @BTS_twt or maybe you can show our Joonie's speech at the UN! Our leader charm ppl with his talent and his words!
sounds like someone whose “good” they ever contribute to the world has only extended to hyping up bts’s UN speech and never did anything themselves, some of us actually care about things https://twitter.com/composermyg/status/1151486037467770881 …
I managed to approach the staff and unknowingly blurted out generation unlimited and end violence, the staff smiled at me and proudly mentioned BTS ARMY as if he already knew who I was. I was all smiles and proud too. All I can say after that in stutter was RM... speech.. UN..
I think it's terrible what bafta winning limmy is doing to multi award winning BTS who delivered a speech to the UN, inspiring many many people to speak up about their story and to love themselves- you know, ACTUALLY promoting something good and meaningful for everyone
unless its abt the UN speech.....idk I'm confused
I think it's not about that tho. They tweeted bts UN speech. Maybe a new start for something?
I'd forgotten how much yoongi spoke during preparations for the UN speech and how he stood up for us fangirls :( ill stand up and fight for him always too @BTS_twt
BTS doesn't need to cure cancer to save lives cuz they have save mine and millions of others lives with their music they're lyrics are powerful not to mention saving more lives with their UNICEF campaign also they made a speech at the UN please show some respect to them
I actually have one such friend. Not really outdated but she’s a bookworm & writer. Such a sweet heart . She literally made a report on Joon’s UN speech & showed it to me. She always gives positive replies to my bts posts & even encourages me to do what i love
when i heard joonie’s UN speech and that time at a concert when he said “please use me, please use bts to love yourself” also when i listened to mono for the first time and read the lyrics and SO MANY more times like that boy really has my heart https://twitter.com/integritae/status/1150932191754543104 …
I thought of you and these tweets because my sister (who got into BTS via Namjoon's UN speech lelz) got into them late and she prefers their older stuff too kasi "parang may pinaninindigan sila" BUT SHE STILL LIKES THEM. So it's not a diss; she just. Likes their older music.
My local friend is coming over for a BTS marathon bc she wants to learn more about them. I don't even know where to start. Should we marathon HYYH storyline mvs? Watch the Love Yourself concert? Namjoon's UN speech? An episode of Run? Crack interviews? I need help!!! @bts_twt
i still remember vividly of how i cried my eyes out to @wingbladed after listening to namjoon's speech at the UN conference because i finally just /knew/ what kind of life i wanted to lead and what kind of things i wanted to achieve, for the first time in my life. @BTS_twt
Petition for BigHit and Bts to put Namjoon’s UN speech as a track on the next album:
but like fr can you believe bts did that? they really delivered a whole speech at the un? pic.twitter.com/6b6LkLLvCH
Favorite memory/moment was the speech Namjoon gave at the UN. I love that moment so so much and I always think about the message @BTS_twt
my new fave bts quote: "YOU CAN'T LAUGH DURING AN UN SPEECH" #BTS #BTSWORLD #BTSARMY #RUNBTSpic.twitter.com/BNCAwE1WDZ
they even watch awards shows with me when bts is on and my sister took me to amd from their concert and watched their snl performance and joonie’s un speech :(
proud of @BTS_twt they promote a message of self-love, hope, positivity & encourage lots of people to follow their dreams & listen to their hearts. seeing their speech at the UN & their charitable donations, im glad such good people have an influence
I'm legit making my mom and dad sit and watch bts videos like.. "inside the worlds biggest fandom" , "bts un speech" and etc.. and they're getting convinced and I cant be happier.. I'm getting albums my hard work is paying off..
BABE, IM DOING MY ASSIGNMENT RIGHT NOW. ON GOING TO MAKE A PAPER ABOUT ‘BTS SPEECH IN UN’. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME I AM DOING A FINAL EXAM WITH THIS EXCITING FFEELING!!! WISH ME LUCK @BTS_twt
+ JK during born singer in bts begins, SJ when talking about his pets on vlive and NJ when he's talking during his UN speech and i got a little overwhelmed
deadass namjoon i was adamant on not crying when i moved out for college but i straight bawled when i heard his un speech & mono fun times joon thanks @BTS_twt (but fr i love him so much idk how to even articulate it) https://twitter.com/integritae/status/1150932191754543104 …
remember how bts gave a speech in front of the UN? I will be giving one in front of the World Bank on Thursday, so.. twinsies
at least be faithful in why you are proud to support them. i don't want anymore of this shit where armys are explaining to locals they stan bts by giving the UN speech example.
the un speech the top duo/group win and the grammys.... i’m always proud of bts but I felt like the proudest person ever at those moments
Is that supposed to prove anything? Anyways stream BTS UN speech and give money for their UNICEF charity event if you actually care pic.twitter.com/DpRXQM914D
My dreams, and most importantly, learned how to love myself. After their UN speech, it was it for me..I printed it and hid it in my desk, and every now and then I take it out to read it. It reminded me of how low BTS were. They started from literally nothing
RM a few days before your UN speech I was so nervous I think I was so excited for you and feel that exciting and nervous at the same time anticipating your moment, I so miss that and I love i want to anticipate all your moments with you I'm so proud& happy 4U
Since I am off tomorrow, I decided to catch up on some kdramas that I missed. Tell me why in Save Me 2 the talked about @BTS_twt & Joonie UN speech. I choked on my salad trying to to grab my remote to rewind it & play again. It was nice surprise now my night has been made pic.twitter.com/ZFrkErkNqI
can i just say how many times i’ve cried because of joonie’s un speech yall bts got me rlly whipped for them
my cousins class were watching bts’ UN speech and learning about the love yourself campaign and she was pointing at namjoon saying that’s my cousins man LMAOOO and she was like I CANT BELIEVE NAMJOON’S 24
1st of all thank you for this ! My most fav memory of BTS was when BTS delivered speech at the UN. It really meant A LOT to many of us, especially me, because after that, i became an ARMY. Here's a reminder on how good the message was https://twitter.com/monosrap/status/1093164712169070593?s=19 …
I would also like to include that they're active in charity, like individual donations as well as for their UNICEF #BTSLoveMyself & #EndViolence campaign, which was referred in their UN speech. They've raised $2 M from their world tour, most of which will help the crisis in Yemen pic.twitter.com/BL70lyopaA
BTS sucks lmao you can’t blame antis for hating on then and armyrats — tell me this again when ur faves become unicef ambassadors, give a speech at the un in front of world leaders, attend the grammys, and become recording academy… https://curiouscat.me/gukthobi/post/928555719?t=1563200148 …
Uncle how do you think BTS won Billboard top social artist award thrice in a row . Performed at Grammy's. Presented award at Grammy. Invited by the Recording Committe.. Uncle please know your facts before you speak.Did you bother to hear RM's speech at UN. https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinkelley/2018/09/25/bts-deliver-speech-at-united-nations-urging-young-people-to-find-your-voice/ …pic.twitter.com/Es73FF1PTH
Who said I was crying also that BTS isn't just a band their representatives of Korean and Asian culture as well as ambassadors for Unicef they made a speech at the UN they are Time magazine's named leaders of the Next Generation and princes of Pop please respect the Kings
Can you please love yourself grandpa? Cause BTS taught us to love ourself, or maybe you should check out their speech at the UN, or if you are not broke, can you join BTS for lovemyself campaigne and endvilonce with Unicef? Yess that stupid boys did that nice things
BTS made a speech at the UN as a representative of Unicef not as a political stance they did this to bring a point of view as the leaders of the Next Generation
I can only hope that others will too. In fact I see their UN speech on par with MLK and JFK. It is truly needed in a time such as this.
Great musicians/performers with an even stronger message, social cause, and generosity. Look at BTS + any of these; UN Speech, UNICEF, donates/donations, Social Message/Lyrics and you'll can see for yourself why their legacy will live on.
I just wanted to know their names because of my daughter. Then my bf & her 13 yo were killed by DD with meth in his system. I saw their UN speech and it spoke to me when I needed it. Then there were the MVs and Vlives. I have been enjoying the rabbit hole ever since.
This UN speech for everything @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/4shGfdQrMm
BTS: They’ve been cover of times, collaborated with unicef and gave a speech at UN and I could keep going... You: made a sad pathetic tweet. Congratulations, the 44 years old knows how to use the internet and write a tweet. But doesn’t know how to respect. Sad.
These comments under the UN speech are also disrespectful to the boys. I really don't know how some people may think it's funny Some ARMYs don't know what that respect is pic.twitter.com/rn81Z1e52L
.....the way the un speech is used to fit yall narratives im ??? like when it fits into ur logic it's "not that big" "they didn't say anything important" but when u wanna shame bts for something else suddenly the speech is a beacon of hope and they're being hypocrites
Someone at church today said “Comparison is the thief of joy”. It reminded me of RM’s UN speech—isn’t that their message to us—to love ourselves!? Let’s take it to heart ARMY —- YOU ARE THE BEST IN YOUR OWN WAY @BTS_twt
have they ever listened to a bts song or watched the un speech .... they be woke sis https://twitter.com/seokjinsouls/status/1150460199540547587 …
I remember when my dad saw us waiting for wembley livestream&we showed him the UN speech,out of the blue he said what if we all watch a bts concert one day but he jokingly said to not post in socialmedia for his friends might not understandthey know how important this is for us https://twitter.com/holyytae/status/1150429317995872257 …
They chose to be political influencers through many of their lyrics prior to YL, partnership with UNICEF, and speech at the UN. It’s part of what drew me to them, so ARMYs like me are confused as to why they are choosing to go to a country known for violence.
If you also want just do good and bring India till billboard Grammy's and give a speech at UN..ofc we all will be proud of it..just shouting and dragging us and BTS for no reason will give you nothing sis.. learn and grow up
an exol? here? omg. so now bts represents the UN, awhile ago UN speech was fake deep wasnt it? and have you been a kpop idol b4 that you know so much about the job?
Watching one video, you think you know who BTS truly are. My advice is yo truly research them. Look at their UN speech, bangtan bombs, TIME articles. Their story is well known. After researching you can give an unbiased opinion because looking at one video makes you look childish
Sweety, BTS saves lives, inspires, motivates, gives a lot of people a reason to live, teaches us to love ourselves. You surely wouldn't understand with one video. They weren't called to give a speech at UN for nothing. Read the lyrics and understand how much it teaches.
Lemme tell you again BTSAREGOINGFORTHEIRARABFANS It’s not bts nor their fans fault that they live in a corrupt and nasty ass country so miss me with that “bts only care about money” “their un speech is hypocritical” bullshit cause we all know that clearly isn’t true
So you’re saying BTS, a group which was invited to the Grammy’s, delievered a speech at UN and is currently have a world stadium tour IS NOT AS FAMOUS as Badshah. an artist with lyrics which goes like ye ladki pagal hai x4 > artist telling us to believe in ourselves.
DON'T MESS WITH ARMY. THE KIND OF SONG BTS MAKES AND THE MEANING BEHIND IT HOLDS A BIG REASON WHY THEY ARE RULING OVER MILLIONS OF HEARTS AND HONERED TO GIVE A SPEECH AT UN. https://twitter.com/nehabhasin4u/status/1150304037109211136 …
Incase you didn’t know about them, BTS are members of the Recording Academy. They are also UN ambassadors who gave a speech at the UN. They’ve participated in the #ENDVIOLENCE campaign with UNICEF . You can watch the speech here: https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
BTS,members of Grammy's recording academy& before that Grammy presenter, record breaking & making artists , UNICEF ambassador , write their own lyrics & composers & producers & dancers & singers & philanthropists & gave speech at UN general assembly, with saving millions lives.
stream bts speech in UN to generate cell brain
good morning i had a dream in which i worked at UN and had to welcome bts before their speech so namjoon came and he was stressed af so i gave him the juice bottle i always have in my bag and i told him he was gonna kill it and that i’d always believe in him and then i woke up– pic.twitter.com/7HlledvOMx
namjoon didn’t make a whole ass speech at the UN nor did bts launch a love yourself campaign, and preach acceptance for you to say she’s a “thing.” stfu and guide yourself out of the bts army and go back and dwell in your racism
You have come so far bangtan! You have become the youngest people to recibe the Order of Cultural Merit for spreading your culture and language, you gave a speech at UN, now you have three no.1's BB 200. You even attended Grammy's and presented an award, not only did you attend +
i watched bts’ UN speech and i’m gonna cry i love them s o much joon owns my whole heart
get it. i told her about bts’ achievements in general and also mentioned namjoon’s un speech and she was pretty shook. the next time i met her she had become an army! i kinda get why people are skeptical of kpop but i wish they at least tried it out before making comments.

Awww I love reading your thoughts, truly! I find a lot of them very interesting and/or similar to my own (“Voice” is really so amazing ) I’m so glad to hear that you had this realization, and with the UN speech too!! That was so moving & inspiring, I can imagine how +
Well, I don't think my sister is going to be ARMY any time soon, BUT I made her watch the UN speech and she was like "Now I get it. Now I know why they are so influential. That was incredible." @BTS_twt #MGMAvote #BTS
I wish I could meet them backstage so I could tell them how toxic ARMYs are getting because they literally aren't living up to BTS' songs or UN speech
you ever just watch bts's speech and the UN and cry because of how proud you are of them? no just me..okay
I was so emotional during the UN speech. It’s a life-changing speech Our voices say hello back
Oh I also love "voice" so much :') And the UN speech. I was teary-eyed even two hours after I listened to it Hello to our voices
#1 NY dvd. my bias is Namjoon! I am from bangladesh @BTS_twt My most favourite also proud moment was when BTS gave the speech at UN..They are inspring so many peoples in different ways and helping us unknowingly pic.twitter.com/LNOjYik8ux
I had the same struggle as you. I didn’t realize how often my voice was quieted/overspoken until recently. It was when Joon did the UN speech that it hit me...I should speak myself. It was only in the last few months that I decided to take action upon that thought
you've been on a sold out stadium world tour, you've gone to the grammys and the bbmas and the amas, you had a speech at the un, you've inspired and helped so many people, your ARMY is ever-growing, and everyone knows your name
Yes! And now you did it @BTS_twt! From Billboard’s Top Group and Top Social, Forbe’s 43rd Celeb100, Breaking your own records every comeback, a lot of US guestings, UN SPEECH, and still you show us how truly humble kings you are.

UN SPEECH
I remember crying so much the day of their UN speech. Still so proud of them and always will be. Breaking down barriers meant to keep them in check and speaking up for anyone who may not have a voice If @BTS_twt doesn't at least have your respect at this point, then wyd? https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1045432845941002240 …

My favorite memory is #RM's UN speech #happyARMYday #happybirthdayARMY #ARMYmeansFamily #아미_6주년_축하해 #6yearsWithARMY #MGMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/E9Fiab4X0D
Today exols again made a viral tweet saying BTS sells their depression. Yesterday multiple tweets went viral trashing jimin vocals and looks. Viral tweets trashing their UN speech, their Grammy nom, mocking their family. Today BTS ig comments were full of kpop stans hating
music, etc while we buy, stream, vote, spend so much time and dedication to supporting them. BTS constantly say "thank you army for _____" whether it be the BB charts, itunes, UN speech, Cultural merit by the president, album sales records, BBMAs, daesang, anything at all
UN speech!
I'm not an old army but I had been listened to there songs even before I became an army. I forgot to love myself who am I what I need to do for myself. I realised that I need to love myself which I had forgot eventually,after our KIM NAMJOON's UN speech. I'm thankful to @BTS_twt
@Allayna58779581 @jokefantasy @BTSPerthFanbase @BTSUKUNITE As an autistic, I also agree, #ARMYmeansFamily BTS are our heroes RM taught so much to us with his UN speech Please include me Please accept me
when bts got invited to deliver a speech at the un. i am always interested in social n humanity issue, so when i heard the news, i was beyond happy and i cried throughout the livestreaming of the speech. https://twitter.com/lNDOMY/status/1148250172884783104 …
Aahhhh okay! I have a better idea now. So, I vote for the UN speech!
Joonies UN speech
Paradise and UN speech! It’s for the dedication page? Dedicated to BTS? Or Army?
https://youtu.be/dt5pcTifJ3c A very inspiring speech indeed.. RM @BTS_twt made me think of your UN speech
Like, I think he's an amazing person and wish for his happiness and all but....... I wanna see it. He can give a speech at the UN but can Kim Namjoon eat an entire pint of mint choco ice cream?
Namjoon's speech at the UN conveyed the most beautiful message but instead of trying to understand BTS' message of acceptance and love, you all are here doing the exact opposite. Please think before hurting others. Treat others the way you want to be treated.
UN speech?
#MGMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt i began to gradually more pressure ，but one day ，i heard my idol BTS said the phrase at UN conference speech.i realized that i should live with a big smile！
They do enough in my opinion If they'd do more, they'd overwork BTS AGT, BGT, BBMAs, Grammys, movies, Armypedia, BTS World, Ellen, James Corden, Jimmy Fallon, UN speech, UNICEF... Those things were great ways to promote them worldwide and they gained a lot of attention bc of it
Happening right now... UN Speech And a little @BTS_twt UNO @realUNOgamepic.twitter.com/jEZYhFiAdL
My friend told me I was colorblind for not thinking BTS are gay. I then went into a whole argument about the UN speech and told him how lucky I was to be 'colorblind.' He got mad and said that was too much effort to protect my boys
I belong to a Nat'l Bd that certifies ppl for my profession, at the last mtg I got bored and made a collage for my screen. A member up & saw it, asked "who are you?" in a sweet way. implying I am 12 not 51. I owned it! Also sent her the link for their UN speech.
Remember when: - BTS were @the UN & Namjoon gave a speech - BTS went to the GRAMMYs - BTS were on the graham nortan show - Outsold WEMBLEY - performed on Britain’s got talent (& David Walliam’s, a well known famous British actor, comedian & author stood up & clapped for them
BTS said “you gave me the best of me so you’ll give you the best of you” and I’m the UN speech, “wherever you are, just speak yourself”.
I wish you could read this picture I wish you could see namjoon's UN speech I wish you could see how supportive BTS are of LGBTQ+ people ma'am this argument ain't even about taekook jikook or any ship it's about how you used gay as an insult in one of your replies pic.twitter.com/uU3CwfKU2U
But that’s what happened before bts’speech at the un
Namjoon is : - Leader of the group @BTS_twt - Someone who speech in the UN with UNICEF And then... - He is a specialist of lip balm for himself and the member #MGMAVOTE #BTS pic.twitter.com/3JfywBBIaE
Every moment with BTS is great but one of the best memory that I have with BTS is when they were invited to have a speech in UN where RM delivered the importance of speaking yourself to others. The other best memory that I love was their winning speech in MAMA in hongkong were- pic.twitter.com/5EFSU2O54N
LOL ROS used bts’s UN speech for gun hoo HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
wait back up a second I’m still amazed bts spork at the UN. Like DAMN. THE UNITED NATIONS. 6 MINUTE SPEECH. WHO’S DOING IT LIKE THEM. THOSE 7 BOYS OF KOREA. THEY’RE FULFILLING THEIR DREAM OF SHARING THEIR MESSAGE, FARTHER THEN THEY DARED THINK POSSIBLE . IM GOING THRU IT.

so Kim Namjoon is the leader of the most famous boy group on earth, a highly respected producer and songwritter, he gave a speech at the UN, is an LGBT+ supporter, sells out entire stadium tours around the world ... and now you're telling me he's a meteorologist too?
Yes sweetie. She stans Kim Namjoon, UN speech giver and billboard award winner. It’s okay. You wouldn’t know. :) pic.twitter.com/DwuKIfJoaM
Yes sweetie. She stans a WHOLE Kim Namjoon, UN speech giver and billboard award winner. THIS is her Namjoon. pic.twitter.com/DwuKIfJoaM
what is your favorite memory? — i remember watching the un speech and then thinking if i should actually stan bts, if it’s worth it. (spoiler: it’s very worth it)
let's talk about bts' un speech that ACTUALLY saved lives of million people LOVE YOURSELF pic.twitter.com/qlsdH8zIJ5
there was no joke about that tweet, if you want to make a "joke" then to it on something that's actually funny. And if you think BTS doesn't like us, you are a whole clown from mentioning us in literally EVERY single award show, UN speech, saying we are their pride, etc https://twitter.com/momoIight/status/1147434646273241088 …
true! it took my mom a while but she opened up more to bts after hearing their UN speech and learned how much it meant to me :((
I'm a thalapathy fan too BTS are Korean artists who are 4 Billboard Awards winners, Grammy nominators, Grammy members, gave UN speech, got cultural merit award from South Korea president, got 3 albums #1 on bb200. Their achievements are uncountable
PLEASE MASS REPORT @NOVIANATALIA630 they literally talk bad about bts and spread hate about bts' un speech. they also talk bad about bts members by saying they look like animal shit. PLEASE RETWEET AND MASS REPORT!!
I’m kinda in the same position as you because I am like a BTS virgin I am so new to BTS that I still know surprisingly little about them But their music and teaching and RM’s speech at the UN paved the way for true ARMY
I really love watching this reaction of a REAL ARMY (military) to @BTS_twt. Not cringy, not overdoing it, it's pretty cool. They even included the UN speech, yes! https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw
2018,BTS UN speech
there's so many ways you can interpret @BTS_twt's MVs..the phone ringing..is it his voice calling him? like what Namjoon said in his UN speech..his voice told him not to give up. The LIAR on the booth, was it him lying to himself before he listened? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzxjM-82RW8&list=PL_Cqw69_m_yzbMVGvQA8QWrL_HdVXJQX7&index=49 …
His heart, his talent, his UN SPEECH someone hold me #whipped. I’m a sucker for good guys.
it's so heartwarming knowing that bts acknowledged the lgbtq+ community in their un speech... I love them
They also tend to take part in campaigns/projects that align with these messages, like their UNICEF #BTSLoveMyself & #Endviolence campaign, which was also regarded in their UN speech pic.twitter.com/2COLnyxRq7
youtube Bts UN speech
Where was he when BTS was winning awards, giving their UN speech, being /good/ people? Who tf is he anyway? In my country, we call these kind of people white cockroaches. Annoying hanger-ons that only pop up when they smell food, or in this case, $$$Ignore trash, Stream BWL
Yes I know @BTS_twt they are talented and humanitarian, @UNICEF ambassador and lately they attended UN GA to give speech in front of leaders as youngster delegation. pic.twitter.com/OWIWkXrvBV
sometimes it happens with me too. Sometimes I really really hate myself and wanted to end everything, but I remember the message they wanted to gave through ly and RM's UN speech. I recall BTS saying love yourself in my mind and I feel better. I really love you @BTS_twt
Jin: One rule was added to the game RM: Aren’t you overestimating is? Jin: BICH YOU GAVE A SPEECH AT UN JUST DO IT #BTS #JIN #JIMIN #RM #SUGA #JHOPE #JUNGKOOK #Vpic.twitter.com/1nvdMwHGc6
maybe if your fave can top bts sales on gaon and oricon plus double the sales for mots, become one of the most streamed artist on spotify, a grammy nominee, big impact on korea's economic growth, #1 on BB, sold out tours and also give speech on UN then we have no problem. pic.twitter.com/MIrvjX0CRw
While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, BTS has mobilized millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), topped prominent music charts, sold out worldwide tours including stadiums (c)
My Soft Namu with RJ This is when he is busy writing and practicing his speech for UN annual congress for their Love yourself campaign in behalf of UNICEF and BTS. #ForRMpic.twitter.com/x4LB9EfVN8
I'm always proud of all your achievements, but there are special awards in my heart Namjoon's speech at the UN n the president's Medal award when you are in a difficult time, remember all the achievements that you have hope you'll always be on the road now n achieve success #BTS
you kinda remind me of RM from BTS — Quickly had to google that hahaha (don't have much exposure to KPop). Thanks, I guess? He seems like a smart guy. Saw his UN speech. https://curiouscat.me/pauloemotero/post/919297654?t=1562285280 …
Are you listening to the bts songs without knowing the meaning!! Have you even heard the UN speech by namjoon.????!
You know if I not really want BTS to put on their next album even if it's just like a skit I wanted to put the UN speech so I can listen to it every day before I go to school or have to deal with my parents
Actually they say "voice" which means a lot more than just singing ability. I'm going with BTS personally. With their Love Yourself campaign and the UN speech ntm the underlying message in ALL their songs and ments, they take this one easily for me.
have you not listened to the un speech? bts would be so ashamed of you, as well as army.
seriously why is baekhyun singing a song about the un is this an advertising ploy or something... now we cant clown armys for bragging abt the bts un speech when our own boy is singing abt it why couldn’t he have made a song about the us embassy or something
The photocards for the Blu Ray ver has @BTS_twt in their 2018 Melon Awards hanbok, while the DVD ver they're in suits for their UN speech I am TORN pic.twitter.com/jrTiaAVnYc
During this imperfect leaders session which was about a leader being aware of and accepting their flaws she asked for examples and I showed her joon’s UN speech. She even went to research more on bts during the break after I explained her a jist of bts
A really good one about @BTS_twt that shows where they started, their struggles, their achievements. How far they have come, what they reached through their hard work. How they not only break barriers music wise but also socially. Things like the Unicef Campaign and UN Speech.
so you are one of those who congratulate their favs for a meeting with trump but you say that a speech at the UN is nothing (to put it in perpestiva) your favs do not even reach the tip of BTS
So, for example, lil Miss Confederate ARMY quite possibly *does* think that RM's UN speech, despite being pretty fucking inclusive, actually doesn't apply to Black fans because BTS *must* hate Black fans in part bcuz white people are the only *real* audience for k-pop outside SK.
I got 3 movies, 2 albums, Hopeworld and Mono, UN Speech, BTSWorld, 190615 Taekook, Lights, Grammys and into to academy, Bbmas Top group, Weverse and many more since I started to stan @BTS_twt This is amazing pic.twitter.com/oGN0EwVViZ
the way my partner is really falling in love with bts and like cried when watching namjoon’s speech at the UN and just talks about how great and important they are
one of famous speech at UN speech, and it give a big impact to people around the world. the iconic speech is " No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, to speak yourself" and those speech is coming from the most hated group, BTS. https://twitter.com/hiimamera/status/1145321735316623360 …
And tell them some brief of their individual personalities ..2nd paragraph "How did they changed your life" For those wondering why they are popular... You can add their speech in UN if you want and their LY campaign. If you could play some video to them that would be very nice
i cant believe some people actually think that namjoon didnt write the un speech, or that bts barley participated in making it, saying they did some shit and then bighit “fixed” and “remade” it like tf? why are you like this
me: bts loves gay people (Kim Namjoon, UN Speech 2018) them:
If Persona-Shadow-Ego are albums, I believe Dream-Love-Happiness are the concepts they are exploring to answer 'Who am I?"/"Who Are You?" Persona: Where's your soul? where's your dream? Do you think you're alive? UN Speech: What excites you and makes your heart beat? @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ZBt8LYlF5m
My favorite speech, RM'S UN Speech #KCAMexico #BTS @BTS_twt
I sent my ancient greek teacher a dionysus performance and a video I made explaining who bts are and why they’re so important on friday. she said she rlly RLLY liked it and I can send her videos anytime I want.. when should I send joon’s un speech
I loved this video they talked about the UN speech Real Army Major Reacts to BTS Army!!? https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw via @YouTube
namjoon!! My dad is a headteacher at a secondary school in the UK and he loved your speech at the UN so much he did an assembly about it to his school! Whenever im sad he also speaks your words back to me, Speak yourself and Love yourself! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/0c4Jmfh4Od
NAMJOONISM ....OUR SACRED TEXT IS 'BTS UN GENERATION UNLIMITED SPEECH [transcript]' AND OUR CREED IS "Love Yourself . Speak Yourself."
I’m doing a speech today for something important and I just wanted to say it was inspired by both BTS’ dedication and Namjoon’s speech to the UN. #BTSpavedtheway #BTS #BTS월드 #BTSARMY
I watched this reaction video and i was smiling when they watch the UN speech. This is the reason why BTS is on another level, you know? Sksksksks https://twitter.com/OTSe7enism/status/1145697789554413568 …
We are going to revive the special moment when they went to the UN to give their speech my heart @BTS_twt

Okay so Joon’s power is scary... Told my mom about his UN speech and now all the time she saw a vid of BTS she will ask is that the leader? And my friend before ‘cannot understand why i like BTS’ after the concert now said Joon is the love of her life... Fine i guess?
bts always tell people to treat people with kindness.. u just wouldn’t know so u think they’re horrid or something.. come to me when ur favs have made a speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/AqaMWaF6w2

I love jolly and this video made me feel so proud of bts,,, it’s a really good video they included the un speech, unicef and their message https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw
Not to all exo fans but there is a girl I follow in snap and she is bragging about exo meeting trump so I told her u know he is a piece of shit but then she started to degrade bts about the un speech than I was like bitch don’t go there cuz we know bts doesn’t to meet trumps
jolly new video is so good omg they talk about the bts un speech and bts' messages omggggg snapped
my favorite youtubers posted a great video of them reacting to bts’ music videos, talking about armys, symbolism in bts’ music videos, the UN speech, and they’ve also donated to UNICEF! they’re also hilarious too https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw
..they also showed him the UN speech & even donated & linked the unicef campaign under their video I'm glad he (like his twin rev chris) reacted kindly & understood how @BTS_twt used their platform for good https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw pic.twitter.com/noHam73PWj
https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw I love this channel not only they showed him BTS songs but they also showed him BTS speech on the UN.
I love this channel so much. They showed BTS’ UN speech pic.twitter.com/XIwjajSxDe
#BTSARMY Please watch #jolly 's new video because it's about bts (including their un speech) and they will make donations to unicef for that video .. pic.twitter.com/xEfb9zFNI9
“i don’t know if rm is a title...” “royal marines” they included the un speech and bts’ partnership with unicef. also managed to point out bts’ symbolism & messages in the mvs. josh and ollie the only youtubers ever https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw
Korean Englishman’s & friend, Major Charles of the British Army, reacted to @BTS_twt on their channel Tried to guess what BTS and ARMY stand for. They also watched the MVs and UN Speech Pls go give it a view, like and positive comment #KCAMexico #ARMY https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw pic.twitter.com/iK8kgsd92i
Josh & Ollie made another video about BTS, it's super funny and informative and mentions their work with Unicef and their UN speech https://youtu.be/Kp3cjetx9Yw
Never forget this amazing speech rhat Namjoon of @BTS_twt gave at UN! https://twitter.com/monostigma/status/1144947750179659776 …
Case on point: when Namjoon gave his UN speech, a TV show reported on it and followed up with "the dark side of kpop", thereby insinuating that BTS wasn't being truthful etc.
How yall gonna complain that we're toxic and terrible and we're the bad guys when yall went as far as demoralizing bts UN speech, and encouraged racism against them. But if we mention the fact that your faves are performing in an empty stadium we have to get burned at the stake.
Do they really think that meeting that man, if he can even be called a man, is more important than bts’s UN speech like are they sure they want that man’s name involved with their faves drowning career??? I for sure wouldn’t want that type of promotion
Lol eggs trying to downplay bts un speech and hype up eco meeting Donald trump in the same go. I'm disappointed but not surprised. The fact they bringing up bts when they should focusing/worrying about they faves lol what is new pic.twitter.com/cqwEeDtSum
WELL, EXO MET TRUMP BLAHBLAH, but BTS DID A UN SPEECH BLAHBLAH, stfuuuuuuu
UN is overall a HUGE organisation and bighit should’ve been very eager to accept this offer for bts to give a speech there, what should be done now is to EDUCATE those armies supporting their UN speech instead of hating on them
Well I guess I'm a BTS fan now. (tbh I was already into them once I saw the UN speech) I wish I had even half of the unwavering confidence that they have diving into these questions.
so i guess that if i had never watched that one crack video channel i would have never known about bts and if i hadn't watched the un speech i would have never made the effort to learn their names and get to know them as people and not only as musicians [6/7]
@TooTallTae My favorite memory is when they gave their speech at the UN, it was so beautiful and important to share their message of self love which is inspiring to so many people pic.twitter.com/vhYJasxVtE
tbh it's armys who started it this time.That still doesn't give them the right to compare BTS's UN speech with that meeting, cant help it their fandom is literal trash. But the moment the news about the meet came out, my tl (only has armys) was filled with armys clowning the meet
Did you read their comments? Instead of focusing on their favs, they tried to make themselves feel better for this meeting by trying to downplay BTS UN speech. ZERO CORRELATION. They have reached another level of toxicity, so I don't even pity them.
not to mention their UN speech and attendance, youngest recipients of the cultural merit award, and constant recognition by the south korean president himself for being the nations pride and top group,,,anyways bts paved the way and is still paving it for others like bp
Ofc I'm not necessarily talking abt romance It can be any true love. Joon said in his UN speech that it took a long time to hear music calling his name. In #Heartbeat, he says: "I've been calling your name in this universe". The calls finally resonated with each other! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/magicshopbooks/status/1145347190208045059 …
Their showing the Pride parade on TV 11 EST. I'm wondering if any #Bts Armys will be holding quotes from Namjoon's iconic UN speech. I consider myself an ally so here's best wishes for any Army at the parade. Have fun! #PrideNYC

Remember : UN speech, First Lady of South Korea, president of the world bank, were in attendance with BTS. President of SK, again First Lady; attendance with BTS in France-Korea summit. Order of cultural merit only given to highly esteemed cultural korean artists given to BTS.
Bold of you to assume I now all of the that (well,except the UN speech,I saw that one)What I meant is why are you guys keep on dissing EXO every chance you can get when you can save your energy and hype BTS instead? Do you see my point?
.....so. that fandom is trying to belittle bts' un speech just bcos their fave met that racist orange blob. huh.
Yungblud just saw the Bts UN speech https://twitter.com/yungblud/status/1145023115002548224 …
Great! Actually I saw people going around throwing BTS' UN speech under the bus. But i am happy how tyere are still some mature exo-ls like you!
Why are you even bringing the UN speech in to this? it’s a campaign to STOP VIOLENCE. Do you know how many children were helped? I don’t care if you said something or not about it, because this isn’t something to talk shit about. As i said, i understand EXO had+
I'm relief that BTS didn't meet the president of the . I'm proud of them for all theirachievements.From donating money for the one's in need to the UN speech, to BTS helping us find ourselves throughout their music.. THAT'S something to be proud of. Let us continue @BTS_twt
ARMYs post saying a lot. Did I say something when your fav gives speech in UN? You act like it’s not part of your trash government, like The “ white people “there don’t make terrible decisions and still your fav stood there and spoke. Does he support them? While EXO in Korea
Tbh I can't shut up when I see others mocking Namjoon's UN speech.BTS don't teach me to hate, but to spread the love so I don't hate your fandom or your faves,I respect all your achievements and your work, so why you can do the same? You can't even compare the two things because+
BTS: promotes self love, self acceptance, talks about social issues, inspires people to chase their dreams, makes a speech at UN to promote end violence My parents: why are they wearing make-up are they gay?
you met a banana hair while bts earning millions of money and an UN speech and saving kids from starvation. okay
i love how some stans are yelling abt how bts spoke at the UN = supporting the UN = them agreeing abt the s*dan thing they literally made a speech abt how the youth should speak up and be listened to bc in that sense, they will be understood and they will understand themselves?

Same thing happened with me and my mom was saying bad things about bts like they are 'marasi' waghera. Tho i told her about their UN speech and other things but still.........
"true love first begins with loving myself" — K-pop group BTS leader Kim Namjoon UN speech
If I had not listened to/watched the UN speech. I was actually curious abt what creds they have to speak there. But that just got BTS to my door. What opened it was their Not Today MV & NO songs & vids (esp after finding out RM & Jin watched a docu on school violence).
some of yall kpop stans need to sit down if yall are gonna talk shit about BTS’ UN speech BUT flex ur faves meeting trump ...... TRUMP ???? YALL FLEXING AN ORANGE PIECE OF SHIT ???? what kinda clownery
armys would never be jealous to this event like trump really? when bts met almost all the presidents/ representatives of different countries while having a UN speech and being the first one to do so https://twitter.com/prophetmyg/status/1144929339479351296 …
just saw an OLD old mutual... who unstanned bts.... because, and i quote, "ever since the UN speech bts support and talk more and more about things i consider immoral and false" EYE-
remember this? let's talk about bts' un speech that ACTUALLY saved lives of million people pic.twitter.com/lQG7ldaOfW
chosen. so don’t come at me saying that exo hasn’t made great achievements and won’t “come close” to bts’ un speech and involvement. they are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT situations and frankly, why can’t we be proud of both groups?
No one brought his speech in this matter. It was your fandom who literally posted that video woth ath like how bts gave a nice speech at UN and how exos were losing bevasue they appearently shook hands with a mygonistic leader+++
BTS' UN speech about bullying was great and i'm proud of it and all but maybe just maybe, if ya'll actually listened to it you'd stop bullying a group for serving their duty as nation's pick. No one's proud that they're meeting trump. We're proud they got chosen to represent SK.
It's your fandom which need to learn before speak, maybe you want to check what they are saying about bts and their Unicef's campaign or their speech at UN.
@moanyyoongs My fave memory of bts is actually every memory i have of them. Since the start But i was really proud of them when they were in UN and joonie doing a speech that touched and inspired everybody
well, EXO-Ls degraded BTS’s UN speech, ARMYs are saying that EXO-Ls are happy about this meeting when they’re actually happy about the fact that EXO was invited by Moon Jae In as a representative of SouKor so siwvdksckns its messy
eggs saying that exo is the nation's pick because they met trump. but remember when bts having a speech at un about self acceptance. i'd definitely prefer and be more proud of seeing Bangtan educating racist people rather than shaking hands and having dinner with them.

don’t come at bts’ un speech when you yourself haven’t done shit for anyone. (this isn’t @a music group)

Whoever EXO'L tries to put down the UN speech BTS did well, that's fucking rude and stupid but let's not forget this whole shit started bc armys started attacking EXO for being elected to be there. Let's not fucking forget who started drama today.
What about if y'all chill, boths EXO'Ls demonizing BTS UN speech and armys saying EXO support racist shit like Trump is. Y'all are fucking stupid bro just be greatful you all stan nice boys who care about the world and shut up https://twitter.com/knjusagi/status/1145014268934414346 …
i don't dislike exo neither I dislike their fans but I find unacceptable them comparing what bts did with the UN speech and LY campaign with their faves giving a signed album to Trump and shaking his hand, like what the fuck https://twitter.com/knjusagi/status/1145014268934414346 …
did i just see oomf liked a tweet shitting on bts’ un speech. what the fuck what the FUCK
literally don’t care about exo vs bts shit. exo were just being patriotic and representing the country they love. y’all army’s bringing up the un speech is just them representing a campaign and the summit performance was bts being patriotic and representing their country pic.twitter.com/JEUJgFaEsY
Just because you haven’t seen any tweets degrading bts’ UN speech doesn’t mean it hasn’t been happening
Yes some exols have been trying to downplay BTS’ UN speech
Because they preach everything that trump stands against. Literally everything bts mentioned in their UN speech contradicts that racist homophobe.
Y'all saying shit like this for clout is so annoying tbh whICH EXO-L spoke about the UN speech????? It isn't even relevant, I haven't even seen one post where they're talking about BTS Like stop bringing random shit up to create fanwars, nobody wants this https://twitter.com/knjusagi/status/1145014268934414346 …
RT yonceuphoria: user artificiallyegg: bts making a speech at the UN is wrong when the UN has been accused of so many awful things also…
They literally said that bts speech at the un was bad etc. It’s in the screenshots. And as i said those are only a few. There are a lot more.
Oh and trump wasn’t even in the room for bts’ UN speech. Just a little fyi
the funny part is, is that we’re only proud of exo for their title in korea. we’re not supporting trump in any way. i don’t think the boys had a choice to go, either. i haven’t seen ANYONE discrediting bts’ un speech. so YOU sit down, show me receipts and i’ll believe you.
They can say the UN isn’t a good organization but that doesn’t take away from BTS’s speech. The UN is super flawed but that doesn’t take away from BTS’s message. I never saw anyone hate on their SPEECH.
Not to mention it's not even a big deal when BTS has both made a speech at the UN and performed at South Korea French Friendship concert and has the watches from the Korean president himself that are extremely hard to get an earn
I'm happy that BTS isn't me being such a douchebag As Trump he would corrupt them also not to mention the UN speech I think that's more of an in compliment than this cuz we tears met some of the world's most powerful people there

it's okay, sorry I got a little rude and swore at you. demonising BTS's UN speech is not okay, but neither is assuming the wrong things about this exo meeting the us president :/
BTS's UN speech is one thing, EXO meeting turnip and his family (idk if Melania's there, i only know of turnip himself & ivanka) is another thing. Don't compare two things that don't need comparison.
Additionally, BTS's UN speech isn't political, so inserting them into a political meeting is stupid, wtf?? That speech, that whole day was about something COMPLETELY different from politics, so why the fuck would you make it be something it's not??
honestly there's a limit. exols demonizing BTS's UN speech is too far, armys thinking that exols are bragging about meeting turnip & that they're proud of this meeting is also too far. they forgot ivanka met exo back in early 2018, so this is going to be another thing they're not
y’all got armeries dragging exo for meeting tr*mp and bragging about the UN speech, and ex*ls bragging about being the nations “first pick” and dragging bts for speaking at the UN..... christ y’all are dense
RT knjusagi: I will NOT sit here &amp; let kpop fans DEMONIZE BTS' UN speech solely for the sake of making their faves meeting an orange blob…
ANYWAYS bts have done and will have always done more than your faves. They met a disgusting man today and i feel sad that you’re proud of that. Bts’ UN speech was for UNICEF their complain against violence. Meeting that pos is not a huge accomplishment at all. Sit down.
exo-ls literally get so excited over crumbs? yall belittling bts UN speech because exo met trump LOOOOOOOL LOOOOOL YALL CLOWNS
Also one line in Namjoon speech was just... really lacking information. Smh. But most was good. Just that one live smh. Again tho, just... the UN is evil yet people here are blindly defending it cause of the surface idea of the UN and cause BTS did this. It’s why the UN used them
I didnt understand why they need to use BTS UN speech into this.. like stop humiliated urself please.. its pathetic
BTS did UN speech for humanitarian sake not for some political acts.. stop devalue it and start learning the differences.. I know yall are dumb for your oppa sake but PLEASE LEARN TO READ
Okay then so y'all shouldn't drag BTS and their UN speech. Most ARMYs especially from the US don't like Trump or support him.
I had a science computer video project last week and we were free to choose any topic so I choose the topic about self love. I put bts un speech in the video and guess what? I GOT A FULL MARKS + EXTRA MARKS!! Whuhuuu!
Let's talk about how their faves meeting the cheeto was more politically driven and how BTS's UN speech and LY campaign is a humanitarian effort.
Imagine thinking bts UN speech = meeting trump? 1) they were surrounded by world leaders not just 1 racist idiot 2) they gave a speech, talking about empowering youth to stand up, your faves? Gave an album 3) The charity? over 2mil raised, your faves? A SIGNED ALBUM
Ok . That's was really sensitive issue. Why drag them into it. And whatever we or I am gonna comment will be turned against us in one way or other. And none of them clearly know the agenda of BTS and the UN speech. This shows the level of thinking. Ignore them .
bts ain't giving speech on UN, writing lyrics about world's problem, and giving donations just for them to meet the literal cause of those problems lol
this un debate that y’all and exols are arguing about is so stupid bts weren’t even giving their speech in front of the main event it was a sub section specifically focusing on youth ... un or not it was a good, postitive focus and speech
I will NOT sit here & let kpop fans DEMONIZE BTS' UN speech solely for the sake of making their faves meeting an orange blob more impressive than it is. Just ONE of BTS' campign's accomplishments is raising over $2M & saving 340k children from starvation. Sit your CLOWN ass down.
but they are lmao, thinking they could’ve just refused is incredibly ignorant and involving bts and their un speech in this was a dumb move
bts: launches the Love Myself campaign, raises millions of dollars to help the youth, gets invited to the UN hq to give a speech at a convention for youth exols: okay but what did they do about Sudan?

people are really comparing exo meeting trump to bts’ UN speech skdjdjsj what are lungs

from what I have seen it started with trump. When one is involved with trump there is always going to be a dispute, but then that went towards attacking bts and their UN speech, and that I will defend pic.twitter.com/fbKpMEa9dx
Bringing up other groups isn’t gonna do you good in this one not to mention a portion of bts album sales are donated to unicef which is partnered with the UN hence why they were invited to give a speech plus when rv went to meet that man Knetz were upset .
they laughed at bts for having a speech at the UN we-
No one said bts has morals by going to the un lmao they show their benevolence everyday , the reason why people hype up the speech is bcs of the speech itself

A quick reminder that BTS gave a speech at the UN. Have a good day.
then don't cry when bts will still winning and your faves no."xenophobic" who? Bts literally did a speech at UN to talk about being yourself no matter who you are, but you can't relate. the one who where crying and asking us to give a chance to their faves were you kpop stans :).
didn't u give a speech at UN ???
Yeah and what I’m trying to say is they’re fighting against that adversity in the West. A lot of people I’ve seen who got into bts through the UN speech didn’t realize that they are different from the typical bg model until then. The point I’m making here is they’ve gone beyond-
oh boi how tf namjoon can ss from bts world and not get suspended lmao maybe he'll pull up that "im kim namjoon, i did a UN speech u mfs" agenda shsjsjj
Same. I thought it was someone else at first. Then again, the Namjun name was used in the UN Speech, I think.
+According to the UN General Assembly 2018 speech of Kim Namjoon popularly known as "RM", the leader of BTS, "No matter who you are, where you from, your skin color, your gender identity -just speak yourself."So don't be scared what will others say about you because they can't+
The way Jin convinced RM to do that Run Game bringing out UN SPEECH.. I bet JIN has been on twt stan all time OR watching it at least twice a day on YT.. That very moment got me tearing my eyes.. @BTS_twt
They should really... The first and only Korean artist that gave a speech in the UN... They didn't even make them wax figures... Took them a purple lighted Empire State Building in ANOTHER country for them to do in for bts in their OWN country. Tsk tsk.
Thats just sad and it makes me wanna slap that rude , barbaric embecile girl. who tf do that? i mean what about my grandma? she likes their music too, surprisingly so that she likes BTS especially RM when he did that UN speech. https://twitter.com/BritTaeBoo89/status/1144625811032551427 …
I feel like the UN speech was my favorite memory but after that every moment with bts is memorable

1st of all thank you for this @rosiehetley! My most fav memory of BTS was when BTS delivered speech at the UN. It really meant A LOT to many of us, especially me, because after that, i became an ARMY. Here's a reminder on how good the message was https://twitter.com/monosrap/status/1093164712169070593?s=19 …
Mhm when people make racist remarks.About bts and compare them to other bands and talk smack about army and the fandom. Also saying rm’s speech at UN was about hair http://products.ARMY will attack you

Since I'm not getting a response to my question let me just speak up. Its ok if you don't support ships but it's not ok to imply that anything other than heterosexuality is not normal. If you truly Stan BTS then you have to rethink your views and look back to Namjoon's UN speech+ pic.twitter.com/FcWr74OEgZ
I started by showing my mom the un speech so she’d know what they were about and then I played love myself, 21st century girls, I’m fine, and magic shop :))
Yeah, BTS promotes loving oneself, accepting oneself, helped people love others, be patient, helped people with anxiety (me included). They worked with UNICEF, gave a speech about it at the UN and they have impacted and changed aspects of the music industry.

Well actually thats how their names are properly romanized lol when they got cards for UN speech their names were written like Min Yunki Kim Namjun Jeon Jeongguk Jeong Hoseok etc
I agree. I didn’t know how much I needed @BTS_twt & Army until the day I started my adventure into their magical world after watching Kim Namjoon’s UN speech. Guess saying is true “You Never Knew What You Were Missing Till You Find It” I’m a thankful 57yo stay at home mom w/MBA
I just rewatched his UN speech, it was truly a work of art.. @BTS_twt
They said be BTS manager..it would be fun they said !!! Enjoy convincing Yoongi and tell Namjoon he'll be doing a UN speech in the future he'll be a bit convinced probably
It's not even the boy's fault. It's a game for a reason. BTS wouldn't misgender them tf is the whole UN speech for? Jim*n wouldn't want them to starve, he got through it, he will again in that game if they con. playing. If they don't like it, delete it!!!
They mentioned bts gave a speech at the un and they were like oh what about and only put the part where namjoon said they loved their fans. Which could possibly make others look at bts badly because everyone knows that the un is important and if your talking about your fans at +

one thing i wanna say is the pronouns issue,,,,DEFINITELY NOT bts’ fault...namjoon talked about it in his UN speech...and we know bts are some of the most accepting and loving people in the world the evidence is THERE... n for y’all to twist it and blame it on them is so. wrong

Fair question. I guess to me they're symbols of our obsession with performers, when the true talent, the song writers and choreographers - or in this case whoever wrote their UN speech - no one cares about. Yet BTS get all the credit?
Maybe either ask for our preferred pronouns or at least make them use gender-neutral pronouns? bts are a group of people who have spoken about the gender diversity within this fandom more than once, speaking about gender identity both in their UN speech and

My Japanese coworkers know I love bts and then one said "didn't their leader speak at the UN?" and when I told them about the campaign were all super impressed. Honestly the UN speech really was a huge change for bts and army.
+Tho RM was gaining some major momentum with his first solo activities...I agree, it took RM UN speech and him representing and speaking for BTS at global awards for some people to finally notice and respect him.
check them out, they are more then just “little boys”, BTS uses their passion in music to comfort, motivate, and inspire others. They focus on the importance of self acceptance and awareness of mental health, just check out their UN speech.

BTS while playing buffet game Jin : You need to add a motion NJ : Do we need to remember the motion ?! Jin : Yes NJ : Aren’t you overestimating us ?! Jin : RM , did you deliver the speech at the UN or not ?! NJ : I mean, I did Jin : Then Do it They way they support eachother
Are you really talking about someone who were invited to present a speech at UN and are appreciated worldwide!!!!!! @BTS_twt @Stoobbbitpic.twitter.com/TwUlB8vP5b
media be treating us like all we want is to date bts, bitch all we ever wanted was to watch their UN speech in person
Jdudfififififuududdu not at BTS bringing up the fact that Namjoon gave a speech at the UN when he started doubting whether they could play the memory game skskkssk
run bts ep today proved that kim seokjin is everyone's emotional support kpop boy like he made sure hobi was confident to play, brought up americano thing w yoongi, un speech with joon, "ctrl-v" abt the kalguksu, and jikook using "ksj" as their team name pic.twitter.com/hfkTrH5jxF
Joon: Aren’t you overestimating us? Jin: TF YOU MEAN YOU GAVE A SPEECH AT THE UN SO THAT MEANS YOU CAN DO THIS STFU Run BTS is a blessing omfg pic.twitter.com/BpaDSsG5GX
If he did the speech at the UN, he can do anything!! Go Namjoonie!!
*additional rule in a game* joon: That's too much Jin: Didn't you give speech at UN....do it then Yoongi: How on earth is it related to this? Joon: Okay! I'm convinced #runbtsep77 @BTS_twt
im just sitting here thinking about the number of times valedictorians have quoted Namjoon's UN speech in their own speech and I just feel a swell of pride and gratefulness that bts have dedicated their lives to being such positive influences to ARMYs... :')
the fact that bts are now using namjoon's un speech as their motivation too sends hhh https://twitter.com/natsooee/status/1143491189221445637 …

i'm crying, the staff made the game harder and when Namjoon started complaining Seokjin deadass went "didn’t you deliver a speech at the UN? then SHUT UP and do it" AND HE ACTUALLY DID KSJSKSJK IMAGINE BEING THIS POWERFUL OOF #BTS #Jin #Seokjinpic.twitter.com/nALwcAZdTm
bts have released several albums that have charted the billboard hot100/200, held countless sold out shows all over the world in arenas/stadiums, launched a campaign for youth to love themselves and to end violence, gave a speech at the UN, the list goes on. what do YOU do???
stereotypes (eg labelling Korean names as "gangster names" and expressing surprise that a boy band that mostly does not speak English can have a "number one [single] in the US" combined with the condescending dismissal of the BTS speech at the UN General Assembly as about "hair +
DAMN, LOL WHEN RM SAID: "AREN'T YOU OVERESTIMATING US" CUS THE RULES WERE GETTING TOO COMPLICATED. JIN BUSTED: "RM, DIDN'T YOU DELIVER A SPEECH AT THE UN OR NOT?" LOOOOOL @BTS_TWT #TeenChoice #ChoiceInternationalArtistpic.twitter.com/ITbjzXoL4e
run bts added another rule to the game they're playing and joon thought that jin was overestimating all of the members, and jin nonchalantly reminds joon that he delivered a speech in the UN before jin's savageness can hold a special meaning behind it never forget that >< pic.twitter.com/BOLBVmGd2e
bts definitely use the UN speech to make namjoon do things he doesn’t wanna lmaoooo namjoon: guys i really don’t think this is a good idea bh wont be happy bts: wOW is not the same guy who spoke at the UN??? where is that energy???? where is that man???
Joon: “ah I can’t remember this” BTS for the rest of his life: “Didn’t you give a speech at the UN tho ” https://twitter.com/kimparkdaily/status/1143496730094137344 …
I swear, when standing in front of the UN, Namjoon let his ridiculously high IQ shine bright and gave the most intellectual speech I have ever heard, and here is that same person, not managing to just grab a marker and draw something on the paper how does that even work?!
BTS: everybody say no! Joon: ...I delivered a UN speech, I-I can't. Ahh Seokjin! AHAHAHA pic.twitter.com/CXGyLMDYgp
Seokjin just used Namjoon's UN speech against him and cut off what Namjoon about to say, but he's speeches soo #TeenChoice #ChoiceInternationalArtist @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/dP04ZE3h1S
Joon: I don’t know how to do this? bts: but you gave a speech at the UN?
Joon: I can’t- BTS: ok but you gave a speech at the UN you can do this
On today's episode of BTS Run. Jin : you guys have to do the motion for this game RM : Woah, arent u overestimating us? Jin : did you or did you not deliver speech at the UN? Yoongi : LMAO WHATS THAT SUPPOSED TO HELP OR SU- RM : .....somehow I'm convinced
so the run bts staff made the game harder for them so they had to remember more stuff and when joonie complained seokjin straight up went “didn’t you deliver a speech at the un? it means you can do anything.” JOON’S FACE AHSH I CAN’T WITH THEM pic.twitter.com/C506yJUmJQ

and just to let you know burhaan, they donated the revenue they earned from their recent tour to help children in yemen. they support palestine. and have been called at the UN to give a speech. so you see, there is more to bts than just their ' gross hair ' and skinny jeans.

just those random times when I watch a video of BTS and just think how happy I am at the fact that they exist and their success and all of the positive things they have done they’re not ordinary musicians they’re unique and no one can replace any of them and the un speech just
istg BTS could accomplish so much hell they could (and should) even win a grammy and STILL i'd go back to the un speech and call it their greatest moment like,, that moment and that speech just hit differently..
in the constellation of my life" -Namjoon, UN Speech (2018)
Dear #Namjoon, @BTS_twt I love you and I just want to say thank you for your speech at the UN. I will always and forever be grateful to you for changing my life. The words you spoke that day literally opened my eyes. Thank you for showing me the way.
bts are multi-platinum artists. members of the recording academy and grammy nominated. sold out stadiums. gave a speech at the un. best selling artists ww. next generation leaders. i can't even keep track anymore, that's absolutely sickening.
This. RM rehearsing his UN speech whilst JK at the corner. I hope someone will compile (idk,maybe someone did already) all maknae's "shook" moments. pic.twitter.com/dF7oPhpHhc
as RM's speech to their at the launch of Generation Unlimited, at the UN General Assembly goes: "Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself. ",
Y'all today I went to sit for an entrance test and we had to write about our role models and I wrote about @BTS_twt and mentioned JOON'S UN speech uwu
I don't know. Maybe the one who did a speech at UN, the 1st Korean act to won Top Social Artist for 3 years a row at BBMAs, the 1st Korean act to be nominated & to won Top Duo/Group at BBMAs, the 1st Korean act to-- #ChoiceInternationalArtist BTS @BTS_twt for #TeenChoicepic.twitter.com/Tzf4VxFTD4

lmao "bts doesn't like t slur", that someone def missed out the UN speech i see :/ also f*ck them
My mum’s friend asked me why everyone likes bts so much, so i told her their story, showed her Namjoon’s UN speech and told her the real meanings behind their music. in the end she looked at me and said “now i understand why”. this is the reaction everyone should have
So I will talk about bts their Un speech how they've inspired me and helped me finding my dreams as my exam what else can I add to my exam I have to talk about it infront of my class so I have to use 10 min in order to pass
Hi @UN & @UNICEF Korean band #BTS made history by being a first band to speak at UN for @UNICEF @20toOne of @Channel9 in Australia mocked & undermined BTS UN speech. They said BTS might visit UN to promote hair products. How vulgar! @Erin_Molan @AlexWilliamson8 @bts_bighitpic.twitter.com/a96kdafNmM
Whenever I present BTS to anyone the first thing I say is, "Y'know leader RM speaks fluent English? He taught himself! He's really smart, too. He chose BTS over going solo. He gave speech at UN. He's amazing" I can't stop, you're BTS pride and ARMYs' pride #OurMagicShopNamjoon pic.twitter.com/ki94NhU9gU
There’s are quotes that I sometimes think about when I’m down. They’re from RM, the leader of BTS. These quotes are from his UN speech. I’m going to share them with you pic.twitter.com/m4RcRKzLrb
#OurMagicShopNamjoon Joonie, your achievements do not exempt you from exhaustion and slump. Reminding you of what you said in your UN speech. You are still an ordinary 24 year old guy. You can cry. You can be sad. Your ARMY are just here, offering warm hugs. @BTS_twt
There are so many @BTS_twt quotes, so many lyrics, the whole UN speech, so many other speeches etc., but from Nevermind : "If you feel like you're going to crash, just accelerate more" has become really important to me. #ChoiceInternationalArtist #TeenChoice
He is the one who made me curious about BTS. after watching his UN speech, i started to search about BTS and finally became ARMY. Thank you NAMJOON for opening magic shop door for me @BTS_twt #OurMagicShopNamjoonpic.twitter.com/iUzi73E86V

I m making my lil sis deliver the speech tat RM spoke at the UN! in the school assembly! @BTS_twt
Namjoon is Genius, you know, he gave speech at UN with his 24 years old And his speech was most deep He gave different speechs at every BTS Tour concerts, Music awards, Interview since their debut 2013!!!!! He is out of this world!!! #KimNamjoonIsGenius #OurGeniusRM
hunny stfu. so what bts spoke for the UN?? that's great and applausable, but giving a speech isn't doing a whole lot for our world hahaa. one direction have given speeches at many significant events, donated to charities, and all this shit. since when is doing something to -
Kim Namjoon, the leader of BTS, said this quote while delivering their speech in UN: “No matter your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself” Despite their hardships and challenged they encountered, they still push through to be as successful as they can be
I first heard about BTS because someone in my class used a part of Namjoon's UN speech and put it in their English assignment and I thought it was so inspirational that as soon as I got home I went on Youtube and listened to their songs (first song i listened to was save me ) +
I only just heard about this now but fucking #Chanel9apologize! BTS is the korean One Direction? Naha! No offense but 1D doesn't even compare to them! And comparing Namjoon's UN Speech to a hair-product commercial? Bitch, did you even listen to him? I don't think so!…
I purple you fam I just lost my father on 2018 Dec.. Rasa sedih dan lonely an a bit pressure i thought i start love BTS sings since 2017..they talk about love Yourself, depression also many world issues... I got my spirit again with family support. Here RM speech on UN pic.twitter.com/Yrsgig5L8T
Years old fans but many fans are over 18. And boybands are not only there for take the money. Many fans are thankfull because BTS already speaked about really important thinks like the un speech and you compare it like kim nam jun would talk about hair products.
I agree they have done many great things, like their/Namjoon's speech at the UN but that has no correlation to the genre of their music?? Kpop is a term used to refer to Korean popular music. BTS is undoubtedly the most popular Korean act. They are the epitome of Kpop
BTS UN SPEECH WAS IN RETURN OF SUPERMANJWSKMS
Nah, devastated is an overstatement. You clearly knew that they "insult" boybands, BTS not an exemption. An d insult, is clearly different from a joke. They made fun of their accomplishments like how BTS' RM did a UN speech to "talk about hair dye/ hairspray" when in fact he's +
Grammy winning lyricist composer producer dancer cultural merit award recipient recording academy member gave a speech at the UN Kim Namjoon
And regarding BTS what surprised me most they made fun of the UN speech in which they discussed such a important topic and they try so hard to make the world a better place .. we much not stop until we get a proper apology on the same show where they started it #channel9apologize
Don't you know BTS talked at UN for your information? Go listen to their speech and then call them awful if you don't like it
The UN speech.. I felt so motivated to do my best.. Actually i would say all of their achievements their desang, the mini bts events we prepare and the bts movies.. It was my country's first win relating to bts
Are u an Asian ?? If no then of course you wouldn't think it's racist. And when BTS were giving a speech at the UN for their loveyourself Campaign to end violence, @20toOne said they're talking about hair products. They can make jokes but DON'T CROSS THE LINE.
language barrier is the sole reason they dont know what BTS is trying to deliver through their lyrics... They solely hate BTS sbb diorang "kpop". Not even trying to research some information. Their speech at UN however did impressed a number of malaysians like Pak Nil.

Degrading Namjoon’s speech at the UN that was about loving and speaking yourself and talked about actual world issues by saying it was “probably about hair products” just shows that no matter how hard they work or how big BTS get people will always make them seem like a joke
This is so true.He raised bts and bts raised him,to be amazing .Mono is artwork,The UN speech was the reason I became army and it is on all accounts one of the best thing I’ve had the blessing of listening .Namjoon is a genius not cause his IQ is 148 but he knows himself pic.twitter.com/w56qFtF8H8
Dear Namjoon, today I read in front of all my classmates a text I wrote and I remembered your speech at the UN @BTS_twt
&& CANT FORGET THE SPEECH AT THE UN!
Apologize to BTS. You actually committed a crime, which defamation. You said the UN speech was about hair products, when it was about serious topics. Now @BigHitEnt can sue you! Also a lot of rich ARMY in Korea are super mad, don’t be surprised when you see a hit man at your door
Cool. No need to like. It's your choice, but think about your mom and dad before you say 'would rather die'. Here is #BTSLoveMyself that you need to check. They gave a speech in #UN as well. Hang in there, man
Hahahah lmao what was this gunhoo and bts un speech edit rofl https://youtu.be/nocsLAGmndM
Yes you are right sir, They really don't appreciate BTS.They made BTS and their speeches were a joke without them knowing about BTS and how big the meaning of the UN speech is.

Instead of saying ridiculous things with regards to their language skills and most especially a speech they have delivered at the UN for their anti-violence campaign with the UNICEF. Not only did they insulted such an important event for us and BTS but also the Korean culture+
Thank you for being considerate. I honestly exploded after i saw the video and it so sad to think they just making fun BTS, they didn't even know what good BTS has done. They inspire many of us to love ourself and be ourself. And how they mock RMs speech in UN is so disgusting.

That's good to know. I saw BTS UN speech and yes it was goood. I love Friends and I've started to listen to BTS lately and yeah even they're good.
When Kim Namjoon, leader of BTS, made a speech at UN addressing the issues young ones, future of our current generation (whether you like it or not), were facing, pleading to the coward to live themselves despite trials and to speak up in times of trouble and need-
That BTS UN speech that they mocked, those words that were spoken by RM has saved and changed many lives, I wish they knew, those words found me at some of the darkest times of life and pulled me out, Literally.
@20toOne Making racist comments about BTS, degrading their whole career for which they have worked so hard and talking talking about hair products regarding RM's UN speech is unforgivable. It was an important speech. This is intolerable. We want an apology #Channel9Apologise
I still remember hearing BTS UN speech. The moment RM said Gender Identity instead of Gender, I felt so Happy and proud. I knew then my choice of artist was not wrong. They are the kind of people whom one should make role model of.
one another. BTS spreads beautiful messages throughout each and every one of their songs. They are treating them like a joke and it’s tiring. I mean , come on , RM spoke at the UN and gave a lovely wholehearted speech. I want to talk about all of the other negative things that -
It's so outraging too see channel 9 Insulting BTS on their show ..mocking them with racist comments ....also insulting RM on his speech at UN...they may not know that millions of armys are gonna be there to support our idols. #channel9apologize #ARMY
A lot of times, I just hope Western journalists, interviewers do more research or at least watch some videos of BTS's history rather than jumping into a conclusion what BTS is. At least u should watch the "complete" speech of RM at UN b4 writing the script, which was only 7min.
Also the un speech being trashed like this sickened me heres bts talking about loving yourself and this surposed to be adults make stupid comments. All they shown my 14 year old is how nasty and spiteful adults are too

They have undermined BTS’s achievements because they do not speak the same language, committed defamation by stating their speech at the UN about a serious topic was about “hair products”, and reduced the fan base to crazy 12 year old fan girls.
I cried tears of laughter when I saw your original tweet and I'm not even a BTS fan. They have my respect and admiration though for the success they're enjoying now all due to their hard work, sweat and tears. The UN speech moved me. I followed you. Need more niceness in my life.
Aight so man's went on air and they basically made BTS into a joke, talking about how the UN speech was about hair products, showed a clip of JIMINS voice cracking, shit on the fans, like whole 9, and on top of it Alex dude went on Twitter and continued to act disgusting
The one who made the UN speech. pic.twitter.com/BXOJkkR9nz
please look at the replies on the video. he disregards things that BTS have done/ said (specifically in their UN speech) and thinks he can make a video with said assumptions and think he can generalize a huge fandom that has such diversity
I was basically recording the entire UN assembly until it was BTS’s turn but my phone didn’t save it so it’s whatever bc the speech was engrained in my mind and heart ;-;
It wasn't just the stupid "they must be gay",not even the "They are the Korean 1D" joke. THEY MADE FUN OF THE UN SPEECH.BTS donates millions to UNICEF. Messages for Self love, education, equality, acceptance? Reduced to hair products. The disrespect is real.
oh also if ur asking abt how it's unicef specifically and not just un in general, i believe it's because unicef is bts' main partner in their fight against violence, and because bts delivered that speech as their goodwill ambassadors, so it's kinda like their message too
completely trivialised BTS' achievements (such as commenting that their UN speech must have been about hair products) and purposely picked out a member's voice crack to present them in a particular way - as a talentless bunch of boys with a psychopathic fanbase. There was not
korean news talked about how channel 9 trashed BTS and said things like their UN speech was about hairspray and then played a clip of Namjoon’s speech for the love yourself campaign pic.twitter.com/fEZhVDAKZp
The fact that they equated BTS' UN speech for Unicef Generation Unlimited to "talking about hair products" is probably one of the most offensive part. I dont see the fun in making light of promoting education, skills, and training for young people all over the world.
Of course they didn’t target me but they targeted a group I really love. I get that I don’t understand how humor in Australia works however there were other ways to “joke” abt BTS than to basically target their un speech and saying that it was nothing serious
++ I saw this as an opportunity for her to be exposed to the positive aspects of bts and their achievements but instead she listened to them belittle bts and their fans with little research and shrugging off their un speech as speaking abt "hair products". ++
ofc they would be up on politics and such, but you’re missing the point. trash talking about the un speech was not ok. i think if one names themselves a comedian, they should understand what to and not to joke about.
Apologies..???? after they talk shit about jimin voice and Namjoon speech at UN and about Army's, Australian host need to be educated...Really educated, Haters always hate, what did BTS ever done to Australia host...
I wasn't able to hear most of it but basically the girl was like "I've been seeing these mf'ers everywhere" n the guy said "yea I'm not fan or anything but I've seen what these guys have done and it's kinda amazing" he mentioned LY:SY tour and the UN speech. UHHG @BTS_twt impact
And you call this an apology? It doesn't look apologetic at all. And what's more is that it doesn't look like you mean what you're saying. What ypu did was racism towards BTS and making jokes about a speech at UN? Seriously at UN were they were a big Ambassador?
They said their UN speech about self-acceptance was "probabaly about hair". And joked that BTS was only slightly worse than a N. korean *tomic b*mb being dropped on them. Talk about being ignorant and out of touch. -_- #Channel9Apologize
this article is not complete. It mentions de North Korean "joke" but it does not go over everything. This should also mention that these ppl made less of BTS UN speech by saying it was about "hair spray" and also the "gay comment this is combination of stereotypes on Asian men https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1141685652074958848 …
The bomb joke and the belittling of RMs UN speech has nothing to do with them being a boy band. Did you even watch the segment? Most of the insulting things they said were very specific to BTS and/or Korea. Your arguments don't make sense. https://twitter.com/AlexWilliamson8/status/1141505497163370496 …

ARMY are very diverse and full of professional working adults so we will call out those who undermine the hard of BTS & ARMY by belittling them in the guise of a joke? Watch #RM actual UN Speech that they made fun of pic.twitter.com/E9Fiab4X0D #BTS #KCAMexico #ARMY @BTS_twt
Yes the UN Speech was incredible. It made me respect BTS even more. I think that is what made it funny for me, because I knew the real reason, but I knew the show was just joking. I feel the joke would make more viewers check out why they actually spoke at the UN
that's not even an apology. The fact that they can't even see how what they said is completely racist and xenophobic in nature. I was extremely annoyed at how they poked jokes at BTS speech at the UN.
First of all, I, never stated that they were saying racist comments. One of the things that pissed me off though is that they made fun of BTS at the UN, saying that their speech was probably about hair products?? Let me remind you, that speech was important not only for them
#Channel9Apologise #channel9apologize That was very rude of them to diss bts like that bts has worked very hard over these 6 years and to make fun of the UN speech, they are horrible people to do that. That speech was about ending self violence. pic.twitter.com/b9lO0wsaOv
Taehyung makes me feel so my birthday yll for ya's first thing I saw that comment so Jungkook talks to Army's now I'm thirsty and I'm hungry and I'm only on episode to the UN speech which was very rude indeed a new and making fun of the South Korean boy band BTS is gonna come
I wanted to say -Your comment was only for BTS and ARMYS. -Williamson was the one who directed racism towards korean Asian community. -So you're still far more better than that Racist Australian Guy. -That racist guy made fun of BTS's social works,donations,UN speech,music etc.
"nOt oFfEnSiVe In tHe SlIgJteSt" well that's because you along with that dumbass show don't know shit about BTS...as less views as that show gets, they still reviewed BTS like shit and put false information to people,,,that UN speech?? Was definitely not about hair colours.

It's shocking to me how easily they could say all that! Even mock BTS UN Speech, ignore all the good they have done and be confidently racist and xenophobic.
Y'know what really pisses me off. The fact that yes some of his jokes were blatantly racist, they are mostly degrading. He shits on their UN speech as if he could ever be in that position. BTS have teamed up with UNICEF to make a DIFFERENCE. What is he doing? Making degrading +

@BTS_twt RM's speech at the UN was the light bulb moment I needed to finally understand how to love myself. And now my 13 year-old daughter and I fan-girl and share content with each other on a daily basis. #BTSDidThis
basically he was on a TV show in australia that: - included racist jokes towards BTS - mockingly joked about their career & achievements - made fun of RM's UN speech (they passed it off as "probably being something about hair gel"). it was... pretty damn disgusting basically
"No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin colour, your gender identity just speak yourself." -RM [UN Speech] @BTS_twt #BTSDidThis
. @BTS_twt have said many incredible things but Joon’s UN speech is one of the most touching ones. Esp the parts about his heart stopping at 9 or 10 yo, asking what makes your heart beat & that his faults & mistakes are the brightest stars in the constellation of his life.
i saw that australian program making ignorant xenophobic comments about bts w many things taken out of context (like purposefully selecting a bit where jimin’s vocal wasn’t spotless or taking one single line from the un speech as the whole message) and @jimmycarr im disappointed
Love yourself, Love myself. Peace! The way my heart burst w pride watching back bts.bighitofficial speech at UN for unicef #ENDviolence #LOVEMYSELF #SpeakYourself campaign and making this topic for my group… https://www.instagram.com/p/By8GWf2h-zx/?igshid=g8iu0l7h9fd8 …
I'm sad... There are a lot close minded people in this world. Including my husband and my parents. They always mock me for stanning BTS. I explained about BTS's song lyrics and even told them about their UN speech. But still no change music supposed to be universal
They speak at the UN speech and how to taught each other to love, speak your name, and just to be yourself . BTS also have UNICEF Love Myself campaign . This is why they help me so much with their beautiful music and lyrics. I love them so much #BTSDidThispic.twitter.com/CpFPFALNeL

Thank you for the article. The normalization of racism as humor is disturbing, and additionally, the show mischaracterizing & belittling BTS RM’s UN speech was repugnant. I don’t expect the channel or show to change their ways, but I’m encouraged that they are being taken to task
I hope he doesnt watch the clip please... Btw its gonna be hilarious if rapline make a diss track that make a reference that UN speech being dismissed as hair spray promo. I would wait for that cypher tbh. They gonna slay those racist people with their talents.

The biggest boy band we've never heard of? South Korea's 1D? Underestimating them cuz only one member speaks english? Using a clip of Jimin where he made a mistake? BTS speech in UN is about hair products? ARMYS are crazy fans? Questioning sexuality? Jesus! I sense the sarcasm!
They called bts's un speech a hair product speech. We would've ignored this bs if it was a troll. But they said that on a national television. Aren't reporters supposed to do a better job and deliver some honest information?? #ApologizeChannel9

I know that song already. The show was racist against BTS, calling us crazy fangirls, even though that's not true, we have different genders here, different ages and God knows what. Then the UN speech, that was disrespectful to say they might have talked about HAIR PRODUCTS
Yeah, i spend my money to Unicef too To support BTS Champaign but you just say BTS RM speech in UN like that, I just don't understand who are you @AlexWilliamson8
then they should've made it clear? not use it as a joke as to say they were talking about hair products in their UN speech? which by the way empowered a lot of people to speak up..like imagine being a news channel with "professional" people making unnecessary comments about BTS
Ew, just saw your show. It is straight up insulting and just wrong what you all say about BTS. You all talk about the UN speech which is not about "hairspray" it's about a real imoprtant issue, and what they said inspired so many people, not just "15 year olds".
Could you please play "The UN Speech" by Kim Namjoon of @BTS_twt
As you can see from the photo, we do not think that is racist but it is “undermining BTS’s artistry” The racism is shown when reporters said about BTS’s UN speech is about hair products. This is casual and racist bullying, mocking BTS because of their physical appearance. pic.twitter.com/8D3FTaNd1g

BTS is bringing the best of humanity together and following their lead helps us especially after such a truly inspirational speech at the UN made by RM. We should be proud in the fact that to love oneself is to love others
No mate, it not about them complaining to lyrics , it's about them calling namjoon's speech at the UN, promoting shampoos of shits, calling armys homophobic and calling bts gays, and so much more. Smh, waiting for him to get sued and come begging for apology, ARMY IS A KARMA
such as assuming that BTS don't produce their own music or their inspirational speech at the UN about self-love is probably about "hair products". Also, the individuals who have responded to the backlash generalising all fans in one nutshell is unacceptable. Like all fanbases,+

BTS didn't work so hard and reach where they are just so u could compare their UN speech to hair products. You really couldn't find anything bad about them that you had to makeup all this bullshit, right? Disgusting! #Channel9Apologise #Channel9ApologiseToBTS #FireAlexWilliamson

So it started with this Australian show broadcasting this about BTS. Bring rude and degrading their success, manipulating a clip of the UN speech and deliberately using a clip of Jimin's voice breaking pic.twitter.com/IVPSwcP9Qo
Worst part of the segment: "...mocking the group's work with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). While playing a clip of BTS discussing their philanthropic work in a speech to the UN last year, the pair remarked that they must have been speaking about 'hair products'." https://twitter.com/DailyMailAU/status/1141572150350008321 …
What made me angry were three parts specifically: the crack abt missles, the crack abt the UN speech, and the clip of Jimin's voice breaking. He's a fantastic singer, with hundreds of hours worth of video showcasing his vocals. Of course they chose the one with the voice crack.
Nothing about what was said was humorous. What was said was defamatory, racist and xenophobic. You refused to show the good BTS have done and turned their UN Speech into a ridiculous slur about hair products. This is not an apology. We demand a REAL apology #ApologiseToBTSpic.twitter.com/7c2BSxeDZC

So saying BTS spoke about hair products during their fully ENGLISH UN speech bc they’re foreign and “cant understand” is not racist or xenophobic ? So making jokes about North Korea and associating them with it is not racist ? What would you say if they said that about every
Thats what they deserve, since they specifically edited it to portray bts in a negative way, even changed the context of the UN speech which is totally unethical, this cannot be accepted as comedy https://twitter.com/DailyMailAU/status/1141572150350008321 …
Absolutely sickening how they turned BTS' UN speech as "talking abt hair products" when their campaign with UNICEF has raised over $2M and is currently directed to the biggest humanitarian crisis in Yemen. What exactly have these white ppl done that makes them think they can
BTS go to the UN and give a speech on minimizing hardship suffered by others and here you are acting like this it’s a disgrace.
finally, their UN speech is not a joke. the fact that you stripped bts' message of self love and turned it into a pun saying it was a speech about "hair products" makes you completely disrespectful not only towards BTS but towards the movement, and the intended message.
go use the hair products bts were talking about in their UN speech and while you’re at it learn a bit of grammar or something it isn’t our fault you can’t handle bts being more successful than you pic.twitter.com/5ywqsGNrKy
honestly though, i dont see that clown williamshit having to get invited to speak at the UN. bts gave a speech to spread the message of loving ourselves and their message is powerful enough to change so many lives pic.twitter.com/lU5JHfl20p
Was watching ROS in YT when @BTS_twt and RM's UN Speech suddenly appeared . Soon GunHo will be as spontaneous as Joonie! #TeenChoice #ChoiceInternationalArtistpic.twitter.com/HOdlXvqvIV
Imagine saying bts talked about hair products at their UN speech like how disrespectful might they be #Channel9Apologizepic.twitter.com/snHaR9Opyi
i understand that you have an opinion. and sure all entertainment companies like money... but bts was made differently, or at least the goal has been changed from money to making an impact. look at their UN speech, their Love Yourself Campaign against violence, etc. they’re great
what frustrated me the most was how they downplayed the importance of bts' UN speech. its main purpose was to promote self-love and confidence in young people but these assholes turned it all into a fucking joke. they downplayed a whole UN speech. so disrespectful https://twitter.com/incorrectjeon/status/1141330350850768897 …
Passable singing??? They purposely used a clip where chimmy made a mistake,,, like they're trying to demote BTS... And the fact that they said that Namjoon's speech at the UN was about hair products was beyond disrespectful... Joke or not..
Speaking of gender, I watched Joonie's UN speech again today and cried (again)... It's truly the little things that mean so much to me (and to so many others); that makes me feel seen & validates my existence & lets me know that I'm not "weird", "unnatural", etc. @BTS_twt

I wouldn't say anything mate, sure it started with that poor interview and report about BTS but also ARMY found out about his absolute god awful racist tweets and escalated from there. BTS send a message of self love, and expressed this in their UN speech, which was ridiculed.
And i oop- FIRST OF ALL they can really square up like deadass deadass they think is funny makinf fun of then like that. Oof the thing that got me most aggravated was wheb they tried to clown bts un speech. That speech is so inspirational they mad they not on they level
Not only that, but the fact they did ZERO research before stating anything about BTS is horrific. The UN speech namjoon presented was beautiful and moving and you joked about it being hair products. Xenophobia at its finest
Go ahead and keep on saying negativity. They’ll be more successful anyway. Their music speaks today’s generation. They have fans who are so diverse, from different ages and nationalities around the world. Watch and listen to their UN speech. https://twitter.com/geia_fio/status/1141536589123690498?s=21 …
I have 2 recommendations that show that BTS work is original https://youtu.be/JeODXwSenKs u can exactly see Namjoon writing his own speech to speak at the UN, I should watch Burn Up the Stage Ep on YouTube and you can see BTS writing/working on there own song without anyone’s help
They’ve help millions of people throughout the world, help advocate self love, spread positivity, talk about real world problems, have a campaign about ending youth violence, gave a 6 minute speech at UN dealing with same topics SO CORRECTION F*CK YOU pic.twitter.com/AT8mfzIUqI
Why all these grown ass men from Australia giving their unwanted opinions trying to offend “15 year olds”. Like tf you got nothing better to do with your life? Here’s a tip listen to the UN speech RM made. Look up their song lyrics in English and understand the deeper meaning
saying bts is gay was nothing, but disrespecting their appearance and speech on UN is another thing.
I'll post one more thing after that I'm done for the night, reasons why we are called BTS A.R.M.Y is simple we protect our boys and we stand up for what is wrong, after namjoon UN speech we live to show love spread it when it's needed and speak up. We don't care if you talk +
#channel9apologize #firealexwillamson The arrogance of them to say such crap about BTS....and to say that their UN speech was about hair products There’s a reason why we’re called the BTS ARMY pic.twitter.com/K5WYk2QK7p
Their UN speech speaking about factors that are effecting today’s youth was criticised, no one would address the UN general assembly about hair products. The fact that the people on that show are criticising them for such a speech isn’t just hurtful to BTS, but also dismissing-
I just came to Twitter and I see some shitty comedian talking trash abt bts by being racist and xenophobic, criticizing their music and UN speech, all in all being a complete packaged DICKHEAD. I love how we all are goin to end his career.
#channel9apologize you did think kick out members out of BTS cuz of is funny to hear? Where were the parts you mentioned as humorous hightlights? Werent we, the audiences, happy to hear those? NO, DEFINITELY NO Bringing out the UN Speech and said it abt hair product wow :)
Anyways BTS’s UN speech was all about young women speaking out and letting their voices be heard, not “hair gel” or whatever that Australian tv program said about it and trying to belittle them and us by again, portraying women’s interests as superficial.
~when he was not performing his best. Countless times the news program tried to portray bts fans as only 14/15 yr immature girls when they have many fans of all ages and sexualities. And dismissing their UN speech and joking about it being about hair products is just such ~
I’m sorry you dislike BTS and you’re entitled to your own opinion but if you would take some time to look at them, they really spread a great message i.e. their un speech, and have helped a ton of people
Did they seriously associated BTS to Kim Jong Un and to explosions just bc they are Korean, took a video of ONE voice crack to "prove" that they can't sing, only ONE sentence of Namjoon's (incredibly beautiful) speech about self love just to descretised him ?
didnt you know bts is the only boyband given the opportunity to give speech at united nations assembly? the speech inspired million of ppl not only their fan Army but also the non fan..stop hating them dude..btw bts also work with UN against violence at school if im not mistaken
This is not just an insult to BTS but to asian community as well,to make fun of their UN speech is also an insult to @UN choosing BTS.I hope one day you use your position to share positivity rather than disrespecting young group of people promoting self LOVE... @BTS_twt we you! https://twitter.com/Koreaboo/status/1141405288756649984 …
9 news absolutely degraded them. They ignored everything about their incredible UN speech, making fun of their efforts and claiming all they spoke about was their hair, including one line from a 6 minute speech. As if BTS would be invited to speak at the UN if they werent capable
do your fucking research before opening your mouth. people can use all sorts of mediums to contribute to society. just because they aren't scientists or doctors doesn't mean they don't have anything important to say. it takes one google search to look for BTS' UN speech.
Idk if this has been said but this report is very clearly made to make BTS seem superficial af-- they literally used the one part in Joon's UN speech where he stops talking about the importance of self love and working to achieve your dreams and aspirations to thank ARMY,, GOOFY pic.twitter.com/g6ybwPkDNE
BTS wrote a whole speech about self-love, speaking yourself, asked “what makes your heart beat?” at the UN only to get a comment that they talked about hair products. And they call it hilarious.
Did you watch and saw what they said about BTS in this video? Looking down on BTS's awards because "just one person can speak English" is not racist? Tell that the UN speech about love and speak yourself is a speech about hair product is ok?
It shows that they are MOCKING the UN organizer for inviting BTS to give a speech in UN just to sell "hair products". Oh wow! We don't allow this kind of discrimanation. #channel9apologize #FireAlexWilliamson @bts_twt
BTS is the reason I am who I am today. Theyve inspired me to do more and are the reason I want to do music in the future. Their UN speech changed me. They are also why I love myself
The fact that BTS were invited to the UN to make a speech which was heartfelt, touching and made an impact to the campaign... Yea it wasn't about hair products... Learn the facts before opening your mouth #Channel9Apologise
This report is extremely Offensive, there are so many unnecessarily insulting comments that really undermine BTS/ARMYS.Who are these people they interviewed? they CM about their speech at the UN,for us their campaign is important esp the people struggle so much about Themselves https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
The fact that also LIED ABOUT WHAT THE UN SPEECH WAS ABOUT The whole thing is PURE RACISM and just UGLY and you can see obviously that theyre jealous They used voice cracks ON PURPOSE They made army look BAD ON PURPOSE No wonder why many locals have a wrong image MEDIA SPREADS IT
Even if they were it wasn’t a good way to joke like that. Not only did they attack them as people, they attacked achievements that BTS worked so hard for. The UN speech is special and they had the audacity to say that namjoon was talking abt hair products like ????
Isaac, you are free to express your distaste for bts and the fans, but I’d just like to inform you that bts work to spread important messages, e.g. self love through their music (that they do indeed write) have a watch of their UN speech if you’re game pic.twitter.com/FT4pA3qmn1
#channel9apologizetoBTS 3. They intentionally used a clip of one member wherein he made a mistake in singing. 4. The hosts said that BTS's speech on UN are about hair products. They described ARMY as crazy fans and girls. +
BTS UN speech are about hair products? Oh my. So you meant all the people attending/participating the UN were......(?) Wow 20 to one hosts, wow channel 9 #channel9apologize #Channel9Apologize
(1/2)The thing that bothers me the most is the disrespectful comments towards BTS’s UN speech. They’ve poured their hearts out and have done so much for the #ENDviolence campaign. For y’all just to mock it. men using their music and platform to promote self love,
What you said about BTS was disgusting. Insulting RM's UN speech and trying to make "funny" jokes about them...That's just disrespectful.This is not going to bring anything but hate towards you so I recommend you to apologize to us army and BTS. @20toOne #channel9apologize
I don’t even stan bts anymore but that report is very much disrespectful and racist. When you think of boy bands, why the Asian version of One Direction? Both groups are different. Also how rude to say that they talked about hair products during their speech at the UN https://twitter.com/AlexWilliamson8/status/1141360240216043520 …
For example the UN speech. Whether it was a joke or not it wasn't funny. BTS did so much to get there and talk about how people should love and accept themselves. Their not promoting some hair product or anything. Looking down on on Korean boy bands aren't very nice. +
it was just rude. the complete dismissal for bts’ speech at the UN, the use of a video of jimin‘s cracking voice to try and make them seem bad, the joke about NORTH KOREA?? this is just awful and so embarrassing. you have to do something or this will keep going #Channel9Apologise
#Channel9Apologise yeah i agree. i've watch international media shit on kpop idols since the 2nd gen, get over it, kpop isn't a weird fad, bts has done some good shit like the UN speech, respect that.
First let’s begin with the UN speech, as BTS made history by being the first ever group from Korea to do so. Kim Namjoon spoke of speaking yourself and loving yourself, the power of our youth + https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
Dear @20toOne did you know how many people get inspired by namjoon's speech on UN bragging about speak to ourselves and here you are bragging about "hair product" and FYI @BTS_twt popularity is not a humor...are you asleep the whole time #channel9apologize #ARMYwithBTShttps://twitter.com/lukewaltham/status/1141391188215439361 …
Thank you for the clarification of @BTS_twt's speech at the @UN @UNICEF for @_GenUnlimited We appreciate it so much for u to actually pay attention to what RM had to say in the Assembly.. (I put the part that I want to focus at)pic.twitter.com/K3Opvtxv2V
I get that but he thinks it’s funny, it’s not only about how it was bts I’m mainly mad because it was so rac!st also un speech about hair products bts was telling us were not perfect but love yourself & saying Jimin c*nt sing that’s his living have respect but tell me he can’t pic.twitter.com/JE5zGinhD7
i am so angry right now, to undermine their un speech to 'hair products' when bts has raised more for charity then any of those 'comedians/celebrities'. the xenophobia and homophobia they allowed to air on national television is revolting.
(Tweet 3/4) @AlexWilliamson8 @Channel9 4. Jimin's voice cracked in the clip shown because THEY HAD JUST GOTTEN DONE WITH A WORLD TOUR! 5. All 7 members of @BTS_twt are important and none of them deserve to be fired! 6. BTS's UN speech was about SELF LOVE.
G'day, Mate! Listen carefully speech of RM from BTS at UN! (You may not deny the United Nation, right?) We, ARMY, pretty sure that you deserve responsibility for what you mumbled. What a pity you don't know BTS. Shame on YOU! #channel9apologize #channel9apologizetoBTShttps://twitter.com/fly_bts_0613/status/1141504324880617474 …
They said it and know it themselves that BTS fans are hardcore. So why try to publish this episode? "Their singing is great." Then you insert a clip of the time Jimin cracked his voice? And a UN speech about hair products? Do u even know what UN is? https://twitter.com/btsfreakkk/status/1141413326020198400?s=19 …
This is really disgusting.. If I'm not misheard they said that bts give speech at UN abt their product?!are you crazy?!gosh I'm rlly angry!

Also @20toOne what the actual fuck how dare you make that comment about BTS at the UN I don’t see you there saying a speech. Do you know how hard they have worked to get were they are now. Have you had tickets sell out in under 25 minutes and won many awards. #channel9apologize
@channel9 @20to0ne can’t be funny w/o tearing ppl down. You denigrate BTS for being Korean & not fluent in English & seek out a voice crack clip. They're the Hyundai global brand ambassadors, who own @kiaaustralia who sponsor you. The UN speech related to mental health & suicide pic.twitter.com/lYnkLRHyzz
#channel9apologize BTS deserve an apology, and so do we. @20toOne your behaviour toward BTS was disrespectful and rude. You are attacking BTS with disgusting comments about their music, talent and UN speech. This is not acceptable and racism is never funny. We want an apology.
" The biggest boyband you have never heard of" " have you guys been living under a freaking rock ? And to mock their UN Speech by saying it talks about HAIR PRODUCTS ? please educate yourself before you talk about BTS
but joke’s really on them, they’re promoting bts with their mvs, un speech and interviews displayed. and who really listens to the eww ppl anyways, they’re just spewing out trash and fear, most of the population in australia aren’t that twisted so
That video is seriously disgusting like wtf listen I get it you don't like bts music I'm not getting pissed about that there is music I don't like and nobody can tell me nun but wtf the racism is clearly evident disregarding bts speech at the UN like they didn't have something +
@20toOne The fact that you guys barely did any research about BTS, ESPECIALLY about their speech at the UN absolutely DISGUSTS me! They didn’t even mention ANYTHING about hair products at the UN. How DARE you disrespect them like that! Please apologise to them. Thank you. https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141308512913383424 …
The fact that you guys deadass made a joke about the UN speech was distasteful asf. The speech that Joon gave was powerful and inspiring and you literally commented about hair products. That was a historic moment and y'all literally shitted on it. Fuck you @20toOne ...ILY BTS https://twitter.com/incorrectjeon/status/1141330350850768897 …
I'm shocked and embarrassed of the racial comments and ridicule. BTS are more than what they talked about, eg UN speech. I can't believe how uneducated and rude these comments were, especially when bts constantly promotes love and gratitude. Shocking!
You disrespected BTS so much. Scorning a SPEECH they made at the UN and mocking them is an all time low for you. They and ARMY deserve. an. apology.
Out of curiosity have you seen bts' UN speech? Do you even understand why people are mad? Or are you just marking the fans down as over protective groupies despite not doing any research
is just so upsetting. on top of that, bts’ speech at the UN was completely stripped of its meaning and was the centre of a “joke” which is absolutely sickening. australian armys DO NOT claim such behaviour. i won’t let the racism slide and neither should you.
Here for you all uneducated people in @Channel9 who did the #20toOne who never did their research before posting on tv. Here is the full speech in the UN of #BTS. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg #channel9apologizetoBTS #FireAlexWilliamson
BTS did not talk about hair products in their UN speech. They're not gay for taking care of their appearance. So what if it happens that they are gay? Is being gay wrong? We don't have time for your homophobic and xenophobic crap @20toOne. #FireAlexWilliamson #channel9apologizepic.twitter.com/b6DTc3p0vA
I feel you this video get me so mad to see these people be so disrespectful and rude to bts i got really mad when they said that their UN speech would talk about hair products and shows Jimin having his voice crack
Here are the people who don't do research before posting on tv. #BTS has helped so many people around the world. They UN speech is about Loving yourself not about hair products. #channel9apologize because your not just hurting #BTS but #BTSARMY #20toOne https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …pic.twitter.com/h7wvj8PfIQ
THE AUDACITY TO PUT JIMIN'S UNSUCCESSFUL HIGH NOTE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THEIR VOCAL CAPABILITY AND PUTTING "WE HAVE THE BEST FANS IN THE WORLD" AS A SUMMARIZING SENTENCE FOR THE WHOLE UN SPEECH I AM FURIOUS AND THIS IS SUCH A SICK JOKE i hope bts never sees this
The audicity they had to say that BTS' UN speech was "probably about hairproducts". If this is what you call funny then I don't have humor. I recommend you to go listen to that speech and love yourself a little more because it doesn't seem like you do.
I’m 57yo & found BTS after watching their UN speech on CNN. It’s been a wonderful journey into the vast cosmos that is the @BTS_twt galaxy. This incredible grp of multitalented artists write, compose & produce their own music w meaningful lyrics 2 help others heal #ArmywithBTS
pic.twitter.com/SY71zjYj0l This is the most disgusting video ever. They where making rude comments about them, and how Namjoons speech was about hair product...WHY THE UN LET BTS ON THE DAMN STAGE TO TALK ABOUT HAIR PRODUCT?!??! @20toOne APOLOGIZE TO BTS!!! DISGRACEFUL PEOPLE!!!!!
Okay so uhh this is offensive in lots of ways, demeaning, and making a joke of everything BTS has done. Picking the One voice crack to make them look bad and imply they can’t sing? Joking about the UN speech? The fucking “something exploding from Korea” joke?? Fuck this shit https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …

Bts,along with other kpop groups,are extremely hardworking and practice endlessly to perfect themselves. Namjoon’s UN speech was extremely meaningful and he talked about his own struggles he faced with himself. It’s just so senseless that you equated it to hair products.
the funny thing is, to get the UN bit they used, they had to have watched the whole speech. poor taste on their part to completely disregard their message that bts wants to portray.
No other act in History besides BTS and the Beatles has accomplished that feat. They were the first Korean group to be invited to the UN where they gave a GREAT speech about Loving yourself and all you could comment on was HAIR PRODUCTS? +
you guys actually think it’s funny that you said those things about Bts but in reality you just mad you’re not them . Bts UN speech is one of the most inspirational speeches I’ve ever heard in my life apologize to the legends. pic.twitter.com/cAKBefU3g5
7 Korean men who are Global Ambassadors for UNICEF, delivered a speech at the UN on mental health, advocates SELF LOVE. Yeah best believe I'm a 19 year old fan. But it wouldn't matter if I were 10 30 or 50 because BTS's message transcends age, language, race, gender. #ARMYwithBTS
WAIT HAWD DAWN QYNA REALLY MENTIONED NAMJOON N BTS N USING HIS UN SPEECH AS PART OF HER GRADUARION SPEECH SKSKSKSKSKSKSKSK @softaeger
to use bts for clout. And an imbecile was saying never heard of them, even calling their UN speech hair ads. From all this i realized that some pple choose to be dumb even though the might be given opportunities not to. In other words #Channel9Apologize #FireAlexWilliamson
2) They mocked the U.N. speech. these people love to constantly throw the UN speech around without listening to the message or looking into the literal MILLIONS of dollars BTS has raised for UNICEF. the money BTS constantly donate without announcing.
#Channel9Apologise when the lady said 7 is alot you can fire 4 of them ( who the f**k is she to tell that) and being rude about BTS's UN speech and lastly calling them gay and discriminating BTS They need to apologise to @BTS_twt #FireAlexWilliamsonpic.twitter.com/PgmPWFQhkW
I am beyond disgusted by all the racist, disrespectful and rude comments made.

Don't focus on the fact that we sold out stuff. Focus on the fact that BTS gave a speech at the UN. Focus on the fact that part of the profit goes to charities.

It just fucking disgusted me. The way they said the UN speech was about hair products. It was about how we as people need to love ourself. BTS has saved many lives. I am angry that they did not use any professionalism.
... to see how they used clips such as the one of BTS at the UN and edited them in a way to contribute to all the bullshit they were speaking when in fact that was a very important and significant speech. So disrespectful and fucking disgusting. I’m sick.
i’m sick of news channels degrading bts for their ethnicity. why does ethnicity matter in the entertainment industry? they really degraded bts for their UN speech? they really degraded them for having one member speaking fluent english.

The fact that they sampled the UN speech as if BTS were only saying they love us to get us to stay their fans, like..?! These people are making us look like brainless, hormonally-imbalanced fools and that pisses me off so freaking much. I hope they make better research next time.

I don't think an apology would be enough after slandering BTS & Army. They should at least report in detail about the UN speech & the Campaign, how much BTS helped & donated+ about army projects etc. to show gp the truth about BTS. #Channel9Apologize @Channel9 @BTS_twt #ARMY
Man I’m sorry but you don’t even support any charities do you? have you even been to the UN? Oh sorry to embarrass you, BTS gave a speech at the UN, and received a national award from the Korean president.Please clean your mouth before speaking, don’t spit sh*t all over the place
So I’m pretty sure everyone has heard about the drama with Alex. I am EXTREMELY upset about that. Another thing that got me really upset is the Australian interview. Not only did they criticize BTS they said that at the UN speech they talked about hair products!!
Seeing this incredibly moving speech glossed over in a report, I feel compelled to share it again. #SpeakYourself #LoveMyself #LoveYourself #BTSUNspeech https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
I cant believe you found this UN speech and presented it as speech about "hair products"... even if BTS has younger fans, 10 12 14 16 yo they seem to be more educated, open minded and respectful #Channel9Apologizehttps://twitter.com/fairievante/status/1141362414073630721 …
This happens to every act? Where show me and the Perez bytch is a whole bts anti who doesn't leave a chance to put down bts and thn there's Alex who is whol pedo, racist they knew what they were doing to bts while mocking them n cut down UN speech to add crazy fan girl narratives
He trashed bts, said their UN speech was about hair products...etc on a news report...he apparently also trashed other artists (1d, Beyoncé...) and now all fandoms assembled to end his career I mean look at this..https://twitter.com/alexwilliamson8/status/1141367682102525952?s=21 …
relevant. But talking trash about BTS was very much an old trend. You cannot just take a video of one of the members strained vocals and use ONLY that as a way to denounce their abilities. You cannot just belittle their UN speech. Please, we’re all tired. #Channel9Apologise

Sorry couldn't hear you over bts speech at the UN, 5billion views across their songs on YouTube, 20m followers, Grammy nomination, and people comparing their popularity to the beetles. have fun with that "comedian career" of yours. Xx
They were not just being racist, xenophobic, they mocked bts, they called them gay on national television, they cut the whole UN speech, intentionally showed a clip when a members voice cracked ...this is nothing but the pure ignorance towards bts cz they're asain n it shows!!!
btw bts was also awarded medals of cultural merit by the president of South Korea himself, the members were also invited to give a speech at UN amidst countless leaders due to their contributions in raising money for their UNICEF campaign
I think they are not educated enough and we should educate them especially their own native language so they can actually understand what the BTS UN speech was about. Also I remember BTS being compared to the legends Beatles (which is an honor if honestly speaking) + https://twitter.com/incorrectjeon/status/1141330350850768897 …
Disgusting—to sum it up. A guy rly said (paraphrasing) once he heard something from Korea had taken over America he was “worried” WTF. He reduced BTS’ UN speech to being about “hair products.” P*rez H*lton said he got flack for assuming they’re gay because “it’s simple math” lol
bts IS ONLY BTS and disregarding their entire un speech about loving oneself just to "haircare products" bc "hurr durr kpop people makeup pretty people" is completely disrespectful #channel9apologize
Being racist,Making fun of our boys,Mocking the UN speech,Using a clip of Jimin when he was ill...Absolutely disgusting!!They should lose their jobs for this behaviour!!It's not big and it's not clever!! It doesn't make you look good,You look pathetic !! #BTS #channel9apologizepic.twitter.com/l3nLxcXEjz
Is this supposed to be funny?? Like I can’t find the joke here. This is so fckin disrespectful! They completely diminished everything BTS stands for. Hair products?Really? Did you even pay attention to RM’s UN speech?? Like how fucking dare you...
you don’t have to like bts but don’t insult them based on lies. bts have done so much and helped so many people. insulting their un speech was probably one of the WORST things they could have said and now they get to see just how powerful bts and army can be
I can't believe that they thought this was an okay thing to do? They were racist towards them, made jokes about them, showed a video of Jimins voice cracking and they made fun of Nam's UN speech. They were so unnecessarily mean and horrible to the boys. #BTS #channel9apologizepic.twitter.com/YYIHvljuzC
this is fucking sickening. they’re adults that show NO respect for other adults, just because they think the world revolves around english; thus thinking non-english speaking people are stupid. also, to minimize bts’ incredible and important un speech is just plain disrespectful. https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
I'm livid over that news segment on BTS. That should have never been aired. Making fun of Namjoon's speech at the UN, saying "it was probably about hair products". Yeah, a big fuck you 20 to One
Yeah sure at least we were educated enough to know how to address girls normally and not just call them cunts. And dude I don't know who the fuck you think you are but BTS's UN speech would be a great kickstarter for your education. We were nice this time. Dont let this get nasty
@20toOne excuse me?you wanna tell me that you've got time to find a video of Park Jimin wherein he makes a little mistake in singing but you don't have time enough to watch the whole speech from BTS on UN which is against violence at this planet?! shame on you #Channel9Apologize
Am I surprised @20toOne used BTS as its punchline? No. But to see white entertainers have a go at a popular minority group for having only 1 English speaker was at best ugly. Equating their UN speech to a hair product is pathetic. Show could've gotten digs in w/o being idiotic.
yes, exactly!! they ignored the impactful and positive parts of bts (like reducing namjoons UN speech to a speech about hairspray??) and attacked them without even thinking they were doing something wrong. disgusting.
when you knock BTS’s UN speech because you’re a racist asshole you can bet you’re going to get destroyed #FireAlexWilliamsonpic.twitter.com/0uz4dR27Gq
To not only make racist comments degrading bts but to specifically mentioned Namjoons speech at the UN and equate it to speaking about hair products when he has such an important topic to discuss #Channel9Apologisepic.twitter.com/XoEFYHhrkZ
so this one mofo had the audacity to refer NamJoon's UN speech as hair commercial. Do they not think before they speak or is this them just being themselves i.e. being dumb
They called BTS as "korea's one direction" , and saying BTS "singing is...possible?" Even said that RM's speech at the UN is "probably was about hair products." Abd "ask if BTS are GAY" They call us ARMY's as "young crazy fangirls" .
So when exactly is @20toOne planning to apologise to @BTS_twt for its disgusting commentary and outright racist mockery? And...they seriously said that such an important UN speech was about hair products?! Well, no one would ever invite their sorry selves to the UN.
I was inactive for a but and this is what happens,clout chasers this days,really put jimin's cracking voice and made up the wrong meaning about RM's UN speech,a white shit was also hating on bts,ya'll get ready cause your order for a lawsuit is coming soon #channel9apologize
They think it’s funny but it’s not only about how it was bts I’m mainly mad because it was so rac!st and there just making jokes also because they said Jimin c*nt sing like where the un speech about hair products like bts was telling us to love ourselves and speak ourselves pic.twitter.com/RaJHxGBX8X
Bts is suchha a topnotch group that @20toOne literally had to search for those 0.0001% videos where their voices cracked while singing and clowned 'THE' UN speech of bts. Desperate disrespectful attention seekers, you clowned yourselves not bts!!! #channel9apologize
I usually avoid these things, but how dare you dig for videos of Jimin's voice cracking, make a joke out of namjoons un speech, and disrespect bts for only having one English-speaking member? I'm DISGUSTED, but sadly not surprised... #channel9apologize
blatant xenophobia, insensitive comments on sensitive sociopolitical issues of the past and now, dismissing bts’s accomplishments by making jabs at their talent, language, and style, and even invalidating their powerful speech at the un? are you KIDDING— #channel9apologizepic.twitter.com/L9Ew7zehsO
Remember when @BigHitEnt was suing over defragmentation of #BTS reputation and image. Yeah these Australia TV personal and TV agency is going to get their ASSES HANDED TO THEM NOW!! Also, the UN wants nothing to do with you either because their UN speech was beautiful! https://twitter.com/Koreaboo/status/1141405288756649984 …
This is so horrible all these people need to be fucking fired. Not only did they disrespect us and bts but they talk about issues they know nothing about. Not one of them has listened to a full song or even the UN speech which are all about loving yourself and become the https://twitter.com/incorrectjeon/status/1141330350850768897 …
imagine having the audacity to insult bts’ UN speech
Imagine being that disgusting. They were so racist, the way they made fun of the boys and joked about their language and singing was absolutely disgusting and then they made fun on Nam's UN speech. I don't care if this was a joke, it was disgusting... #BTS #Channel9Apologizehttps://twitter.com/kimjaesthetics/status/1141333081669828608 …
Whatever the intention of this show is, it clearly depicts cultural diffrences. But it is very very wrong to edit/cut out videos and put it there in a clip . their UN speech is not just all about the Army... the solo singing of Jimin... praying for understanding
Aaaaa the racist mf from that Australiane show that was so disappointing and disgusting not how they called rm speech in un about hair products thats so ugly, BTS and army need a apology from every single person who disrespected bts in the show
" And they even spoke at the UN. What about ? I'm gonna say Hair Products ". I can't believe they just said BTS gave a speech on hair products where as they gave a speech on SPEAKING OURSELVES & LOVING OURSELVES and constantly saying to love yourself. EYE- #Channel9Apologizepic.twitter.com/UJndib5jbS
BTS are literally in college while doing a world tour and producing music on a regular basis. Do you really think uneducated men would be giving a UN speech in front of world leaders?
This pure racism. This media company blatantly disrespected BTS and ARMYs. They deliberately downplayed BTS’ UN speech and UNICEF campaign. Shame on these hosts and the people involved. It’s pathetic. pic.twitter.com/GFdkeKziEb
Namjoon UN speech is not about hair products @20toOne. One of your sponsors is Kia and Kia is under Hyundai and guess whose their global ambassadors.... yup it’s BTS. APOLOGIZE. #Channel9Apologizepic.twitter.com/D5zQ3rePau
The fact that they're joking about the UN speech of BTS, J€RK I bet you didnt even had the chance to be there and give a speech.. APOLOGIZE BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. YOUR CAREER IS GOING DOWN FASTER #channel9apologize
listen up, not only did this chanel, disrespect bts and armys, but they made fun about the un speech saying its probably about “hair products” , calling out jimin for his vocals, their singing is “passable” and that chanel +pic.twitter.com/wfMTZRWROh
#Channel9Apologize for 1. Joking about bombs exploding in a country 2. Saying BTS' speech at the UN is about "hair products". You did not only disrespect BTS but also the United Nations 3. Making fun of the group coz only one of them is fluent in English @20toOne @Channel9
@People claiming it’s true, where’s your 19 wins on a track? Your UN speech? Your billboard top group award? You invitation to be apart of the Recording Academy? No where in sight. just admit you have a secret bts stan account and go
nam joon was literally SHAKING during his UN speech about LOVING YOURSELF and to make it seem like he was talking about something completely different is so disrespectful to bts and the UN.
What in the actual fuck is this?? One don’t use BTS for your own personal gain especially if you have no intentions to actually put in the work to know them and their story. TWO do your fuckingn research, did you watch the UN speech? No you didn’t https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
This is SO disrespectful.. mocking BTS without checking receipts, purposely picking clips of the boy’s voice cracks, mocking their UN speech (Which HAD a meaning and was %100 in ENGLISH) claiming ONE member can speak English (which isn’t true obviously) and mocking fans- really? pic.twitter.com/niPEeXxdbn
#channel9apologize Absolutely disgusted by the constant xenophobia and racism that your 20 to One show has been showing.The fact that you edited BTS UN speech clip in order to enforce xenophobic narrative instead of focusing on the actual message shows how disgusting you are
Okay man but who in the world will go to the un to give a speech on hair products . Perhaps educate yourself? Also, bts doesn't need an 8th member. They're happy with 7 good bye
#channel9apologize BTS deserve an apology, and so do we. @20toOne your behaviour toward BTS was disrespectful and rude. You are attacking BTS with disgusting comments about their music, talent and UN speech. This is not acceptable and racism is never funny. We want an apology.
please help to complain about this. if you didn't watch the video, they talk about bts really patronisingly, use the worst clips of them possible, and say that their UN speech was about hair products, when it was about their unicef project with the love yourself series + racism.
somebody tell president moon that bts aka his favorite sons aka korean's pride getting slander and they even mocked bts' UN speech>:(
I can’t believe they insulted them like this. I’m disgusted. Namjoon worked so hard on that speech for the UN, he was even shaking, and they fucking insulted and made fun of his speech which he worked hard on. BTS all work hard and deserve all the love and support they get https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
I will not let only ARMYs and BigHit to do something about this. They should never disrespect BTS especially the UN speech of Namjoon.
They used BTS’ their speech at the UN in their video What is Gun Hoo Saying~? [The Return of Superman Ep 282] https://youtu.be/nocsLAGmndM
@20toOne have publicly spread false information to their viewers about BTS' UN speech and videos which harm the group's image. This is an act of defamation and fake news. @Channel9 #Channel9Apologize #Channel9Apologize #Channel9Apologize
The fact that BTS literally promotes self love and their speech at the UN was about ending violence against children and teens and they made it a joke about hair products
I can usually let shit slide honestly. But this? Between the Jimin singing clip and them saying the UN speech was about hair care products...oh I’m fucking livid.
They're spreading false information they're say UN speech is hair products, they're say BTS is gay, that's so rude, please #channel9apologizehttps://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
Its really not funny. These racist channel9 and its racist people hiding behind a ‘joke’ show? It is who they are, they think racism, xenophobia and sexism is alright. They even mocked @UNICEF UN speech too! @unicefkorea #Channel9Apologize #channel9racist
I can tell you guys tried to be funny. I see it, okay? But the problem is the way it was delivered, and the fact that Aussie Armys are trying so hard to make BTS notice them while you defame BTS and say their speech at the UN was about "hair products" isn't comedy, it's ignorance
People on this radio channel were being very racist and disrespectful to not only bts but army as well and even called them gay they kept comparing them to North Korea... They also were saying that their speech at the un was about hair products...they are extremely rude
bro im literally 18, and im going off to study politics and international relations cause of bts' speech at the un?? its not about money its about their message. you be dumb dumb like red velvets single
1st of all you racist bitch, BTS make songs that help people who don’t love themselves. If you paid attention to their UN speech then you would’ve realized that they were born to change the world n erase unnecessary waste of space like you. @AlexWilliamson8
Maybe this person doesn't even know that more than singing and dancing, BTS were appointed as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors and gave a historic speech at the UN General Assembly. So much ignorance & hate Btw, thanks for making me 18 years younger!
And they just assume people haven’t heard of BTS even though they are literally the biggest group in the world! They even made fun of Namjoon’s speech at the UN and said he probably talked about hair products when in reality he actually talked about real world issues
bts out there holding a speech at the UN, being uncief ambassadors and you’re on twitter arguing with their fans over racist things you said on a channel i never heard of before lmao pic.twitter.com/7XxryWpCQL
the report @20toOne did on bts is just so fucking disrespectful in so many ways - the clip of Jimin they showed singing when his voice cracked - and the comment about their UN speech - no, it wasn't fucking about hair products you xenophobic cunts jfc get a life
imagine taking bts' UN anti-bullying speech that focuses on loving yourself and using that to mock them like that... absolute yikes
The fact there's people who think we are all 14 y/o when I am a 30 y/o psychologist who has worked in HR for 5 years and these boys gave a speech in the UN and are ambassadors for UNICEF... I am just sad how closed minded some people are @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/ymwPvfGAVC
can't hear your from bts speech at the UN and their unicef campaign, nor their amount of donations to different campaigns ugh, their power. https://twitter.com/AlexWilliamson8/status/1141367682102525952 …
wow this was truly disgusting the way they completely undermined the beautiful UN speech : ) also love how they spew bs abt bts being the "biggest band you've never heard of" but still found and used that clip of jimin from a korean awards show like honey your racism is showing
your segment about bts was so disgusting to watch, I actually felt sick. the extent to which you belittle all of their massive accomplishments (for example the UN speech) speaks in volume about how ignorant you are.
Would love to see any of the clowns at this station learn another language and deliver a speech in front of the UN, get up on stage and do 1/4 of what BTS does. The amount of disrespect in one segment is astonishing. These people messed with the wrong fan base.
This was downright disrespectful. They kept shoving up BTS’s mistakes such as Jimin’s voice crack, which is not in any way ok. Namjoons UN speech about loving yourself, which is a very important topic, was being FALSELY DESCRIBED as “Hair Products” https://twitter.com/vantestaegi/status/1141323331150462976 …
the amount of times i have watched and will continue to watch BTS’ UN speech pic.twitter.com/qa1Hb6h2qB
have you actually done your research mate? BTS had a whole damn UNICEF project to fight violence and raised over 1M dollars towards it and continue to raise for it, they gave a speech at the UN and they've achieved more things in 6 years than you have in your life, deadshit x
bts deserve an apology, and so do we. you attacked the boys with disgusting comments about their UN speech, their vocals, their music, their intelligence. and then you attacked army's. it's unacceptable and honestly just pathetic. so an apology is needed. #Channel9Apologize
they had the chance to cover the great accomplishments made by bts & even discuss the importance of a foreign group presenting a speech at UN. but no, we gotta get these damn views & the only way to get them is to make racist comments and to reinforce the idea of insane fangirls
BTS getting hate and degraded by white journalists have become something very common now but degrading Namjoon's UN speech? the speech that holds deep meanings, it's a ray of hope for many. They paid it dust like nothing. I hope they get payed badly for it I am so mad rn
so tired of people trying to turn bts success & achievements into topics of crazy fans instead their UN speech, breaking records, sold out tours & music promoting self love. As Halsey said when a young woman likes something its seen as stupid but really it’s just being passionate pic.twitter.com/1VbflCDZfJ
@20toOne get out of here. bts and army need an apology. what was said was extremely rude, prejudiced, and racist. the guys deserve so much more. to start, you purposefully turned a really meaningful UN speech into one that advertises hair products? + pic.twitter.com/zA6l1904XT
I think some people need to be reminded what RM’s UN speech was about #BTS #UN pic.twitter.com/SW8BYHRcLn
they edited their UN speech to make it seem like it wasn’t an incredibly inspirational speech addressing serious issues so that they can continue to say that bts are just a cringey kpop boyband and their fans only like them for their looks and have no taste in music
i really don’t get it. there was NO reason to come after them like this and downplay their many successes. the UN speech was one of the most touching moments fans have been able to share with BTS and they just made fun of it... pic.twitter.com/z6Aev5IFK6
what annoyed me most of all about that “interview” was that they used a clip from bts’ UN SPEECH!!!!!!!! and said they were probably “talking about hair products” like how mf dumb do u have to be
but do you know that bts have a whole campaign with unicef they had a speech at un also they are literally trying to make everyone feel loved and worthy their whole discography is about finding yourself speaking yourself loving yourself like pls check the info before you judge
@20toOne your blatant racism and disgusting comments about @BTS_twt show how out of touch you are with what the rest of world is doing. To even suggest that #RM gave a speech at @UN about hair products is disgusting! This group of men has touched the world through https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1141342122341257217 …
I saw that fucking vid and I swear it's so disgusting disrespectful uuugghhhhhh! And they're joking about our boys UN SPEECH about hair products?damn these ppl. How come they've been hired at the first place. @bts_bighit should take action for this.
@20toOne I'm so UPSET about how your channel treat asian boygroup BTS. It's just rascism. The most thing I upset is the way you edited UN speech. It was seriously warm, meaningful contents for all generation as well as new generation. How could you edit it like about CRAZY FAN?
This is so disgusting. Not only did they totally misinterpreted us armys as crazy teenagers and homophobes but also disrespected bts by completely leaving out their important UN speech and putting a clip of Jimin’s voice cracking as if they 'can’t sing'. Disgusting really https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
@20toOne So you guys decided to mock BTS and dismiss their message of spreading positivity and loving yourself. Then you have the audacity to make fun of their speech at the UN. Your xenophobic personality is showing. https://twitter.com/vantestaegi/status/1141323331150462976 …
What have you done? BTS actually do “good” for the world (since providing happiness for people isn’t enough for you) with their own partnership and campaign with UNICEF that raised 1.4 Million USD. Let me know when you give a speech at the UN https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
@20toOne ,, it seems you need educating let me help you. BTS’ UN speech was very important to so many people, and for you to talk down on it and dismiss it was blatantly rude and damaging. So let me show you your mistake. Their UN speech spoke about a lot of current world issues+ pic.twitter.com/smF8qD5CJt
*Important* ARMYs kindly read this thread! A news channel in Australia defamed BTS and distorted the UN speech into something else, called them Gays on national TV.

I am so ashamed of them. In particular saying the UN speech which was on behalf of a charity to end self violence was about hair products just bc they are korean pop singers... oh channel 9
This TV segment needs reporting for being Racist! Insulting Ot7 n call them korea's one direction, their singing is possible? RM's speech at the UN probably was about hair products ask if ot7 are GAY? even displayed ARMY's as young crazy fangirls. #ARMY #BTS_twt to #20toOne https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1141342122341257217 …

What is this show and where was this even aired? They've gotten almost ALL information about BTS wrong, especially the UN speech. As much as I'd love to claim that Namjoon talked about us in there, it was NOT exactly ONLY about the fandom. He also talked about himself, and https://twitter.com/vandaegukk/status/1141327945329340416 …
My favorite part is when they talk about the UN speech. BTS is actually trying to make a difference in this world and help people. They are really helping people. People like yourself represent what needs to change. I hope your eyes are opened.
I'm not even gonna say "please" to people like you. Just apologize to BTS already!You can't defame someone like that. I don't even get bothered by people like you who always try to defame n downgrade BTS, but what you said about Namjoon's UN speech was absolutely wrong! Apologise
It's not mk bish it's UN speech
You act like our anger w you and the others is unjustified, there’s blatant xenophobia and racism towards bts alongside the erasure of their UN speech calling it “probs about hair” not to mention the constant defamation of both bts and us, the fans. https://twitter.com/tim_blackwell/status/1141335878381387777 …
it’s really that bad & i really hope you see why. being of yellow skin myself, no matter how successful we become, we’re still the easiest target of a joke. australia is the first country in the world to broadcast their “humour” about bts’ speech at the UN, which is appalling.
Done, had to use handy dandy google to find synonyms for advanced words. Even said they need give a broadcasted apology that told the public of their wrongdoings and another BTS Segment that displayed their accomplishments, UNICEF, actual meaning of UN speech and diverse Army
yeah ofc- basically they were incredibly disrespectful and xenophobic towards bts. they mocked their singing abilities qnd showed the clip of jimins voice breaking at an award show, they called them the korean 1d, mockes their un speech by saying they probably only spoke about-
You said that BTS's UN speech was about hair products. I bet UNICEF wouldn't be happy to hear about that
They defame BTS and also purposefully spread wrong information about Namjoon’s speech at the UN
bitch I'm gonna find EACH one of you jobless piece of shits that dare to disrespect bts and even make a joke about their UN speech which is absolutely NOT FUNNY
Wow they downgraded issues like prevention against violence towards children to young adults which @bts_twt, @UNICEF & ARMYs are working hard to make awareness, educate, speak up & ask for help & to prevent. The purpose of Namjoon's UN speech.
Yall even dared to say smth about the un speech Bts is doing smth yall clearly cant do they are actually helping ppl by spreading their message While yall cant even make a relevant news that could have helped so many ppl right now
there are so many great things about bts and they chose this type of content while diving into them? how can you listen to namjoon's un speech and ugh yeah this part fits my agenda without being moved by his words. gosh. https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg here is BTS’ full UN speech. Hope you learn to love yourself and apologise .
the inspirational UN speech... about HAIR PRODUCTS?! Maybe if they actually listened to it instead of making fun of them for their appearance, fans, number of members, language and everything else MAYBE their career wouldn’t be about to end in the next 2 days. also, bts gay
get that disgusting @20toOne video off my timeline the way this was actually broadcasted on television is beyond me. how are you going to belittle all of bts’ hard work and say stupid shit like how their UN speech was “probably about hair products.” please EDUCATE yourselves
I feel so angryyy like my mum called me OMG BTS ON THE TV as it’s not everyday bts is on the tv and what a dissapointment to have t h a t ( I’m just glad I was late and only saw the last 10 seconds) but their mockery of the un speech really had me like yeah? What are you doin
@20toOne Your little segment on BTS was nothing but disgusting and utterly disgraceful. The audacity you had to label their speech at the UN regarding the Generation Unlimited project as nothing more than promoting hair products was vile and downright demeaning. Trash.
Exactly exactly! It's not even about the group anymore! I don't want their topic to be about anyone! This is so uncalled for. And about that UN speech about hair products, are you fucking kidding me?? WHO GOES TO THE UN AND TALKS ABOUT HAIR PRODUCTS!
did they speak about the charity's armys and bts donate to? did they speak about how bts' lyrics have created a safe space for many people? did they speak about the actual UN speech, or the cultural merit? did they speak about their actual records? or bts being ambassadors of SK?
UN speech about hairproduct?? what the heck are you talking about?? " BTS support the launch of Generation Unlimited, a new global partnership to help every young person into quality education, training or employment by 2030" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
Yeah its awful. I recognise one of the comedians from tv in the uk so I knew he was a comedian and thought he would try to make a joke but this is just wrong. How dare they reduce Namjoon's speech at the UN down so it looks like he's only talking about fans. BTS spread positivity
what you did was shitty and unprofessional as fuck. i hope you realised that by mocking bts and what they stand for, you are mocking millions of diverse people who look up to them for support and comfort. their un speech was about human rights+ #20toOne
and even labelled us as “crazy fans” to literally sum up the interview straight up disrespectful and disgusting. You dismissed BTS leader RM’s speech at the UN by saying it was probably “About hair products”++
The song (DNA) the doofus mocked has beautiful lyrics, he just mocked the Korean language for its poetic ways BTS has tons of gender neutral love songs (i.e. Serendipity), and they wrote them that way on purpose (yes, by themselves), RM (the UN speech guy) talked about it.
Dear @20toOne @Channel9 You broadcast-ed a segment on BTS today which was appalling. You mocked BTS by saying their UN speech was about "hair products" and labelled them as "gay This was very xenophobic and homophobic Your info was presented in a way which was defaming BTS +
Also what is about the nonsense you guys talking about their Un speech? they were actually running a program for helping people? The disrespect is totally another level. Just apologize to the bts and army
Not to mention it's racist and dismisses their UN speech about helping at-risk youth, AND insensitivity towards North Koreans who have been executed for having kpop.
literally the only representation bts get in australia is the fanbase. presenters literally thought seokjin’s name was kim. but we get shitty ass features in 20 to 1 which are just blatantly disrespectful (referring to the un speech, jimin’s voice crack, asking if they were gay)
the fking stench of this video. perhaps this is why bighit won’t sent bts here bc we got stankass shows like this w people speaking outta their asses. the audacity they have to joke about their un speech being abt “hair products”?? https://twitter.com/jinsgrilledclam/status/1141299658091683841 …
bts are hardworking, supportive and above all DECENT people. like all others they make mistakes, which they acknowledge, if you’d listened to kim namjoon’s UN speech instead of just taking a clip from it to use out of context +
ARMERIES HELP US IN MASS REPORTING THIS NEWS CHANNEL @20toOne for defaming BTS, disrespecting NJ's speech at the UN, calling them gays and many more offensive remarks. THEY HAVE TO APOLOGIZ FOR EVERY DAMN WORD THE HAD SAID. Here's how to email BH. THANK YOU AND KINDLY SPREAD. https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …pic.twitter.com/c2aavhB6ws
I can’t believe in 2019 they’re still sick and racist fools like you. You totally spun BTS end violence speech at the UN into a joke and made stupid racist remarks about them. You even generalized the most diverse fandom into “crazy fan girls” You disgusts me
@20toOne you can say all you want about bts’ music, its not everyone’s taste. but being blantantly racist, connecting them with NK, discrediting their work and belittling their UN speech/work is absolutely appalling and i’m ashamed to be in this country full of xenophobic bigots.
unacceptable, we as armys and BTS deserve better than this. the report gave an improper portrayal that undermined their UN speech, unfairly judged armys to be of the “crazed fans” stereotype, and disregarded their performance skills. the entire segment was a complete mess filled
@20toOne Making fun of everything they do.Criticising BTS talent based on one performance. Making fun of army..All that I can bear, but cropping the UN speech to make it look like joon spoke only about the fans is disrespectful & unprofessional. DO UR RESEARCH U LOOK STUPID
so bts UN speech was about hair products, jimin’s voice is on crack, their vocals was “passable” and all their fans are screaming 12 yr old crazy girls okay karen.. we just clowning ourselves today pic.twitter.com/NsxQEzpBqc
You guys are disrespectful the way you reported on BTS. How you started the segment with N Korea was complete ignorance,do your research! And dismissing the inspiring speech at the UN was a missed opportunity for you as reporters to do an equally inspiring segment. Disgusted!
DISGUSTING, XENOPHOBIC, RACIST absolutely no research done @20toOne SHAME ON YOU UN speech about hair products?? Did you even bother to listen to one sentence he said? Hope you educate yourselves first then talk about BTS . THANK YOU.
i’m appalled by how australian television has depicted both bts and their fandom by editing clips such as the UN speech and jimin’s (one) voice crack to create a negative view - why bring d list, no name, probably still live with their parents celebrities to voice their opinion
Grown men can scream at their tvs over a football game but heaven forbid bts fans scream at a live performance, also the Jimin clip, imagine picking the one video out of hundreds where he’s having a bad day and basing his skill on that, don’t get me started on the un speech https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
it’s so offensive and insulting that they would undermine both bts and army, not only is their speech at the un a big deal but their campaign is changing the world and much more important than anything coming out of these “reporters’” mouths
@20toOne This is disgusting. Please apologize. Bts isn't even the first group this has happened to. They're so xenophobic and rude. Seriously, you're going to cut out the whole UN speech and say it was about hair products? Are you serious. And the fans are not crazy either. https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
some australian show talked about bts in the most disgusting way ever, diminishing everything they've done, even the UN speech. uncultured swines pic.twitter.com/H1MSquuW3J
this report is extremely offensive, there are so many unnecessarily insulting comments that really undermine bts and army. who are these people they interviewed?? especially that comment about their speech at the un...not only is that a big deal but they’re campaign is important
@20toOne Maybe if you actually did your research and listened to BTS’ UN speech You might learn something “hAir pRoDucTs” Stfu.
I feel in need to share again the UN speech since the recent event of that tv program dragging bts pic.twitter.com/ij28evIJXI
@20toOne You clearly have seen BTS' UN speech, but your segment definitely shows you didn't listen to it. Instead, you decide to crack a prejudiced joke about it. #Channel9Apologize
1. BTS has > 20mil followers on Twitter - almost as many ppl as the population of Australia- u should've heard of them by now 2. A Korean bomb joke= racist 3.That was a voice crack, rare and such a low thing to single out 3. BTS' UN speech was disregarded 4. We're not Homophobic https://twitter.com/australiabts/status/1141320166904496128 …
Namjoon and Bts’ hard work to give such a beautiful and impactful speech at the UN down the drain, and then to invite per/ez h!lton.... who’s been known to say disgusting things when it comes to b/ts/arm.y... like was there no research done here???? Truly appalling.
@20toone The segment on BTS lacked research and showed ignorance and disrespect. Disrespect not only to fans but also to BTS. Minimising a speech at the UN in relation to #ENDviolence Against Children campaign to "hair products" is not only unprofessional but also insensitive.
Sit down and watch Namjoons speech at the UN properly, sit down and watch all of Jimins performances, sit down and get to know who bts is and THEN go on tv and fucking talk about them
You clearly have seen BTS' UN speech, but your segment definitely shows you didn't listen to it. Instead, you decide to crack a prejudiced joke about it. #Channel9Apologize
@20toOne: insulting BTS and their fans, letting their bigotry guide them, laughing of the UN speech BTS and Army: supporting charities, donating parts of their album revenue to Unicef, helping launch a Campaign against violence, fighting against bias in the music industry
I saw only a snippet and I couldn't even watch another second of it, how can you be so racist and xenophobic on national tv. How do you have the audacity to spew random shxt about BTS and call it a day. They really said their UN speech was about hair products
wtf is wrong with australian tv... being a boy band is not synonymous with having crazy 12 yr old fans??? imagine not properly acknowledging bts’ speech at the un and instead saying their music sucks, they can’t sing and they’re gay? solely based on the fact that they’re korean +
fuck you and your racist insults about bts who the hell do you think you are to go and downplay the success that the worked tirelessly to gain butchering their names, insluting their culture, cutting namjoon's powerful and important un speech to insult the fans fuck u @20toOne
so basically some show called @20toOne said some disgusting things about bts like the UN speech was about hair products, their music is cringy and for kids, used a clip of jimins voice cr*ck and said armys were homophobes give an apology now you clowns
@australiabts hi!!!! if possible are you guys able to tweet about maybe contacting the show 20 to 1 and politely talking abt their disrespectful coverage of bts??? they purposely used clips of the boys’ voices cracking and mocked namjoons un speech!!!!!
uh okay then @20toOne ?? Let’s completely undermine how powerful and utterly inspiring bts’ UN speech was by joking about how they’re self absorbed and probably spoke about hair gel??? Weird flex but okay
whats the show about? my mum called me to come quick so i ran to the TV. then was so happy to see BTS on aussie TV but was kinda upset about the comment about their UN speech. can somone fill me in on what the show is about
Be positive, we can have also BTS speech at UN or even, if I dare to dream, about Chinese technological advances.
I feel a subject about BTS speech at UN last September. But why not D-day, it can be a great topic. #BacAnglais
Bringing this beautiful historic UN Namjoon Speech back on your tl bc it must never be forgotten. I tear up every time I watch it Thank you Namjoon, thank you so much @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/BE7UqxZ7DM
I became an ARMY this summer when idol come out. I started been interesting in BTS since i watched their un speech
Um...coz he stood out the most, the way he spoke and carried himself, his confidence. I wanted to become like him! His UN speech made me stan BTS
So she asked me, AF: did you watch the UN speech of BTS last night? Me: no! OH MY GHAD, not yet but I will. AF: bitch! you don't have time for BTS? I thought you were a "True Army"? and now you are not updated? girl! So fake ewwwww
JSSHSHSHSHSHS the show the return of superman used BTS's UN speech to show Gunhoo's multilingual babbling skills and they freaking added "no matter what language you babble in" BTS GOIN FOR THE BABIES' COMMUNITY pic.twitter.com/rajCS26lUQ

I didn’t take KPop seriously bec of the aegyo & factory reputation. Stanning BTS was a huge surprise. My Army journey started w/the UN speech. But I’m just a fan. Music critics have a job to do. Research! They prolly think it’s ok to sit this one out bec they’re just Asians. https://twitter.com/ontheflowerpath/status/1140957531772243969 …
Record Academy Members. Cultural Merit. UN speech. Wembley Stadium. Presented a grammy. BTS PAVED THE WAY.
YESS THE UN SPEECH FUCK IT UPPPPPPPP

BTS really taking over the world, the fact that they put bts’s UN speech is just so amazing
i was trying to get my one of my classmates in the korean language class to check out BTS and he said "oh ive heard of them! i saw their UN speech, and i know the guy's very smart" and like WHEW MY ARMY EGO
Wowww! TROS used BTS UN speech for gun hoo hehe soo cute
look mnet is such a fan of BTS, they're using quotes from Tomorrow and from their UN speech :((
they used bts's un speech in tros for gunhoo
I'm no company stan or whtever but I only blocked people if they attacked BTS, and I blocked her a long time ago. She's been known as an anti in this fandom since last year. I don't understand why you can say it and trust her that much AND she talked bad about their UN speech
Don't forget about Cultural Order Award, and UN speech. Don't be rude if he is rude with you. We are BTS image pic.twitter.com/9jAp7EhOFq
Apparently this baby and his sister are favourites with the show's viewers! I'm glad that they used the UN speech clips.
I'm watching a Korean show with my mom that features celeb babies called 'The Return of Superman' and it showed clips of @BTS_twt UN speech. The caption says that the baby should find his voice from within and babies are future's hope. (My mom is laughing in the background lol). pic.twitter.com/SixiBfM1pW
You mean,‘I’,you don’t speak for ARMY and BTS spread love not hate,go watch their speech at the UN and learn to be a better person online and especially in your life.
Their UN speech, their songs 2!3!, Magic Shop, Reflection, The last from Agust D and the whole mono mixtape
What is foolish about being proud about your religion, look at their UN speech, he wants us to speak ourselves. This is against everything they stand for
some girl made her parents react to expensive girl for laughs. like can we not give off that impression to people who don't know BTS. keep that in the fandom only. show them his UN speech instead Susan.
When a btch is making fun of BTS just show them these pics 1.BTS at great TV shows 2.BTS at billboard won 2awards 3.BTS at the Grammys 4.BTS giving a UN speech + they're not real friends if they don't respect your taste of music Purple you army sis pic.twitter.com/W42Tnd2kn8
I watch namjoons UN speech for motivation in life @BTS_twt will you please put it in the next album
Evry1(strangers/colleagues) dat I met in Stockholm & Paris who learnt dat I'm goin/went 4 BTS concert were like "oh, you like k-pop!?" or "BTS who?" Then I wld list out all their achievements, hardwrk, msgs, UN speech etc etc which left them amazed. No one was disrespectful.
She doesn’t like bts she thinks they are pawns that have no talent and lie. Case in point her saying RM did not write the UN speech. I’ll hate her forever for that. Don’t engage with her. That makes her so happy
A very interesting convo happened at my house yesterday while I was showing my family Moni’s UN speech. My mom absolutely loves Joonie! He’s definitely her bias but yesterday she saw Jin and was like “oh he’s so handsome too” Then my aunt said Hobi looks like a prince @BTS_twt +
PLEASE, if he hears that many people discovered the group after hearing his speech at the UN..... he would be so happy
Whenever I hear that someone dug deeper after seeing the UN speech I just.......... (ಥ﹏ಥ)
UN speech 9/2018. Magical journey everyday since @BTS_twt
I havent went to their concert yet..so my for now favourite memory is When they gave a speech at d UN @bts_twt
@mangobaaz - you should listen to RM's UN speech! And let me compare them for your understanding - Imagine our band e.g. "Kashmir" going to Billboards, Grammys, Stadium Tours, Topping On Worldwide Charts apart from cultural & language difference Now see BTS
Idol can be a bit overwhelming for the untrained eye, yeah! Glad you watched the UN speech that much I love it when ARMYs are created from that!
watching return of the superman latest episode but suddenly they show bts speech at un at naeun and gunhoo scene omg haha
When they won their first daesang , went to Grammy , and the UN speech
Coz Her was my first cb i watched every award show and saw them winning. Also UN speech that was a proud moment. I mean you know what i want to say. Thanku so much for giveaway. Stay happy and healthy
Please for the love of god, has this guy ever said a single good thing about BTS? His website even criticized Namjoon's UN speech so I honestly would take whatever he says with a whole bucket of salt
Gunho one of the kids on the TV show 'SuperMan's return' speaks three languages they used RM's UN speech with Gunho showing him following RM's steps and speaking at the UN too #RM #KimNamjoon #알엠 #김남준 @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/Endearing_Jin/status/1140410788655448064/video/1 …
When Namjoon made his speech at the UN and Seokjin releasing Tonight ;^;
They're also great and genuine people, they're UN ambassadors, are very active in philanthropy, and gave a speech about 'Speaking Yourself' at the UN. Basically many love them because they're real and are helping to bring positivity in peoples' lives https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
About to sleep but really quick, can CSG2 tell me how and when they found about the UN speech and what were their feelings? And also how they felt about the RIAA? Also how they got into BTS? Its for my speech that I’m very behind in....
Kekeke! The way @BTS_twt' UN speech was feat. in this clip of "The return of Superman" w/ lil' Gunhoo as RM...!!! ... (Aww, I LOVE lil Gunhoo! ) "No matter who u are, where ur frm...find ur name & find ur voice by Speaking Yourself." Link ~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQGObswYhI4 …pic.twitter.com/EvecnlhEQb
In oder, I listened to their album first. Checked out Idol mv then saw the UN speech, repeated severals times then tried more mv + live performance, was obssesed by BST:))))) Jimin was relevant!
My first MV it’s Idol but I didn’t have any idea ab members. They’re look similar and the MV is too colorful. The 1st mv that I had idea ab someone caught my eyes was BST. It was Jimin. But for I decided my bias before this, I watched UN speech and he was stuck in my head.
the fucking un speech. i remember ditching class n sitting in a bathroom stall to watch namjoon speak. i CRIED. i have never been so thankful to know bts in my lifetime or been so proud to be an army :( https://twitter.com/marveIjeons/status/1140087958424510464 …
OMG YES! Cause firts, I saw him at the UN speech and was like “wow, he’s so smart” and his words moved me... and them I saw him in the MV and was like “OMFG he’s so hot and his voice is so smooth and sexy”. He really is beautiful outside and inside
Even tho the news lately makes me mad, sad & frustrated, it did lead me 2 BTS via CNN coverage of Namjoon’s UN speech (Thk goodness) & this grt quote from SOH Pelosi which so accurately describes our Army. “Our diversity is our strength but our unity is our power”. @BTS_twt
they edited gunhoo over bts’ un speech LOL THIS IS SO CUTE I HOPE BTS SEES THIS??? pic.twitter.com/bgulgDeIde
you could bring up how bts was invited to unicef’s UN general assembly. namjoon’s speech (it’s importance and impact) and why it’s so significant that a kpop group was invited to the event

Grammys, un speech, Wembley, billboard awards, unicef/love yourself campaign, Halsey interactions , bts world osts and game stuff! These are just some things off the top of my head
kim namjoon sweetie i’m sorry this user doesn’t acknowledge your speech at the un, having to translate what the members say, you’re so smart wow iq 148 who produced each bts song wowww
I DID IT!! Kim Namjoon's Speak Yourself UN speech! Finally @BTS_twt #btsfanart #Namjoon #thankyoualwaysinspiringmepic.twitter.com/mqSoSz0aa5
Did he/she not read RM's UN speech? Did he/she forget that BTS has collabed with many black artists? Their music root came from hip hop a genre created by black people I...
@BTS_twt so you guys have bullies, stalkers, and now racist fans in the family. Telling black fans not to listen to K-Pop because it’s meant for white people only. These fans are TOXIC it’s truly disgusting how they can call themselves human beings. Rewatch their UN speech please
UN speech is my favorite way to introduce BTS.
as RM's speech to their at the launch of Generation Unlimited, at the UN General Assembly goes: "Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself. ",
.....we need love We need to love ourselves And we need to love others BTS are truly leading the way, with the UN speech and examples of humanitarian understanding for peace We are ARMY We are world
-Thread- After a recent break down, a lot of tears, and meaningful lyrics, I can now say I am finally ready to #SpeakMyself RM from BTS said in his UN speech that we should speak ourselves. I'm finally ready to share my life story. Something that's tormented me for 15 years. pic.twitter.com/PPr2Ux2kpA
Most definitely the UN speech and BTS+ARMY concert pics
Don't like BTS?? fine but don't talk abt their music u have never listen to, they're the only artist who told us to luv ourself, told us to speak no matter what our gender, nationality or language is(UN speech). Respect BTS, we will respect u back, don't make us to drag ur faves.
Mine started a bit different but the rest is accurate haha. I looked them up after the UN speech. I had no idea they had music, let alone multiple albums already. After the speech I found that same message in their music and thats the reason I stayed.
Mine was slightly different. I saw the UN speech shared by a friend late October. I half listened, decided to pay full attention then saw 진. I fell in love with him, fell down the rabbit hole fully and stan since then. I'll stan until the end, then stan whatever comes after.
Prize #1, My bias is Namjoon and im from Indonesia. My fav moment is when they gave speech at UN and also the MMA 2018 performance thankyou for the giveaway @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/QTBuODwdYW
Namjoon english skills n UN speech is the reason I curious BTS & FIRE made me stan BTS. War of Hormone 'Taehyung & his deep voice got me & he is my crush I love all of them deep
I still get goosebumps everytime i watch BTS' (Namjoon) speech in UN @BTS_twt
&excuse me but my favs ain't problematic. U putting namjoon next to this thing is so bold of u Last time I remember there are things bts did that ur favs didn't like being positive role models to ppl,giving brilliant examples and oh maybe speech to UN&be a recordingacademymember
Why did I forget who jungkook was for a sec and why does RM always sound like he is giving his UN speech and why am I hating on my bias?
OT7 forever, but I have an extra soft spot for RM as his UN speech in September 2018 was the starting point of my journey with BTS #teamRMonopic.twitter.com/HaJINayTUw

First I knew you from V in Hwarang,then I searching about you and fall in love with you more because Namjoon speech on UN. Now I LOVE YOU like crazy with you,all about you @BTS_twt. Happy 6th Anniversary. #BangtanAttic #6YearWithOurHomeBTS #BTS6YEARSpic.twitter.com/ssPdSPFDUM

this continuous journey because all of those me's deserve love. even outside their songs and all that bts still made me feel supported and loved. one thing that will always stick with me is namjoon's un speech, it really helped me so much in coming to terms with another aspect of
your first win, your first daesang, your first american award show, your first invitation to the grammys, your first UN speech, your first stadium tour. i’m so happy to have been a part of your most beautiful moments in life @BTS_twt #6YearsWithOurHomeBTS

but I’m going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, gradually, little by little. What is your name? Speak yourself. - BTS UN speech(2018) ❞
@Jormarie9 The speech at the UN no doubt
One of the most meaningful memories is when they made a speech at UN about Speak Yourself, and that's how ARMY from Vietnam had come up with an ARMY Song called Speak Yourself as an appreciation for @BTS_twt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvJfiwh-pW8 … #6YearsWithOurHomeBTS
In conjunction with #BTS6thAnniversary & #2019BTSFESTA, my 1st , I'm sharing the article that started it all. I was very, very sceptical about kpop but this article piqued my interest on @BTS_twt. The UN speech further increased my curiosity. https://twitter.com/wef/status/1101286003036377089 …
in 2018, BTS gave their speech at UN and I wept. their speech was so honest + exactly what I needed to hear to find myself again. before this, I had vaguely known who they were but had never looked into their music, their message, or even knew their names. +
there were two times that took my love for bts onto a whole another level with the first time being when #WhatIsYourName trended after UN speech bc it lit changed me on a personal level in terms of realizing that its ok to not always look strong & ask for help when u need it
These rookies never thought theyd make a speech at the UN, become Recording Academy members, be the best selling korean group of all time, debut 3 albums on the bb200 in less than a year @BTS_twt #6YearsWithOurHomeBTSpic.twitter.com/8CqJ1sh8Lg
To RM @BTS_twt Congratulations for anniversary 6 years Finally, you have proved to everybody see that you will succeed. You come so far more than I and you thought. All the time that I know you, I feel happy always. The speech that you gave in the UN, it touch my heart
BTS spoke against social injustice, encourages the youth to continue their dreams AND tell them it’s okay to now have one yet, namjoon’s speech at the UN, false accusations, fought against discrimination, plag*arism, proved everyone who doubted them wrong, #6YearsWithOurHomeBTS
I dare you to watch their UN speech, their entire sorry or success and say that again. For other kpop groups that can be the truth but you can tell bts are more than that because a lot of the subjects they talk about is taboo in Korea (antiestablishment) and would be +
Joon’s British accent comes out a bit and I literally teared up when they showed a clip of his UN speech. They have come so far and work harder than any other group out there. You nice. Keep going. #BTS #ARMY #Sugaisabornsinger #BTSatWembleyhttps://youtu.be/x5Nim22WaCs
@BTS_twt congratulations on another successful year together filled w/ love & happiness!

The UN speech made me an army, n I started watching dere mv's, run bts n started going deeper on the lyrics n all the theories. They ve made me happy, made me to start loving myself n help me through my tough times n depression. #6YearsWithOurHomeBTS @BTS_twt
My brother and my uncle introduced me to them.. they played @BTS_twt songs everyday.. they showed me that they are the first korean act who've delivered their speech on the UN+ #2019BTSFESTA #6YearsWithOurHomeBTS #RewindWithLuv
My favourite moment of bts is when they gave speech at UN! It's the greatest political and social platform ! I felt so proud of them! With their music they are braking all the barriers! If I bey mistakenly win I'd like mots!

mama end speech, UN speech, Run bts the end of season 2 (watched it rec. 18 times ), every smile, every happy moment of our boys
I think all of you have forgotten that BTS are UN Ambassadors whose message is to spread LOVE! They aren't just idols. They are a voice for EVERYONE who needs to hear they are loved! Not just ARMY! Did any of u actually watch and listen to RMs speech?
I came from the future to say that @BTS_twt made it!! They won billboards, they attended the grammy's, topped the US and UK charts, had a speech in the UN, made new recods and most importantly they are making history!! Celebrating their 6th anniversary at 12:00 kst!! https://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/344476376725876736 …
Same! I lurked on ARMY twitter for about 3 months after discovering them on YouTube, but I didn’t create this account until the day of the UN speech - I felt that I wanted to help make this historic moment trend and the speech receive more awareness. Never looked back since
@BTS_twt I’d like to win prize #1, my bias is Jimin and I’m from Spain. One of my fav moments of BTS is when they gave their speech in the UN and also when they win their first daesang at MAMA Thx for the GA pic.twitter.com/e0k9W0PQqp
I don’t rlly remember the 1st time I saw them but I remember scrolling through insta & seeing the UN speech. I was rlly inspired by them and decided to look bts up. After doing some research & listening to their songs, I realized I’ve listening to them before lol
I always feel that BTS words are too beautiful that their UN speech can plant a whole forest and save the Earth from global warming. pic.twitter.com/k85wq7oYLt
#1 My bias is RM. I am from Pakistan. My favourite memory is when they won their first daesang award and the UN speech of RM @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/y3VN7vL6Ur
USA. #MakeItRightForBTS this guy who always use drug and never have confident live with us and my dad was listening to rm speech at the un and he decided to give him his blessing and always pray for him and now the guys never miss church and always helping ppl in the street
It depends on what you take as your ah hah! moment, I knew about BTS since fire era but ignored them till last year when my mother got pushy for me to know them, decided to stan after the UN speech and chose Sept 29th 2018 as my army anniversary because of a Yoongi selca
Whenever I'm feeling sad I like to watch Namjoon's UN speech. It doesn't even matter what I'm sad about. Thank you Joonie! @BTS_twt
My bias is Namjoon if my whole profile isn't obvious enough haha. I stanned them right after their UN speech last year. It's so deep and hit HOME. It's so relatable to me and it helped me so much since then ಥ_ಥ pic.twitter.com/RPMW6sw02R
how bts impact my life? girl tell u what, joon's speech in the UN about speak yourself? rly work on me, they did something to my life. i used to be so afraid to speak my mind bcs im afraid ppl would take it wrong and bcs im afraid of rejections so i chose to be quiet +
The way @AdeleRoberts interviews with them is honestly so amazing! She asks the questions we all want to know the answer to, includes parts from the UN speech and spoke to fans. It was so in depth, the best BTS interview!!! Thank you
if you are a fan of bts and you are still not believing that namjoon himself wrote the UN speech, that bts are not forced to do most of the things they are doing, that bh “controls” their life. then you are not a fan really
How BTS @BTS_twt impact my life? the song 2!3! , magic shop ,so what, The LY tour, Namjoon speech at UN, how Jungkook started to work at very young age, etc. They inspired me to be the best version of myself. and i will never stop to try to be the best version of myself.
@Herld__ my favorite bts moment is speech UN
i can say BTS have a big impact to my life bcs of them right now i can slowly love myself. especially when namjoon speech at UN and talk about love ourself from i realise we have to love ourself before we love someone else. eventho is still try to love myself i just wanna say thx
My friend who discovered BTS and looooove the RM speech in UN wanna wear my prestige BTS jacket from the pop store, he loves that!! I'm proud #BTSWORLD #BTSinParispic.twitter.com/yEoT99WNB5
HOL UP KAY YOUR SIDE ACC HAS THE @OF THE BTS TOUR NAME — jfewijfeifj i managed to get it the day of the un speech hehe https://curiouscat.me/btspins/post/898489874?t=1560197636 …

One of my favorite BTS memories would definitely be Namjoon’s UN speech. I remember because i just felt so proud and touched by his words. #BTSMEMORIES @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/bEnUR2ArHz
Well he did say that he prepared Joonie for the UN speech
Hi Anya! I became an ARMY after their speech at UN HQ about their Love Yourself campaign partnering with UNICEF. It really hit me hard because i can relate to the message of their speech so much. It's like the speech was personall made for me pic.twitter.com/QKZzPoaB6b
hi name is kim namjoon and hes the leader of bts!!! although he spits fire, he’s a gentle giant who loves tiny things. he gave a speech at the UN, encouraging everyone to speak themselves. his message that he wants to display is to try to find and love yourself through life! pic.twitter.com/bLFS1vTFgR
wanna write my world history final on bts and all they’re doing like breaking a bunch of records and what their music talks about like the important messages that they talk about, their un speech and stuff so that i will actually like doing at least one of my finals
I've a lot of great memories with @BTS_twt one of it is Our President #Namjoon giving speech at UN will always be the special one. At that time my friends, my parents and even my teachers praised them I can't say how proud I was as an #ARMY #BTSMEMORIES #BTSMemoriespic.twitter.com/uEFL1CWSJ2

There are so many amazing memories, UN speech, BBMA best group win, great songs and performances esp. MMA perf., funny RUN BTS moments, that MAMA speech,This @BTS_twt story as a whole is the best memory #BTSMEMORIES
O9/24/18 BTS addresses UN General Assembly at New York City and gave their speech that aimed at empowering the youth and encourages to "speak yourself". We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to “speak yourself.” - Kim Namjoon @BTS_twt #BTSMEMORIESpic.twitter.com/N1xxpMuzvs
one of my favorite bts memories would have to be when they went to the UN and Namjoon gave his speech. I was so touched by his words, that I cried. @BTS_twt #BTSMEMORIESpic.twitter.com/07oEY4QlzJ

One of the most beautiful BTS memory that I have is our seven amazing men going to the UN and Joon giving such an inspiring speech #BTSMEMORIES
One of my favourite #BTSMEMORIES was when Namjoon gave his speech at the UN. Each word that came out of his mouth had so much meaning to it. I felt so proud of him. [ @BTS_twt] pic.twitter.com/OxEr7Bz3Mf

bts helped me to find myself, to love myself and to speak out. namjoons speech in the UN was the most inspirational speech i’ve ever heard. not only that, but their music, their music has such a strong meaning that touches my heart. thank you bts
Reminiscing the song that led me to this fandom.... Heared this right after falling love at first sight with namjoon during his UN speech. #BTSARMY #lovemyself @BTS_twt @bts_bighitpic.twitter.com/xvYeYBOQMY
My favorite bts memory is them going to UN to give a speech #BTSMEMORIESpic.twitter.com/SnDumk77vb
my mom is promoting bts to her friend on the phone rn she’s got all the talking points down, positive message/influence UN speech and amazing music + performances omg this is truly the best timeline
This is the same person who came during UN SPEECH, being one of the Presenters during GRAMMYS AWARD, same person who won two categories on BBMA, and the member of RECORDING ACADEMY.
aw my mom has been reading articles about bts to get to know them......she mentioned the un speech and i was like?????????
This is dads reaction to the UN speech. It was so so pure and I am so proud of him ): ‘If you’re ever in a dark place watch this’ UGH @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/quJEiXOvBH
Boyinaband's video on BTS is well thought out! Like, he really looked into what makes BTS successful compared to other groups and is asking us why we support them so much, he even watched some of the UN speech which I'm so happy to see. For once, a video on BTS that isn't clout.
the first time was when they were gonna make the un speech she was out for her lunch break and she saw bts crossing the street and the second time was gma like r we kidding she doesn’t even stan
its not bad but not mindblowing. the whole video is him trying to understand why bts got so big. he watched the un speech and said some nice things abt it too
and she said that s*okj*n cant sing, shat on joon’s un speech, draws nsfw of bts x bt21, makes fun of armys, made that fake s*saeng airplane video
BTS UN speech left a huge impact to me and it shows. it should show. #WishTreeForBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/GGufZ0YNx0
Hi Puji! 1st of all THANK YOU so much for this GA! I became an ARMY right after BTS' speech at UN HQ about their Love Yourself campaign partnering with UNICEF. I could relate to what Namjoon said so much. It was such an eye opener for me personally. Here's how pic.twitter.com/Oue9gRe6xd
I searched an ot7 photo and he zoomed to Namjoon. He talked about how he recognized him because he saw BTS' UN speech and grammy interviews. (My friends is an environmental voluteer and creates music too so he's really aware of these)
And I've never been to a concert yet because i only started stanning last year, but watching BTS and Namjoon's speech at the UN was really memorable for me #ARMYVu
Hi first of all thank you for the GA! I discovered 'em last year after the UN speech during their UNICEF Love Yourself campaign. The speech really hit HOME because i can relate to it so much! Here's a full story on how i became an ARMY after the campaign @hemasari @KoyasBabiepic.twitter.com/wRneCTb5gt
I discovered them last year, right after the UN speech during their Love Yourself campaign partnering with UNICEF. It really made a huge impact to me personally, which turned me into a full blown ARMY pic.twitter.com/raoY1etsmA
So, like.. You guys remember jimin's reaction to namjoon's UN speech? Yeah, well.. It just keeps on replying in my head like "MOOD" rn . @cafe_army, you right. RIP translators. A.R.M.Y will not forget y'all's sacrifice towards this cause *salute* .
Stay MAD sis BTS also writes, produces and creates melodies to THIER own songs. They have been spreading positive message within their lyrics, tour, UN speech etc.. their music has positively impacted millions of people around the world. They DESERVE this pic.twitter.com/bSqrXN4D8B
This pic literally screams Princes of pop Time’s top 100 most influential people Invented by Grammys to be voting members Held a UN speech Honoured with Cultural merit Sold Wembley x2 x3 n1 albums on BB200 x1 n1 album in the UK BTS PAVED THE WAY @BTS_twt #2019BTSFESTApic.twitter.com/0eTPhdsTXZ

In 2018,a day whn I ws hurt,troubled,tkn fr granted,demotivated-I decided 2 giv up on everything as no 1 wld love me d way i did,I stumbled upon RM's UN speech & learned to LOVE MYSELF.dat made me an ARMY..BTS is daily motivation, happiness & strength fr me #ARMYVU @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BangtanTrends/status/1136996232285474816 …
At first I listen to other K-p0p group but once my brother and my uncle introduced me @BTS_twt song, their speech at UN and their performance on BBMA, AMA and other tv shows.. I start to listen to them casually+ #ARMYVu
GUYS 107.5 KLOVE started talking about BTS this morning and how much they appreciate their message of people loving themselves and they played a clip from Joon's UN speech and it was EVERYTHING Mind you this is a SPANISH STATION IN LOS ANGELES it's a BIG deal! pic.twitter.com/XKcYOsR4KW
If I had to say everything I have to say about being an army, and how I felt the first time I saw them, it's just, wow, endless. The Love Yourself Era, the UN speech, all the memories, the vlives, the little moments shared, the april's fools. I just love #ARMYVu @BTS_twt
Me talking to my friends: Namjoon is the leader of BTS. His the best leader in this world. He had a speech in the UN. He makes music about selflove, mental issuess and- #BTS #rm #namjoon #BTSWORLD #DreamGlowOutNow Meanwhile RM:pic.twitter.com/3xDPeHAH50

i don’t know how people can say things like these with their whole chest. bts is on the level of the beatles, have held a UN speech, are members of the grammys academy, are amongst the top world stars, produce bomb ass music, win award after award... army and bts stay winning.
Stadium tour, charting positions, invitation to Grammys, being members of the recording academy, them enduring hardship and staying together, UN speech, BBMA performance, BBMA wins, our strong bond with BTS and BTS’ love for each other.
army: Im so proud of bts, the biggest boy group in the world, delivered a speech at UN, received the cultural merit medal, unicef ambassadors, grammy nominated, members of the recording academy, 5.8 billion spotify streams bts: https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1136988826210131968 …
-that up) bts did a un speech, donate on unicef and A LOT LOT LOT more plus the fact that they encouraged us to love ourselves, who does that? none other than bts
the fact that BTS always sends us positive messages through their musics, taught people to keep on dreaming, speech at the UN and making billions make me realize that my whole life was such a mess since i cant even boil a water properly
Not Today and BTS UN Unicef speech
I don’t understand what’s wrong? People quoted BTS’ old tweets this during the Grammys and UN speech as well..
Thank you bts you inspired me to speak myself and share my story , (I make bts refererences “that’s why I want you to speak yourself” (inspired by bts UN speech) pic.twitter.com/sCN5ZGqzdU
It’s how their names are spelled in English, when they came to the UN to give their speech that’s how their names were spelled too
2013 BTS -AFTER 6 YEARS- -awarded of cultural merit award -ambassador of UNICEF -featured at TIME magazine as most influential people -had speech in UN -top billboard charts -part of Grammy recording academy as voter AND STILL SAYING WE ARE STILL THE SAME BOYS FROM 2013 pic.twitter.com/ubhQvWm3ma
My favorite moment with bts is when they did the un speech because it was such an important event to army and bts and everyone all over the world because people from all over the world came into one room and listened to bts and truly understood why we love bts
Award winning songwriter, producer, and artist. UN speech giving humanitarian. Leader of the world’s biggest musical group. Complete and utter doofus. And I love him so much because of it @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/UgA3j6rr6W
Some people need to give themselves a reminder of Namjoons UN speech especially the last paragraph. Don't call yourself ARMY and then go against everything BTS stand for #LoveDontHurtpic.twitter.com/EfXi8vHfjb
1st of all thank you for the giveaway! My most fav moment of BTS was when BTS delivered speech at the UN. It really meant A LOT to many of us, especially me, because after that speech, i became an ARMY. Here's a reminder on how good the message was https://twitter.com/monosrap/status/1093164712169070593?s=19 …
6 more days until bts anniversary namjoon has taught me to be leader and to always smile even if the others are crying. Namjoon is one of the many reason why I still live today..each speech that he gives teaches me many lesson. For example, the UN speech. #BTSFesta2019pic.twitter.com/KXj6eruhp8
Speak Yourself: RM BTS are well known to be supporters of the LGBT+ community & Namjoon’s speech at the UN only further cemented that fact. So it was only fitting I include his words in something this month! #BTS #Namjoon #SpeakYourself #Pride2019pic.twitter.com/3DRfzAiOQN
I know i will be bashed for this but-- We dont like it when someone uses actual bts crying pic as a humour. We avoid doing this. Then the same energy should be used for bts UN speech. its an important thing for us and we should not take it lightly for sake of joke.
I actually started interested in them because of the UN speech and started stanning the because I saw some bts universe theories on my pinterest kskdjs
Hi! For me it ain't a song in the 1st place but when I read CNN's tweet back then, tht BTS (RM) dlvrd a speech abt ing ourselves at the UN. The moment I watched, I fell in . After tht, I asked my close friend, which songs she d to hear from BTS & I fell in love even more
@BTS_twt I ANALYSED YOUR SPEECH AT THW UN FOR MY ENGLISH FURTHER ORAL ASSESSMENT AND MY TEACHER SAID IT WAS EXCELLENT I LOVE U GUYS AND ANALYSING YOUR SPEECH MADE ME FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER TO U GUYS
20% of the proceeds will be donated to BTS’ Love Myself/End Violence Unicef campaign in the name of BTS & ARMY. The backing card features a quote from RM's inspiring UN speech. These pins will be available in our next tba shop update. We hope u guys love this pin as much as we do
bts: recognized by Grammy enough to be invited. By billboard to win 2 times. have 20 daesangs, do a speech at UN. sell out wembly MetLife Soldier field Black: pink
lmao we did almost the same thing- but I started to stan after the UN speech!
I'm from The Netherlands, I found BTS through the UN Speech. I didnt know they made music, let alone they already had multiple albums and everything. I went to look them up after watching the speech, on Jins birthday so I will not forget that day!
I shared the UN speech & videos of Young Forever at Wembley on our Family WhatsApp group as I wanted them all to see why we love our boys so much,the connection we have & how inspiring they are. Then even if they don't like their music,they might at least understand that. @BTS_twt
We’ve been showing clips when we can until we’re told to turn them off . My mums not racist with it either phew, she had tears at the mama speech and I caught her bopping to bepsae so it’s slowly working lol. She would never admit it though! Great idea re UN speech!!
My mum does like some of their songs but she has made some comments at first,not racist but also not worthy of repeating.She seems more respectful too.I showed her the UN speech as it is so thought-provoking and inspiring and shows the messages our boys spread through their music
Totally agree. We all love army no matter who you are where are you from gender, races. We are one(cited RM’s speech at UN)
@BTS_twt I used Namjoon’s UN speech for my graduation quote pic.twitter.com/GHOGWOnjwI
It is surely when they gave speech at UN! It's such a huge politically and socially relevant platform!! Like literally my parents started to validate my love for BTS after that! And their achievement thereafter!!
i talk to them about the msgs behind map of the soul since it was sooo connected to our lesson, i love how they all so active and excited hearing my stories about bts msgs and i let them have reflections on namjoon's speech at UN. y'all i'm living as army for life
i’m so sorry that said that, i’m sorry that they don’t unserstand. maybe you can sit them down and explain why bts means so much to you? like maybe show them joon’s un speech.
I’m guessing he didn’t know how BTS was not a mere boy group that sings and dance, that they helped people that struggle with themselves (UN speech, Unicef campaign), and how they inspired us to help Mother Nature, etc.
I heard that UN speech and I’ve been saying Kim Namjoon wants us to rise tf up, BTS gave us the green light let’s goooooo
My Korean teacher is this older lady who isn't into Kpop and "modern" music and stuff but when she saw BTS she said that something about them was different and she really likes them. She even mentioned the UN speech. It's so cute how she talks about them! @BTS_twt #BTS
My favorite BTS moment has to be when they became the FIRST K-POP group to give such a powerful and meaningful speech in the UN that was directed to teens about loving oneself and speaking themselves. #pennpuff1stgiveawaypic.twitter.com/xr8jEKwu3m
Summoning Joons speech at the UN for tomorrow!! @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Well BTS actually Collaborates with UNICEF on 'Love Myself' Anti-Violence Campaign ,, 3% of the income of BTS album( love yourself) will go to the children who need it -Watch RM speech in the UN it is inspiring
BTS: Talk about ending bullying, make a speech at the UN about that same subject Their fans: this headass shit
Armys finally a good article frm French Press. Talks abt the +Ve message BTS spreads, Speech at the UN, Jin’s charity donations & how Speak Yourself tour has raised $2m saving 340,000 kids in Yemen. It also highlights their achievements being the first SK band to sell out Wembley https://twitter.com/Le_Figaro/status/1135791054526001152 …
overview: so bts honestly changed my happiness i became much happier knowing that these ppl who wouldn’t know me personally would be there to support me with their music. they changed my mindset they made me more open minded. the un speech made me appreciate more things in life

everyone does mistakes in their past. What makes someone knowledgeable is how they make up for it. They’ve talked about their past many times apologizing and doing more. Their UN speech, lyrics, and the books they read show they’ve LEARNED not only apologized for their errors
+ The women looked to be around 60 years old, so we made sure to tell them that it didn’t matter how old you are, where you’re from, or what music you like – you just HAVE to check out @BTS_twt’s UN speech. They seemed to really respond to that. They promised that they would!
As much as i love BTS since 2014, pls dont come to Malaysia. BTS deserves better. Most ppl here dont care if bts donate for cancer, respect islam, talk about abuse, study, mental health, give speech at UN or give scholarship.

when #BTS giving speech at UN in front of the world leaders and the world, you spreading hate on twitter, come on, let’s be logic here. thanks to me you got one attention. sad one.
We would still love them if they were bald. They make music that speaks to us and teach us how to spread love and love ourselves. Please don’t reduce them to ‘pretty boys’ because that’s not even close to to the truth. Listen to RM’s UN speech as you will understand who they are

Hello I know it's impossible for you to see this message but I need to express my gratitude. You started in 2013 at that time you never thought you could fill the biggest stages of the worlds, make a speech at the UN, be the representatives of UNICEF ... But nevertheless you
A late answer, but namjoon.. I've already been pretty interested in, but even more when I found out about his UN speech. I ealized that he's compassionate man that is trying to change the world little by little through bts's music bc music really transcends lang, race, color, etc

namjoon said bts will succeed naturally and people will not expect it back in 2015, look at them now, selling out stadiums worldwide, millions of fans, millions of albums sold, unicef campaign, UN speech, SNL, they deserve everything
as RM's speech to their at the launch of Generation Unlimited, at the UN General Assembly goes: "Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself. ",
it can be in any shape huh? you found them, them finding you or the both of you meet halfway, stumbling across their UN speech or their music. when you need them the most they'll be there telling you to not loss hope and lend a hand to help you up @BTS_twt
omg you should listen to bts' leader, namjoon giving speech in un
Welp, bangtan's effect though Mnet has been using BTS lyrics & even their UN speech in Produce X 101 and turns out even their director motivates them by telling to work hard so they can go to billboards too. Ah, i feel so proud @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/8UhPVQZVHp
Remember when Joonie said this at their UN speech; “If there’s anything that I’ve achieved, it was only possible because I have my other bts members right by my side. And because of the love and the support that our ARMY fans all over the world made for us.”
HAHAHA dudeee wth, finally & this man is exactly like my dad. he took interest in BTS after namjoon’s speech at the UN
So..I was just testing my HDMI cord to connect my laptop to our tv for I’ll be streaming Wembley later w/ my sis,I was watching my BKK fancams until my DAD asked what’s up&we FINALLY introduced @BTS_twt formally to him. Look at him CLAPPING AFTER RM’S UN SPEECH Y’ALL HE KNOWS pic.twitter.com/ADmvbvg2if
no, but really even my mom and senior colleague know about BTS since RM made the UN speech.. they were impressed https://twitter.com/AureliaOT7/status/1134370878903336961 …
I was working and two korean ladies in their 70s came in and as soon as they heard bwl play, one of them were said "oh this is a bts song. Unnie do you know bts?" And she started talking about their achievements on billboard, speech at un, uni profs referring to them +
Listen to his speech again at the UN bring tears to my eyes. How proud i am of him. @BTS_twt bring positivity to the world with their music and messages. They are a great role model for this generation and future one. People need to hear this #HappyNamJunepic.twitter.com/hSLsjuAuoX
I used one of his quotes from his UN speech as well yesterday as a farewell for my peers in college hahaha RM would be so proud!! Congratulations!!!
I was just watching your UN speech! I can wait to see you at the concert tomorrow!
Armys spread with comments with explanation about BTS deep songs, their charity work, UN speech,6 years hard debut ! 5 years Trainee etc.. fill deep songs with explanation to their hate comments!!!! Don't fight with them
This is their UN speech https://youtu.be/jMGEGAGymrg
The first BTS MV video I watched was Boy in Luv in 2014,,,,,,, I didn't like it at all. If someone would have told me back then that these same 7 guys would attend the UN General Assembly 5 years later where their leader would give a speech, I would not have believed you at all
ARMY the fans. They write, produce, perform their music amongst many other things they do for ARMY. They were asked to speak at the UN where the leader RM did the speech as the group have united with the UN to end violence against children. All this and the eldest is only 26
namjoon is my biggest inspiration. everyday i get to learn from him and he keeps me motivated smh. the UN speech, the writings he does for us on fancafe, his mixtapes, lyrics, his hardwork and talent, just Him.
Not only my idol but also my inspiration Inspired by RM’s speech at the UN General Assembly, we wrote this song for BTS, for ARMY, and for everyone who is struggling in finding their own voice. @BTS_twt https://bit.ly/2Nvs38K #HappyNamJune #RM #Namjoonpic.twitter.com/rjMmCITKlp
My moon, my president, my inspiration The person whose UN speech drag me to the fandom. He is the reason I'm ARMY today Thank you sooooo much kim namjoon I love you kim namjoon @BTS_twt #HappyNamjunepic.twitter.com/thoIOjvWmT
#HappyNamJune everyone! Let's bring back this powerful UN Speech by our leader, Kim Namjoon to celebrate this special month! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ue8zPfBZhV

Let’s start the month of June with BTS x UN speech #HappyNamJunepic.twitter.com/3uP9CaWQnh

bts is a korean boyband, they spoke at UN speech. pic.twitter.com/AfX66Hl45K
Hi, I am 35 yo...a dentist and a mother of 3 baby..i almost forgot how to enjoying my self since I have 3 kids. Then one-day I see BTS at UN speech on my local news..got curious until I heard their song lyrics "you tough me I have reasons I should love myself"
Wow, congratulations on your accomplishments! I’m glad you included Namjoon’s UN speech!
I wanna top my class just so I can speak infront and qoute a BTS song lyric or Joon's UN speech. HA HA HA chereeeet
Everyone is their target age group. I'm 51 been Army since before Army existed. @BTS_twt are amazing talented young men, humble, & loving. They are so much more than a pop group, they are social activests, they give so much back check out RM's UN speech. https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
ever think abt how bts went to the UN. for their project with UNICEF against child violence. and they gave a speech in front of world leaders to advocate for the youth....like. that was a real thing that happened. https://twitter.com/alezander/status/1115024197053345792/video/1 …
Suggest you take a look at their concerts and listen more their music... various,deep and magnificent, especially their lyrics are really inspiring !The leader RM even had a speech on UN last year!
Some "topics" is taboo in Asian country like Korea. But since their debut, BTS has always been talking about issues such as mental health, depression, social anxiety and several other similar topics. They had a speech at the UN conference last year where they talked about +
I don't think anything bts do from here on out will ever have me as nervous as their UN speech
https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156?s=21 … here’s the speech they did at the UN!!
I know the comment was without hate, here you have their speech in UN if you're interested. https://twitter.com/athopeworld/status/1134210057753702400?s=09 …
They even gave a speech at the UN. Try checking out that too . They do a lot of charity work and they are incredibly humble .
i’d start with bts’ music like ‘mic drop remix’, ‘fake love’ and ‘blood sweat & tears’. the mvs on youtube have english subtitles. also bts talk a lot about social issues. here’s a video of a speech they did at the un last year https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156?s=21 …
actually, most of us are adults with proper careers and/or working towards it. ironically enough, bts are the ones insipring the youth to do something with their lives and love themselves. If you listened to their UN speech even, it would be very eye opening, its sad that
The PRINCESS OF THE POP, Made a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, have a look , thank you @UNICEFhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
@cristmadrid93 I love BTS because love yourself and UN speech, the amazing music and MV theories @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Fi39UjGldh
He replied that he had listened to the UN speech, and felt proud of namjoon, and happy that such youngster like bts exist to spread positive message. Spell proud = ME. Thats all i guess. I told him bout bgt today, dont know if he ll watch our boys. #BTSonBGT @BTS_twt
Well she bombarded me with tons of questions. I did answer them all to the best of my ability and told her he is Kim Namjoon also known as RM of BTS, the biggest group on the planet this moment. I showed her his UN speech. She was really impressed by it!
damn i was watching pdx101 n i was getting emo then suddenly this quote from bts' speech in the un appeared :---( makes me so proud "sometimes, i wanted to quit. but i was lucky to not give up." pic.twitter.com/RjwV7huKNF
Who:BTS 1st who caught ur attention:Jungkook First Bias: Jungkook Bias Wrecker: SUGA Current Bias: SUGA Year u stanned: Oct 5, 2018 How did u know them: i saw RM speech at UN then boom,i was doomed Fave songs(atleast 3): Magic Shop, Boy with luv, No more dream @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/wKtpE7FIKt
As Jin said: we are family. A well-read family! Even if Jimin couldn’t even read Namjoon’s entire UN speech without shaking his head at least he has “not recommended books”!
#BTS appeared on the #UN homepage! BTS sang "World Peace" with album #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA and #Boy_With_Luv . "We want to spread happiness and hope in this world... #Love_Yourself!" The video also included the BTS in the #UN_speech last year. http://www.hanteonews.com/ko/article/all?c=294 …
@BTS_twt So, I'm talking to an acquaintance for a project and I sent a BTS picture as an example. She didn't know anything about BTS... So, I linked her to the speech in the UN. BTS speech at the United Nations-https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg (I'm excited how this gonna turn out)pic.twitter.com/5ostrtJC8A
bts continuously making their music an all-inclusive space through using gender neutral language, making it a focal point in their UN speech, & now making the bt21 characters non-binary, means SO much to me and proves we stan the right people. i love and appreciate them so much
what Jin means BY JIN in BTS FESTA? What made BTS name their tour SPEAK YOURSELF? How is it related to their UN speech? Do they watch BTS crack videos made by their fans on YouTube? Does BTS know about the fan fictions?
This is literally my mum’s face going through this thread I finally got the chance to show her BTS’s UN speech and a bunch of their videos She said RM stands out to her I guess we call that a bias Mom!!! Y’all Army’s are the best. Issa win pic.twitter.com/B46SpxWGQN
people still think bts r problematique after joon’s un speech?? couldn’t be me
Please do not ask them about dating, collaboration stuff. Just ask them about Love Yourself Campaign, UN Speech, About their music & lyrics.
It's 'bare minimum' only when it comes to BTS. They've literally openly talked about it, even in the UN speech, but what's ACTUAL representation/advocation for LGBTQ+ rights is your fave wearing a rainbow shirt, correct?Then they're woke, accepting kings & queens. Fuckin clowns.
Feeling that same feeling when Namjoon mentioned gender identity in the UN speech.... and the same feeling when he would clarify "girlfriend OR boyfriend" when asked dating questions in interviews... Same feeling. My bisexual, non-binary self is SO FUCKING HAPPY.
Why does google keep recommending me articles aboout BTS' net worth? Who the f*ck cares? Have you heard about their UN speech or any number of charities they support? #MTVLAKPOPBTS #MTVLAFANDOMBTSARMY #MTVLAINSTAGLJUNGKOOK #PremiosMTVMIAW
BTS is just out there finding ways to make space for marginalized people and letting them know they love them and respect them. Lyrics and interviews? UN speech? LINE friends alter egos??! They don’t have to but it’s clear they *want* to and it means a lot.
*taken from his speech on 24 September 2018 at the launch of Generation Unlimited, at the UN General Assembly
And ARMYs out there, let’s just leave positive comments on his tweet. Let’s not give him another reason to hate us even more. Comment BTS songs, MVs, perfs, UN speech and the like. We mirror BTS. Let’s make the boys proud of our actions. Love myself. Love yourself. Peace
in all honesty i don’t think i would be where i am now without bts and their music. their message to their fans and the un speech really impacted me and i couldn’t have been more grateful. although they don’t know each and every one of their fans they make sure we are all happy
was rewatching bts' un speech and i kinda wanna change the world
They are a Korean group of 7 members. They make songs about serious issues like society judge, politics, mental health, growth, self-love etc. They and their music have helped many people. They also participate in charities and had a speech at the UN in 2018
On today's episode of "The cutest Army Mom in Canada" She has hung up the @BTS_twt posters I gave her alongside RMs UN speech pic.twitter.com/NMIQE1kYXC
Ask from RM about Persona! Ask about UN speech,deep message of their songs(paradise)ask about mv storyline!Don't ask about dating, collab,food, we heard 100 Mill. Times,if you ask that i will sue you
Failed as parent ? So tht mean you are succesful enough to say this kind of thing. If you are succesful enough. Can you beat Namjoon IQ or does Dior make special outfit for you or does UN invite you to give speech ? Hating on a Bts doesnt make you any better.
@BTS_twt BB Top Group BB Top Social for 3 years Named as the pop princes Selling out stadium tours Being able to deliver a UN speech Best selling album etc. BH fam is now in london for the presscon before the sold out concert in wembley... @hitmansonline @hitmanb how you feel?pic.twitter.com/cSMCrwfTca
Yes, this is exactly what happened 2 me a 57yo mom. I saw Namjoon’s speech at UN on CNN then wondered who r these artists? Then started my journey & my heart grew more purple w every step. I’ve never felt this way abt any other grp n my life & feel blessed 2 b Army @BTS_twt
Asked Them about there bonds and Teamwork they do.. Asked about there music.. UN speech. Love yourself concept and now Speak for yourself concept . Ask about there lyrics .. How they get motivated. And all. Pleaseeee.. ..
it'll would be glad that if you ask them About their UN Speech and deep meaning of their love to their fans (army) and mostly themselves i want to know if they success to love themselves after they told us their fans to love ourselves. Hope u ask this thanks!
I wanna thank RM for the UN speech. That speech made me re evaluate the way I love myself. And Thank you @BTS_twt for being an inspiration to so many individuals myself included. My question is what advice would you give yout 10yrs old self??
I beg you, Please DON'T ASK about collab. food etc. Please ask about UN speech,about new album their songs Persona, Home? About stadium Tour??music video story line?
Ask them about UN speech, will they do another campaign with UNICEF?
un speech. end violence campaign. meaning behind their lyrics. stuff like that please :(
please don't ask them about collabs, don't ask them if they date, don't ask them about their favourite british food. nobody cares. ask about the records they've broken, the impact of their UN speech, the message of the album. please.
Please don’t ask about collabs or if they’re dating. Ask about their album and the music making progress. Ask about their UNICEF campaign, their UN speech, their bond with one another. Thank you for interviewing them btw.
ask Namjoon if he wrote his UN speech before finalizing the MOTS album and if so, did he change any tracks to fit what he said more.
The Speak Yourself Tour is linked to Namjoon’s speech at the UN: apart from love yourself and speak yourself, what other messages would they like to give young people (if any)? What has it been like working with UNICEF?
don't ask about collabs PLEASE WE BEG YOU PLEASE ask about namjoon's bonsai, UNICEF, their speech at UN, the message of this new era, their WORLDWIDE SOULD OUT TOUR, their individuals donations etc PLEASE WE DON'T WANT EMPTY AND FOOL QUESTIONS. thank you

I had a counseling earlier with a pastor and we talked about my problem and also i told him about BTS being my escape then he asked me about bts and i told him about where they started from the bottom and now still humble and that they had a speech at UN and he was so impress-
My most memorable moments in ARMY twitter in no particular order. 1. Jins birthday celebration when he joined his own cult. 2. UN speech when we were all so nervous and speak yourself trended afterward. 3. First BBMA and AMA. 4. When BTS won top DUO and we all cried. @BTS_twt
When they gave a speech in the UN! PROUDEST MOMENT
so i added this filter on namjoon’s un speech AND HOLY PRESIDENT KIM NAMJOON THE YOUTH NEEDS YOU @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/mVs1vFi3nO
Wow! Could a “news organization” be less professional? 5 mins. of research could provide ample samples of music, charity work, & speech to the UN. & provides the most basic overview of their actual message. That host/team wasted of a lot of money and a great opportunity.
the one time i decided to not go to school, they turned on BTS's UN SPEECH to teach on leadership skills ? and i oop- pic.twitter.com/gAbh5sZPn9

I really enjoyed your childhood story on the UN speech vid. I feel you look happier than months ago when I first watched your BU vids. I hope that's true. U smiled entire preUN vid. Wld you consider talking re how becoming ARMY has affected your life? New outlook bec of BTS?
Anyone else cry when he said his most memorable moment was when BTS delivered their speech to the UN

This is absolute. I went on depression. I was so lost in life that I was thinking of giving up but then I saw RM's speech in UN and it sparked something in me.

As an Australian I am disappointed by the lack of research that the reporter put into this and hope next time he uses greater journalistic integrity. They have more adult fans than “children fans” and he could’ve included their UN speech or their Sold Out World Stadium Tour. Thx

You can't judge BTS by their fanbase. Yes, there are toxic fans but there are also amazing fans. In this post, you are only talking about the fans, so why do you disrespect the boys. They haven't done anything wrong and thats why many people look up to them. E.g their UN speech.
RM’s UN speech was significant. Kim Namjoon, or RM, said he'd always remember who he was as a boy living in a city he grew up in. There's a stage name & another real name, the 2 aspects of his personality, but said he was determined not 2 lose himself in his public role. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nupJtXPD3s

omg blt sandwiches hahaha best comedian ever!!!! bts are so relevant that they gave a speech at the UN. They were invited to the Grammys, their album cover was nominated, they were part a photoshoot that only winners get to be apart of. Their name is associated with the Beatles.
URI moonchild. Joonie your speech in UN is so incredible. I am so proud of you the man you are, you inspire me everyday.
i just read the whole speech i wrote down the day bts spoke at the un... this is better than anything i've ever written in school i'm

And I did. My father sat down too while holding his plate and that was the first time we sat as family tgt while watching something and we watched the UN speech of BTS. If you're Asian and Filo, you will need to understand that that scenario isn't a typical household scene here+
OT7 . I never knew how much I needed BTS. They have changed my whole perspective on the world. I want to be able to create change with them. My dream is to become a speech pathologist so I can help people speak. RM’s words from his UN speech inspire me everyday.
I actually heard dope when it first came out. I got interested and was a lil into BTS but later forgot about it since i didn't have access to social media. Later, i rediscovered them after their speech at the UN. It really inspired me and i looked more into BTS
#DearNamjoon I watched a snippet of your UN speech again, I started to cry because I realized you @bts_twt have set me on a road to loving myself and speaking up for myself more (even though I didnt realize it). Like you gradually little by little I am learning to love myself +
BTS is much more than just "group of boys with pretty faces".Their music addresses the social and mental health issues faced by youth.See their UN speech before judging them #BTSOurMuhabbat
I found them at the end of 2018. At first I only saw a few clips, later I found out they were clips from Run BTS and Bon Voyage and things like that. Watching those clips led me in the end to the UN Speech. Thats what pulled me in actually. After watching that speech, +

favorite bts memory from the past year was the boys making history at citi field OR joon’s UN speech. @kpopwhom
my mom showed my dad a whole bunch of bts interviews and the UN speech bc he was being ignorant about them and I DIDNT EVEN ASK HER TO LMFAOOO
@BTS_twt hinting us since speak ur self in UN and they remind us again in billboard acceptance speech for TOP DUO/GROUP... we r going to turnback in time this time in 4.0 version. And ALEXA pls play euphoria in a mega MAXIMUM volume. I'm scared for this festa y'all!
It reminded me again about the note in Epiphany and BTS UN Speech; how they told us to find direction in our life and also told us they also used us to find theirs "Where's your soul?

Yup. There was no way in 2014 could I be convinced to listen to KPOP. If not for the UN speech I wouldn’t even be curious about BTS. Thankfully I’m more open now (but I still listen only to BTS other than my rock faves). Who among the members tweeted it?
I aint wishing EXO to disband & Fcck anyone wishing that but Susana its 2019 and you think BTS is in Exo’s shadow?

I didn't give up tho. I did an assignment about Namjoon's speech at the UN and then I presented it to my class. I spoke with all my heart about who BTS were and how they are braking so many barriers with just their music. One girl that had told me before that BTS weren't worth of
that bts also spoke at the UN about very important matters such as violence and freedom of speech and that they encouraged me millions of people, including me, to follow their dreams cuz life can be as amazing as you want it to be and guess what. Nobody believed in me. I
Like how BTS wants everyone to love themselves first before they love others. At first, I watched their message at the UN. I was so moved by their speech, I even cried. At that point I started listening to their album Love Yourself: Answer ...
The lyrics goes like this "you've shown me I have reasons I should love myself" I asked my friend what is the title of that song and she said "Oh that? Love Myself by BTS" she even added their campaign and speech at the UN...
When im feeling down, i will just go to youtube and watch RM/BTS' speech at UN
"Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults, tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser and that's me too" — Kim Namjoon （from Namjoon's UN speech @BTS_twt）
hi @BTS_twt, I asked why I didn't know what my passion was. see you who have passion and achieve it I become jealous. but after seeing the speech at the UN, I now know that I am very passionate about cooking, thanks for everything, my Anpanman #LoveYou20000000pic.twitter.com/OaA9ypQHiw
Kim Namjoon has made so many beautiful speeches which people are touched by in tour concerts, press conferences, interviews with media, at UN, at Vlives.. And amazingly, every single speech has been different, never been same. I hope @BigHitEnt will make a book and publish it.
Love you #남준 #Namjoon. Your beautiful speech at the UN was what started my interest in @BTS_twt. Since then I found #20MillionReasons to love all of #BTS. See you soon at Wembley. #LoveBTS20Mhttps://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1132204292666998786 …

worked so hard and you can see and hear the growth in every album and now they’re still just in their 20’s just being bts while breaking records doing a speech at the un and just bring awareness about different topics and also bring enlightenment like before the album i never
@KHOP951 You guys support @UNICEF . don’t know if you guys knew that my boys @BTS_twt also partnered with them. They raised up to 1 mil $on the #ENDviolence campaign. Donating a % of their album sales as well. Making a speech at the UN conference. Pls play #BoywithLuv pic.twitter.com/XzQ7bNY8To

Many were interested in the HU Cultural & Arts Operation program after the post. OP recommended those enrolling to learn about BTS first, because all the professors LOVE to use BTS as case studies They watch Namjoon’s UN speech and discuss in depth abt bts marketing and ops https://twitter.com/seokjinbaobao/status/1131921259288121345 …pic.twitter.com/b66o4SaWXW

Although the UN speech made me a fan, I think So Far Away, Daydream and Moonchild are what made me pay attention to each member as individual artists, with their own styles, quirks, and forms of expression, as well as one group that brings all of that together. @BTS_twt
mia, biolet and i are watching save me 2 and they talked about bts and namjoon's UN speech, we stan pic.twitter.com/aTc8XCSPcd
Like all their album records, unicef campaign, lyrics, how small bighit started, the monetary value of bts, awards like the cultural merit and others more, the UN speech, their tours and how they sold out like literally it was ALL THERE I can’t even type all of it

I love how Mnet uses so many quotes from bts in Produce X 101. first from Joons UN speech and now lyrics from 'Tomorrow'
ละเค้าก็พูดอีกว่า I taught the lesson about the culture before, so I took BTS to show as an example. Also, the one who have a speech at UN. ก็เลยบอกไปว่า me too, I watched it. ทีชเชอร์ก็ถามว่าคนนั้นชื่อไร นี่เเบบ his name is rap monster เอ้ย RM 5555555555555555555555
Don't expect people to know who BTS are and always explain it in a crisp concise way without overwhelming them. (Cheat code- mention the UN speech to anyone over 30, it alway helps).
I think only one person asked them about Speak yourself campaign and RM was like "tysm for asking that precious question you are the first one to do it" I forget the interviewer's name but that guy was there at the BTS' UN speech as well.

I went to babysit my cousins for a little bit and my auntie, who watches a lot of kdramas and stuff, comes back and tells me she’s getting into BTS now. She said the UN Speech spoke volumes to her.
The other day I was reading lyrics of their older songs again. You can feel that all these words are truly theirs because they are pefectly coherent with their most recent lyrics. "It makes my heart race Makes me excited It fills my heart all day." Reminds me of the UN speech!
Sharing my graduation cap with my ARMY fam! Inspired by Mikrokosmos and Namjoon’s UN speech. Our constellations are made up of many Mikrokosmos, and this is just one of many! Thank you @BTS_twt for being my inspiration in ways you can’t even imagine (it’s also on my uni’s IG!) pic.twitter.com/vLdYEdZfci
the article was actually kind of okay, it provided good basics for bts and hyped up some good things like joons un speech and their bb achievements but the headline is a huge turn off
so yall know how im writing a essay on how BTS paved the way now im adding i segment of Namjoons UN speech skskks
"Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’s me, too" -Namjoon speech at UN @BTS_twt
The guy I'm dating kept asking me to explain how bts are influential so I did the most logical thing and whipped out the UN speech which resulted in hearing how Tae sounds in English which resulted in hearing Fake Love which resulted in him asking if Joon said "good man" or not
I was watching Save Me 2 and they were talking about BTS and The speech Joon gave at the UN. (Although they were talking about BTS in creepy circumstances lol) pic.twitter.com/spRNWLFXsO
I know the exact date I looked them up for the first time since it was on Jins birthday haha, and I know it was after I saw the UN speech, but thats it. Before I did see some clips but I had no idea about their music and when I saw them for the first time xd
Very recent! I am a massive fan of Halsey. Halsey sort of intro me to bts. But before that I have my eyes on Namjoon because of his UN speech
True love first begins with loving myself _ Our president Namjoon ' UN speech #MTVLAFANDOMBTSARMY #MTVLAINSTAGLJUNGKOOK #MTVLAKPOPBTS #PremiosMTVMIAW @BTS_twt
how is it an obsession lmao im sorry western artists dont have super passionate fans like kpop artists do. how do you think bts had the chance to deliver a speech about loving and speaking yourself at the un?
It's difficult to explain my love for BTS to older people because I feel they judge that I am an almost 40 year old devoted fan of BTS. But I just started telling them about their music, philanthropy, their UN speech & involvement in the End Violence campaign,+

oof dad messaged me on family gc (duh there's only 3 of us) told me that he saw bts un speech on tv, but then again he treat my interest as a phase https://twitter.com/btsdalbit/status/1131542676937961477 …
So I was talking to a guy I know about bts and this happened with another girl who was standing nearby Me: Excuse me sir my mom is an army Girl: Oh? My mom watched Namjoon's UN speech and went "I approve" Me: My mom and I are joon biased Girl: Good. *fist bump*
u got this, dont be nervous THAT IS THE WORST listen to bts songs, om god it helps and remember - namjoon gave a whole ass un speech his hands were shaking and he was nervous but made it AND U CAN DO THE SAME AND SHOW MISS B WHATCHA GOT
I’ve made up a small “BTS business card” with song suggestions (the YouTube links) that demonstrate their vocal and rap chops and, of course, their amazing dancing. Plus RMs UN speech so they can see there is more to them than what a first glance might reveal.
+ people who were casual listeners first, and only later became really devoted fans. Plus, seeing as Namjoon's UN speech is one of the most impactful things I've ever heard, it always makes me so immensely happy to hear that people decides to give BTS a go after it.
Yeah me too... But tbh i love bts more now im sorry top oppa ‍ bts hardship + their positivity drawn me more towards them. And how bts is invited to un to give a speech really blow my mid since then i decided im army.
it’s BTS!! they’re a group from korea that sing, rap, and dance! they help write and produce their own songs and have such inspiring messages such as loving yourself! they even have a speech at the UN. the most humble and cutest boys. they were who i saw in chicago
Tell her abt UN speech Show her Answer : Love Myself lyric Show her MMA 2018 Who Are U performance Show her Airplane pt. 2 MAMA 2018 Hongkong performance Show her some crackheads videos to seal the deal @BTS_twt Army, don’t forget to stream https://youtu.be/XsX3ATc3FbA
@bighit u make bts look bad by capitalising their un speech into ‘u need a bag with hoodie’ merch galore
I should pursue a career in media. If I were lucky, I would ask them about something important like the UN Speech. Namjoon said “Speak Yourself,” & it literally became the title of the new tour. I want to know what’s next for the campaign and what we can do to help. @BTS_twt
Thank you for this great interview Ryan! I loved Joonie’s answer about his UN speech, he’s really smart and I’m so proud of them @BTS_twt
Finally listened...thank you Ryan for such a great interview with @BTS_twt . I love how you mentioned their UN speech and their Speak Yourself message. I appreciate the important questions And yes, I wish RM can be all of our therapists #BTSonSeacrest
Y'all i was tired with my dad saying bts suck and are stupid , so i made him read the UN speech. He is jamming to Boy with luv now, Honestly , What goes on... pic.twitter.com/NwPEQkH6mu
Ah the UN speech
That's because majority of army tries to carry on the positive msg bts exudes. Of course not all of us are perfect so we check each other out. Time to check their music, or at least their UN speech.
actually such a cute fun and interesting interview. they talking abt the album, collaboration with halsey, relationship among members, UN speech .. Ryan even said RM could be his therapist . I love it #BTSonSeacrest @BTS_twt
we could chant abt anything we want, mate. bts giving a speech about self-love in un is still an achievement no matter how 'corrupted' un is as you say. bts was there to promote self-love and their love yourself campaign, thats it. nothing wrong abt that, mate.
Seeing BTS in concert. He asked who they were so I started talking about them (my husband even knows a little about them bc of me); I brought up that he should watch the UN Speech that was given last year, several songs (I wish I could remember the ones I gave him to listen to)
i mean ok un sucks but you cant just drag bts for giving speech about speaking up about yourself
the UN's reputability is without a doubt questionable due to their lack of action regarding the human rights issues going on in the middle east as of the moment. however bts' speech was directed for the youth and encouraging self acceptance and self love, which has no correlation
Not at how locals are tired when we bring up namjoon's un speech everytime they talk shit abt bts,,, i mean WHAT DO YOU DO SUCCESSFULLY HUN???
are u really......blaming bts' un speech......for the israel-palestine conflict...... https://twitter.com/syedumarsn/status/1131182375734353922 …
Thank you @1027KIISFM for the @BTS_twt interview #BTSonSeacrest I liked how you asked about their UN speech. That speech means a lot to me. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
That means, you need to watch ' @nbcsnl', ' @NBCTheVoice', ' @GMA', 'Billboard Music Awards', 'Grammys', ' @colbertlateshow', ' @latelateshow', ' @JimmyKimmelLive', ' @FallonTonight', ' @cnni' for their @UN speech, and etc. And, you will now start to receive lots of tweets about BTS
i’m going in for an interview tomorrow morning & my anxiety is getting worse the closer it comes but i just always remind myself that joon himself went up & spoke his long un speech by himself. As long as bts are by my side & teaching me, i think i’ll be okay @BTS_twt
imagine relating bts' speech for the Youth Summit to the israeli-palestinian crisis, which is supposed to be handled by the UN security council, another branch of UN entirely ??? https://twitter.com/syedumarsn/status/1131182375734353922 …

to fight e/o when you heard abt being able to go to the interview. you are no part of army, you are a disgrace, you brought shame on us. you have no idea of the point of end violence, nor the UN speech or any of BTS's msgs. you sadly are the type who are only here for the looks
I don’t talk about bts anymore but i gotta say; He has an iq of 148, held a speech at UN general assembly advocating the end of violence against youth. leader of a kpop group taking the world by storm, whose songs he co-produced mind you, https://twitter.com/uwumbi/status/1130768795922919425 …
I'm 33 and never liked a boyband. BTS for me is just an amazing artist. Diverse discography, beautiful lyrics, socially conscious, lovely personalities and they give back. Here a part of their UN speech. pic.twitter.com/OmmcALElDh
I'm so proud of @BTS_twt , they always be killing the game, and deserve to de called legends. Namjoon, or Rm, really did helped me a lot and grow a lot since the UN speech, I'm so inspired by everything, just wanted to say thank you, I purple you
What are you hoping ARMY takes away from experiencing the Love Yourself Speak Yourself Tour since the name derives from the UN speech? What does the tours name mean to you?
about the message "speak yourself" and "love myself" and the UN speech

Thats ok Youre missing out on a very talented group of men They not only sing, write, produce, play instruments act dance but spread positivity throughout the world Check out their speech at the UN I dont know how anyone can not appreciate them Even if its not your type of music.
It has been a tough year but I. MADE. IT!!!!! RM’s UN speech made me realize what I should have been focusing and what I should continue doing - loving myself for everything that I am. They probably wouldn’t be able to see this post but... 고마워요, @BTS_twt ! pic.twitter.com/LzjwsGs6Lh
This man right here works so hard. He produced & composed 90% of BTS discography. A leader even tho he was still a child himself. Made a speech at the UN. Improved alot over the years. Diverts stereotypical ARMYs. And carry so much at a young age. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED pic.twitter.com/iTE6G4IoyE
Off the cuff I could come up with one question per member : how much of MOTS album was done when you did your UN speech and did your speech/reaction cause you to change anything you already had down. How has no one brought up the speech as it relates to the album?!
Just found this video reminding of the UN speech I love so much and this comment. I am so proud to support them. Because I feel supported as well in my daily life. I don’t think I am part of the LGBTQ+ but I am so moved to see this. https://youtu.be/_txUkVrf8yA @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/aujqz8mqwv

Someone post the Un speech in his mentions to show him WHAT EXACTLY BTS is promoting
RM, your UN speech deeply resonated with LGBTQ+ people of colour armys. just want to say we're thankful for this inclusion. #BTSOnSeacrest
Since @UNICEF #ENDVIOLENCE campaign and their speech at the @UN as well as their personal donations, do we see in the near future of them doing more when it comes to saving the world and making it a happier place ? #NYCxBTS #iHeartBTS @Z100NewYork @PCRichardandSon
i got to talk to my mom about how loving and authentic and beautifully joyful bts are and she wants to watch namjoon’s UN speech later
Y’all wanna lose that? My friend Wes made fun of me for kpop and then he sent me the video of the UN speech and said he understood why I loved them. Little girls at my summer camp called my kpop boys girls and laughed at me for liking them n now they have crushes on BTS.

dont forget ., these boys who speech at UN
@BTS_twt I just want to say thank you for your speech at the UN! I know I’m not a teenager but your message really hit me hard. I was in denial about my weight and didn’t really care to love myself. The speech along with the song Love Yourself
Got BTS and Namjoon’s UN speech on my cap :) @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/fB2hF3DOwj
I watched their "flinch" Video with James Corden on YouTube. It was around the time when they went to the UN. Namjoon giving the speech SOLIDIFIED MY ARMY SOUL. #PremiosMTVMiaw #MTVBRKPOPBTS #MTVBRFANDOMBTSARMY @BTS_twt
And I disagree with you implication that “having women scream their name” is symptomatic of successful masculinity - they may not be gay but another huge appeal of BTS’ image is their presumed (from UN speech etc.) support for LGBTQ - not caring about gender orientation of fans
I’ve know them since 2014 and became an army after their speech at the UN. Before that I just listened to their songs and didn’t think what about their lyrics meant. I just liked the beat. But Namjoon and his words are changed me and my opinion. From that time I’m absolutely ARMY
Today, UNICEF posted a clip on Youtube about BTS UN speech and work, how are these goofballs the same people I just saw on that video! The duality #BTSatMetLife_D2 #BTSatMetlifepic.twitter.com/nPxBxOziSi

has anyone done a remix of bts's music w a voiceover of namjoons UN speech ,,? imagine its power ... 2!3!, young forever, run, etc mixed wistfully under namjoon calmly saying: "I would like to begin by talking about myself. I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea." ,,
BTS didn't went Only BTS get invited at Grammy Only BTS get invited at BbmA Only BTS get invited at UN speech Only BTS get invited at graham norton Only BTS get invited at Colbert Only BTS get nominated for bbma To collect awards
iya deh terserah kamu bts ga paved the way tapi BTS THE FIRST KOREAN GROUP: PERFORMS AT AMAS, BILLBOARD, SNL WINNERS AT BILLBOARD: TOP SOCIAL ARTIST 2017 2018 2019 TOP DUO/GROUP 2019 SPEECH UN PRESENTING AWARDS AT GRAMMYS HAS STADIUM CONCERT IN AMERICA AND EUROPE
not to be an annoying ARMY, but I really suggest you look in BTS' love yourself message and watch their UN speech. The leader RM is a great speaker and I also recommend you watch some of his other speeches at concerts
Oh...Yeah these are the men who gave the speech at UN..Who are known for breaking records and paving the way...yeah you are right they the exact same men....AND WE LOVE THESE DORKS.....

Maybe you went too overboard with the entire life thing for sure. They are changing the world. UN never called Taylor to give out a speech like they called BTS just in a pace of 2 years of worldwide success. They are now part of curriculum in Berkeley.
The officially posted FB videos have the best engagements I've ever seen BTS have on a non-stan page just after the UN speech though
update: I've started bothering my cousin with bts stuff and she asked me to show her the UN speech :(
Produce X 101 always uses BTS UN speech or BTS's songs as quotes every singles episode I watch and it honestly touch my heart, it got me thinking "Ah...our boys are already there.."

Just want to let you know that I'm over 50 and enjoy BTS's music. It's sad that you felt attacked but that does not represent all fans. BTS's message is about love, see their UN speech. I have attended 3 concerts and all the fans were pleasant.
my friend is tweeted that she's liking bts and she said she was amazed by namjoon's english in the UN speech ... my man's power only The Kim Namjoon
@BTS_twt are the Daenerys Targaryen when it comes to titles in real life. Before they are introduced, presenters go: “international superstars, first kpop act to give an UN speech, first kpop act to achieve 3 BB200 num 1, first kpop act to sell 3+mill albums”
@whoever the FUCK told tae to leave cuz of his skin getting dArKeR. NAMJOON LEGIT SAID REGARDLESS OF COLOUR OF OUR SKIN AT THAT UN SPEECH. WHICH BITCH DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THAT? Theres no bts without tae, and its as simple as that. pic.twitter.com/4LLp8tzJhS
It's the second time I see quotes from @BTS_twt on @mnet_produce101 This year! First it was from their UN speech and now from Tomorrow! #BTS #PRODUCEX101
It's the 2nd time I saw BTS' words quoted by #PRODUCE_X_101 1st was RM's speech in UN. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/4Qps23ZVKY
Sept2018. Was never into KPop. Got curious abt the UN speech. Checked the speech; then the Jimmy Fallon guesting. Then the music videos. The lyrics. The message. Run BTS. Their personalities. #PremiosMTVMIAW #MTVBRKPOPBTS #MTVBRFANDOMBTSARMY @BTS_twt
Ingot intrigued when I heard that a Kpop group would talk at the UN and so I watched their speech and was fascinated by their message and started looking them up... and that is how I fell in love with the 7 members #MTVBRFANDOMBTSARMY #MTVBRKPOPBTS #PremiosMTVMIAW ( @BTS_twt)
This is me when I talk about bts... and not just how cute they are but their impact like the UN speech and the UNICEF campaign and the messages in their songs..... I shouldn’t apologize but still, I find myself apologizing...
I am still waiting for another UN speech from BTS this year so that I cant stop bragging to myself that I have raised them well and they make me proud pic.twitter.com/VFTFIAp8R3
I'm a 52 year old Aussie Grandma who lives in New http://Zealand.My 15 year old daughter has been a huge fan for ages but they got my interest when I heard Idol.I love their energy and positive messages for their fans. Namjoon's speech at the UN was inspiring too.
Must use RM not NamJoon or Joon cause he”s name is spelled as NamJun (UN speech, BTS WORLD..) too. So many ways to call RM makes him harder to get higher ranks.
produce x 101 has been featuring quotes from bts recently :"-O last week(?) A quote from namjoon's speech at the un general assembly was shown and yesterday's episode featured a lyric from Tomorrow
Im rewatching bts on lssc and it hits different when stephen colbert himself states the facts (ie over 10 mil albums, un speech, 3 no 1 albums...) lol Also he’s hilarious twas a jolly great show
done. his speech at UN "... no matter who you are, your skin color, genre and identity, just speak for yourself" @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/VH9x9O7u06
Produce 101 quoting both BTS' lyrics and UN speech because of how meaningful they are @BTS_twt really isn't your average boyband
Dude u have no idea what u're talking about. These guys even were invited and gave a speech at the UN because of their conscientious and inspiring lyrics in their music that has helped many all over the world Please do some research before you dismiss a band for being a boy group
+ things you already knew but just didnt stop to ponder for a while. That's exactly me. If you havent gotten up to Namjoon's UN speech yet, its worth your time checking it out. I got struck down by the question, WHO ARE YOU? Brought me back to when i started to dream and left. +
not at me mentioning bts's speech at the UN and their end violence campaign to my friends dad when he asked me why i like bts gjdkfjdjfj i feel like a fb mom bragging about her kids
Hi Drew. I was born & raised n Tampa & miss it so much some days. Loved ur podcast re BTS & I became Army at 57yo after hearing BTS speech at UN. I emailed u yesterday but expect no reply only wanted 2 send u some vids that helped me know more abt BTS formation & depth @BTS_twt
if BTS can get another chance to make a speech at the UN again, and this time the topic is about women, women's rights, how a woman can join in a competition and how women should be respected. And that's time i'll be crying out loud idc pic.twitter.com/cJkJ0aoiZx
This makes me feel like how Jungkook once described you giving the UN speech, Namjoon.. like you and bangtan are big people now.
This is not cute nor funny. I’m pretty sure you have decent wifi in your office or home. Try using google and research on who BTS is, what is their music about, what message so they want to convey, their work with UNICEF and their speech at the UN and more. This is a mess.
I hang on his every word. His UN speech was the first time I ever saw him, and I became a BTS fan right then; without even hearing their music. After hearing their music now I’m more like disciple than a fan
"Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself. Find your name find your voice by speaking yourself." -RM of BTS UN Speech pic.twitter.com/TQYp0NI0p7
happy they mentioned the un speech
I have seen Produce X 101 since Ep 1 and have found that Mnet always used quotes from BTS like quote from UN speech, Tomorrow lyrics.
Couldn't recommend you their speech at the UN enough. It really shows what they stand for and why they're so important in today's day and age. We're not comparing them to the Beatles, we're pointing out their cultural impact and why it's similar to beatlemania. Peace and love
Ask from BTS educated questions,not who would collab shit please,we are tired from these question,there already long lists,who are american artist, wanted to collab with BTS Please ask about behind the song meaning of Persona,their old songs, UN speech,charity work,donation!!
This gives me the UN Speech vibes. Thank you for sharing your story. Just do you. Words to live by.
produce x101 really pulling lyrics from bts songs and their UN speech to encourage the trainees,,, phew the relevance
I hate this guy in the drama so much, but anyways.....BTS!!! They even mentioned the UN speech adsknslaknxkjs i stan legends pic.twitter.com/CBYcTTTv5D
I think its name from NJ What is your name speak yourself UN speech OMG I AM GOING WEMBLEY BUT I WANT THIS BANNER SO BAD!! Its such a creative idea!! Armys are awesome Hope the interactive banners works out! Have fun everyone and take pictures of the banners for me haha
My one year experience with BTS as a fan...it consists of many sweet things...I am very proud of them..I have seen their UN speech,Grammy appearance, Culture merit,Bbmas..and many more great success..I will love and cheer them for the rest of my life. #1YearWithTear
In his UN speech namjoon talked about that it doesn't matter your sexual orientation,he recommended the song "same love" which talk about LGBT,at this point you're just a hipocrite,you're against same-sex marriage yet support BTS when they support LGBT
This will be the second time Mnet quoted BTS on Produce X 101. First, it was Joon's UN speech and today it was lines from 'Tomorrow'. These type of small surprises fills up my army heart to the brim. pic.twitter.com/JjJr903B6W
His UN speech was very revelant.
“RM gave a speech at the UN and it was pretty good” ok even the evil Choi Kyeong Seok approves of @BTS_twt lol but i’m pretty sure he’s only doing this to lure Kwang Mi 아이구 THIS TWO-FACED MAN #SaveMe2pic.twitter.com/XovBZihgVt

im bout to make my grandma react to the un speech i hope after she watch this she'll like bts and support me lmfao
just being curious with them during their speech on UN. and then I found myself searching their music videos on yt started following them and twitter. I found happiness with them. I super love them and this fandom.
The message behind their songs help me with my depression, their UN Speech n Epiphany that tells me to love myself #MTVLAKPOPBTS #PremiosMTVMIAW @BTS_twt
-what happen with you guys... Please, omg are you serious that yall the same person who speech in un, the way you made me burst in laugh and another your 'normal' behavior but i still love you so much so i dont care if yall going like that....
Haha on the latest ep.of Save Me 2,the girl says she likes BTS and the man says he was impressed by RMs UN speech. The girls bias is Jimin
President rm and his un speech
Finally, it is okay to apologize, say you made a mistake, rather than hide behind cynical sarcasm. You know why BTS is so popular? Because they are sincere and authentic and always work to learn from their mistakes. At least watch their UN speech https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
My work was accepted in a congress right? I was able to use a bit of Namjoon's speech at the UN assembly. This is a bit of a thank you to @BTS_twt for making me happy. #BTSArmy #RMpic.twitter.com/XEZ5Usy2K6

@DrewOnTheRadio Hi I’m a Tampa native 2 who fell into the magical world of BTS when watching CNN report in 9/2018 when BTS leader RM gave speech at UN. Its been best adventure ever & this 57yo Mom is proud 2 b Army. I sent email 2 acct u mentioned on ur great podcast.TY @BTS_twt
#BTS @BTS_twt mentioned in Save Me2 kdrama : : And which Idol do you like : ..BTS : Mh Bangtan ? They do have good songs : Sir you know bangtan ? : RM's speech at the UN was nice since then I got interested in them ++ https://twitter.com/__moss/status/1129172254950952962/video/1 …
Ahgsgs this made me remember the UN speech bdbdjdj s proud of my boys @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/_txUkVrf8yA
So in this drama the man said he took interest on BTS when he heard RM UN speech and that they have a lot of good songs and then the girl started saying she likes jimin and bst https://twitter.com/__moss/status/1129172254950952962/video/1 …
in case you guys couldn’t guess, I am THAT chaotic student who writes abt bts every chance she gets,, going thru my school google drive and so far there’s a paper on go go, n.o, and a paper mentioning the un speech
BTS’ interview on The Late Show is now trending #5 in the U.K. @colbertlateshow @CBS #BTSonLSSC Thank you @StephenAtHome for the quick sum up of @BTS_twt’s recent chart achievements, their UN speech and their inclusion on TIME 100 Watch here: https://youtu.be/LiyPWH6Gm3U pic.twitter.com/rlXsMAbzLU
rmr when we always used to complain abt how the korean gp esp netizens didn’t know or care about bts in the slightest .. they gained the respect from their actions nd messages like with spring day & the un speech and the amount they’ve done economically for the country
If u care 2 know more abt BTS, chk out vids: BTS’s UN Speech 4 UNICEF campaign http://youtu.be/BF5ZQ1loXVQ & Nobodies 2 Somebodies history http://youtu.be/8XxYHkGM_lA & Hardships http://youtu.be/NidD1d73tXI Btw,BTS fans r all ages, races, genders, speak many languages, inclusive & openminded
someone else is maybe more likely to do something positive as well?! While listening to your podcast, I had to think about Namjoon's UN speech, have you heard his speech? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg … I was really touched by his words & incredibly proud. (...)
Remember when Namjoon's speech at UN Please ARMY, we are family.. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg #MTVBRKPOPBTS #MTVBRFANDOMBTSARMY #PremiosMTVMIAW @BTS_twt
if media is not going to do proper covers by itself, we should make them cover. some little steps can be seen, they are finally mentioning the UN speech and putting them in the league with the Beatles but we know that this, for now, is only because of the hype
BTS giving speech at UN https://twitter.com/EbonySapphire/status/1128770286558564353 …
I’m 57yo & The Beatles were always n my life never thought I would live 2 c this happen again till I saw BTS’s UN speech. So much 2 admire abt 7 SK artists who were nobodies that became somebodies thru talent, hdwk, grit, passion 2 make music 2 help others https://youtu.be/8XxYHkGM_lA
You should watch their UN speech https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
lrt is my mom who claims not to care about bts but paused their jimmy fallon interview to say joon deserved to go viral, watched the un speech on her own, and when my brother got me the bts book as a gag gift the other day, stopped me on his page and said "he's my favorite!!!"
BTS is amazing They write/produce music, play instruments, dance & spread positivity throughout the world I hope everyone who doesnt get the hype take time to translate songs listen to the @UN speech Really see why they are where they are today & how hard they worked to get there
thank you to stephen colbert for having bts on the show and for the amazing interview! he spoke about many of bts' acheivements, including their UN speech and kept calling them a "global supergroup!" this makes me so proud as an army to hear that on tv! #BTSonLSSC

Can we take a moment and appreciate how good Colbert was during the interview and he mentioned BTS SOLD 10M ALBUMS, BTS GETTING #1 ALBUM 3TIMES ON HOT200, UN SPEECH, TIME MAGAZINE...ETC., REALLY LOVED HIS EFFORT TO KNOW ABOUT BTS THANKYOU SIR. #BTSonLSSC
The performance was AMAZING. The interview super cute. However I wish they were asked about the message in Persona, or about the context of their UN speech #BTS @BTS_twt
Get to watch the interview. They are dorks. But they are my dorks and I love them Thank you Mr. Colbert for mentioning their UN speech,their hit tour and their millions sales records. @colbertlateshow @BTS_twt #BTSonLSSC

As journalists it's important to look into the audience & artist that you're writing about. Since you're a site that is politically aware, many of @BTS_twt's songs focus on socio-political topics & they gave a speech at the UN. Their message, just like any music, is universal. pic.twitter.com/5WRVzPq3Ph
do u think young ahl bts ever had the idea that theyd have a sold out stadium tour, attend the grammys, go to the billboards THREE TIMES, perform on gma, have 15+ daesangs, AND give a speech @the un pic.twitter.com/kqO2BUWL8D
Maybe how hard work and perseverance can get someone very far in life. How BTS worked so hard to become the world’s biggest boy band today. Def use the UN speech, Love Yourself, how popular they are in other countries. Maybe add how they are compared to Beatles? Late Show intro!
im pretty sure locals are going to tweet about them later and remember talk to them nicely and tell them about bts and their love yourself campaign n namjoon's un speech
them: you cant dance to bts’ un speech me, an intellectual: pic.twitter.com/Cruaxvj61l
Please ask Bts questions regarding their latest album's concept, their UN speech and their UNICEF LOVE MYSELF CAMPAIGN
A list front and back of BTS songs he should listen to, to read the lyrics and the UN speech, and suggest some really good gg like Mamamoo for example. Now let’s just wait for BTS do their job and snatch his heart and I’ll have someone to talk about BTS at work
No Effin joke I had put Joon’s UN speech, random RUN BTS moments, all the songs and their live stages (or atleast the major ones) up as ads
I love your podcast, it would be interesting if you did one on @BTS_twt. Maybe about their UN speech, songs that involve political topics (Am I Wrong, Silver Spoon, Vote, or Shut Up) or how Mic Drop was inspired by Obama's 2016 WH Correspondents Dinner pic.twitter.com/Jhu9y17HYU
the way this was me last year WAKING UP AT 2AM AEST TO WATCH BTS UN SPEECH (: https://twitter.com/beemyhope_/status/1128568906333945856 …
Please ask BTS about their deep songs,meaning of Album, Persona!!Tell pls RM his mono mixtape surpassed 100 Mill. !! ASK ABOUT UN SPEECH, COMPAIGN!!! AND ASK ANOTHER CYPHER 5!! WE PURPLE YOU THANK YOU!!
#GoodMorningARMY Hi I’m Stephanie I’m Latina & 17 from the US. I found bts last year after watching their UN speech. Their uplifting music & positive messages have impacted my life in so many ways. I’m a better person because of them. I’m proud to call myself an army!
I’m 57yr old mom w an MBA who learned about BTS while watching CNN reporting on BTS speech at UN. It’s been a journey of admiration & devotion ever since. Never n my life have I been this impressed w a grp of ppl/artists. BTS & Army give me renewed hope 4 our future @BTS_twt
Please please please ask BTS their deep message of their Albums,UN compaign, speech! Pls Congrats to RM's mixtape mono!!!!!! DON'T ASK ABOUT COLLAB. BTS AND ARMY ARE SO TIRED,BECAUSE THIS QUESTIONS ASKS EVERY REPORTER!!!!!
Meee! An ARMY who's older than BTS Please ask them smart questions about their Unicef campaign, UN speech, message and lyrics! #BTSonLSSC
please asked them about their UN speech and what's a meaning for "speak yourself"
No problem. Here is a speech they made at UN last year. The content was actually the concept of their music. Hope this would help u to know them better. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
I’m 38 and @BTS_twt makes me feel young and kinda cool too :) They’re amazing role models for today’s youth. If you’re interested in their message, check out their UN speech last year https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
@BTS_twt I have a student who is inspired by you. She showed me your speech at the UN. I’m thankful she has such positive role models to look up to. She’s dying to meet you someday.
We’re not happy about the stupid kakepop segment it’s so ridiculous am sorry do some research before you speak how we as a fandom work how they became famous! Show some professionalism dear!!! What about their music , their UN speech are talking deaf huh
not one thing about the un speech
instead of talking about and lumping bts in with the whole kpop industry, stuff like their messages and social issues in their songs, songs writing and producing, campaigns, or un speech could have been talked about.....
Did being a fansite always have to be from Korean? BTS never taught to bullying someone because she wasn't from Korean. Please to heard carefully when RM's speech at the UN.. And if you're still didn't likes a fansite stop following and cares their behavior. (+)
BTS’s UN Speech Is So Relatable to Confused Millennials https://www.cleo.com.sg/adulting/bts-namjoon-united-nations-speech/#.XNvEP_GyhMo.twitter …
all jokes aside bts, has been acknowledged by the world, and south korea. let’s starts with there international success. kim namjoon, the leader of bts stood in front of people who represented there county, kim namjoon, made a speech in front of the UN, do they not get how + https://twitter.com/btsoutsoldyall/status/1128216492301008896 …pic.twitter.com/Skv5ue81G8
Yeah that's why i said "idc, this boys are doing sth better than u, they went to bbma and even gave speech on un" yeah i am bragging all bts achievement
1. BTS makes great music with great lyrics & message (see:UN speech). 2, they involved heavily in writting n producing. 3, How BTS present their art in various form is amazing (song, dance, mv, story, books, comic, stage etc) 4. They r humble, respectful and love armys deeply.
But thanks to @BTS_twt love yourself series and campaign with the UN and after the AMAZING speech by Namjoon at the UN i started to embrace my personality and flaws and i guess i am doing good till now Hope the uni life and rest of 2019 be better
My Senior Quote from the UN speech that I got inspired @BTS_twt #bts not the best picture ( from last year ) pic.twitter.com/2Z4pIRCiJy
Hold up.... do I smell racism??? Umm lemme tell you something, we’re in a fandom where that “racism shit” AINT ALLOWED. PERIOD. So, if there’s a problem, I suggest you take it up with Namjoon because he didn’t give his UN Speech for nothing! I’m gonna speak myself! pic.twitter.com/prUSCzJJT6
so fellas, i had an oral exam, i talked about bts speech at the UN and took the persona album so my teacher can look through it while i was talking. i did a good job. she became an army #BTS #ARMY @BTS_twt
kim namjoon is the reason i started liking BTS bc his mind and heart surprised me and his UN speech still hunts me to this day. then i find he raps too and i’m like “ok, i stan”.
So today I had a English presentation I had to present forms of power I chose to talk ab music and how it influences so as document I used BTS’ UN SPEECH and Love Yourself albums OMG prof liked it so much I was shaking
My 59-years-old dad doesnt know about that so-called achievements but KNOW about BTS top duo/group bbmas and speech at UN from local newspaper sooo........ https://twitter.com/btsoutsoldyall/status/1128216492301008896 …
y do i wanna waste my energy dwelling on the negative that is "joon having lesser fans/views for his fancam" when it's a bigger deal that he is the spokesperson representing BTS, he delivered a great speech in the UN n that bangtan started with him being the 1st member..
I kid you not every single concept we talked about in class and papers I talked about @BTS_twt. How Namjoon lead the group through diffuse times and UN Speech. I also included all the members with the concepts we discussed and how each member had a significant role+
I would love for them to look into @BTS_twt. They should definitely check out their UN speech & also RM's song, Vote or Just Shut Up. Amazing lyrics yet relevant to today's political environment, with a focus on the importance of voting "Vote is Yours, but the Future is ours" pic.twitter.com/8JddVvVOP5
that’s sweet would be so keen if Stephen Colbert asks BTS about UNICEF and the UN speech, I’m soo looking forward to this appearance the most
BTS First caught my attention: Namjoon (UN Speech) First Bias: Namjoon Current Bias: OT7 (after a week) Bias Wrecker: Tae and Yoongi First MV: Fake Love Fave Song: Mikrokosmos, Magic Shop and 2! 3! Fave MV: BS&T and Spring Day
Does anyone have that gif of Jimin reading namjoon’s UN speech? Cant find it anywhere
While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, BTS has mobilized millions of fans across the world (named ARMY) @bts_bighit @BTS_twt
Oh no! show her BTS UN speech, it might help. goodluck
My favourite thing about Speak Yourself is that after namjoon used it in his UN speech s and locals shit on him for it saying it “wasn’t proper English” and “didn’t make sense what does that even mean” and BTS said fuck you we’ll name our sold out world stadium tour after it pic.twitter.com/ZBYkJFEANI
It's funny how she was one of the few local celebs that were at awe with BTS' UN speech only to do a 180 when they're coming here to presumably take her job away. Don't pretend it's about the fan.
I watched the your speech at the UN again, it's just so powerful.Even if I watch the million times very impressive. I really respect you too much Joon pic.twitter.com/cO5FVThwyK
BTS even draws inspiration from literature http://soompi.com/article/131701 Their UN speech 4 UNICEF campaign http://youtu.be/BF5ZQ1loXVQ made me Army. BTS shouldn’t be defined as simply “Kpop boy band” bec they do it all & meld genres together expertly as evidenced in new album MOS:Persona
I have an international quote from Joon's UN speech on my office door and a BTS desk calendar. Promo promo promo!
My favorite bts moment are when they debuted, won their first daesang, won their first bbmas tsa, un speech, first dome tour, etc. It's so much more but I love everything about them. @FJadaone @inlovewith713
6 yrs after ur tweets will have 1m+ likes and hundred k's rt's. And u guys will be the most famous and successful kpop group in the world having soldout stadium world tour, billboard awards, top charting albums and songs, daesangs, un speech, grammy presentor and nominee + more.
My best friends are ARMYs! Pero naging fan ako when I watched their UN speech and Jimmy Fallon interview.
@strawberjimin THE UN SPEECH ALWAYS
They sell merch, hold exhibitions using bts name. It is supposed to be a lottery system. I ain’t forgetten about the victim union bs and fansites trying to trend a harassment tag on the day of bts un speech. I don’t have a good impression of them.
And BTS literally don’t give a shit about South Korea’s ethics. SK is so close-minded about society and BTS are trying to divide themselves from stereotypes. That’s the whole point to their UN speech and the whole purpose of speaking one’s self
namjoon, thank you so much for being a part of our lives. my heart goes incredibly warm at the thought on how i found you all at the time when i was lost in my path. your music? it pushes us to keep on moving forward. your speech in the un? life changing. take care. i love you
My neighbor is a PhD scholar and she knew how I like a grp called BTS then said she checked them bcz of some video on ig and the thing she said most was that they have lot of views on their MVsand the music is really good, I told her about end voilence campaign and UN speech
I became an army after the UN speech and this was the first pic of BTS I saved :( pic.twitter.com/OGGoyv6bqv
my aunt knows bts (esp tae) because of their un speech aaa i'm so proud
namjoon, thank you so much for being a part of our lives. my heart goes incredibly warm at the thought on how i found you all at the time when i was lost in my path. your music? it pushes us to keep on moving forward. your speech in the un? life changing. take care. i love you
one of my favorite moments of them is their un speech and them saying filipino words @teyungssi
They will.. So far mb luna said she like joon since she saw his speech at UN, n yea thats bts our smart talented and different group
@SeulBearies @BigHit_TXTXBTS my favorite moment is their firts BBMAs and the UN speech
My fav bts moment is when Namjoon made his speech at the UN. He and all of BTS made me so proud that day, and they still do even in this very second. And another smol moment is when they kept smacking each other's butts in that one run BTS ep.
hearing their un speech was definitely one of the greatest moments @najisungy @moonboyjoonpic.twitter.com/sKPWom9mCz
@ggukforkeeps @StigmaKimVTae @beeteasnake my fave bts moment is the UN Speech because I got so proud of all of them and I love how Namjoon expressed their message clearly for all of us to keep in mind. it was a moment to forever be kept.
He got pressed because I share UN speech? My intention is to promote but He thought I said he's r*cist because he doesn't like BTS ahahaha. Why get triggered if he isn't? https://twitter.com/SusyBangtans/status/1127654466663124993 …
i love my mom soo much, the other day she was at work and she was listening to BTS, and her coworker asked her who BTS was and she gave the best answer ever about their lyrics they write and topics they sing about, she also told her coworker to check out Namjoon’s UN speech
This is not even focusing on the fact that he's part of BTS, an entire group of amazing talents with great & worldwide popular music, with positive messages and who gave a speech at the UN recently. I mean seriously.
Every time I hear "Speak For Yourself" instead of "Speak Yourself " I just hear RMs UN speech and want to repeat it.. I wanna know who you are, where you're from..... I wanna hear your conviction..... Speak Yourself...
If BTS and RMs lil UN speech ain’t in any of my exams sis ain’t doing any of her GCSES periodt
RM's amazing & inspiring speech he made at the UN @BTS_twt "I want to hear your voice... No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself.” https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1076405734097600512 …

Fandom needs to rethink their life choices. It’s obvious they don’t give a crap about any of the stuff BTS has been preaching since debut. Speak yourself message, UN speech, human rights, standing up against social issues & injustice...the fandom didn’t get the memo now or what.
I was watching the UN speech again with my mom and she loves it and no I'm definitely not crying it's amazing @BTS_twt
Im the new army maybe new this year,I just listened to Spech RM at the UN.I want to say thank to you for making me aware and opening my eyes that I have to love myself,I cry and want to always repeat the speech.Thank you,now I find the key I'm looking for all this time thanks BTS
i’m tempted to make a speech about namjoon’s UN speech for my english project but i can alrdy see that my classmates will give me the “bts again” look fml
okay but did ya'll see that they used a quote from bts' speech at the UN in produce x 101
I fully expect you to deliver the next UN Speech, Secretary Park
The fact they used a quote from bts' UN speech... pic.twitter.com/J0zYt9X6L7
THEY PUT A PART OF BTS SPEECH IN UN AT PRODUCE X101 TO MOTIVATE YOUNG TRAINEES.... IM NOT CRYING U ARE. OUR BOYS ARE REALLY OUT THERE MOTIVATING YOUNGSTERS TO KEEP DREAMING pic.twitter.com/RC3mO0tLkA
Speak Yourself is BTS's message that's why he asked them about it it's not a Mutual Movement for both of them!! anyway he asked BTS a question about their tour and UN speech he could've posted it alone, but he had to promote his podcast that's why he included them there !
I haven’t replied to ur messages Gurl I’m so sorry I’ve been all over the place BUT I HOPE UR STEP DAD DOES GREAT!!!!! BTS went to UN and did a speech and look at him now also doing amazing things!!! Great minds think alike!
I dont think I've ever seen a post more accurately describing Namjoon's huge influence and his amazing ability to speak so well. His eloquence is half the reason why so many ppl who dont know bts pay attention to them. Just look at the UN speech or even his bbmas speeches
My non- kpop friends have respect for BTS because of that UN speech. Like who on earth that doesn't love such a smart and delicate man.
Uhhh no,,that happened september 2018. The days before BTS' speech at UN. They even tried to ruin that day by trying to trend a tag about it when there was clearly no evidence.
respect for @LunaMaya26 that always promoting our boys to her friends. she's not only talking about visual but explain about BTS's (especially RM) talents, achievements, UN speech too. wishing more people will recognize BTS not only as an idol group but inspirational group pic.twitter.com/4z6bTFIPr5
I was always afraid to get on stage and speak, but Namjoons UN speech inspired me and I did 2 anchoring for my department programmes. When my friends asked me to do it, I was afraid.But thinking back to 'Speak Yourself' encouraged me to do it. Thank you @BTS_twt for that
Trevor noah can you interview namjoon and ask him about the UN speech or the end violence campaign. Can you please talk about BTS ' messages through music. Aaaaaaaaa aa Trevor noah is such a great interviewer tbh
His UN speech made me fall for BTS harder. Stan a group that spreads positivity and self love and share those values to your fellow fans! https://twitter.com/moonrainksj/status/1127195895999619072 …
was watching Produce X 101 and they mentioned @BTS_twt ‘s speech at the UN :’)) pic.twitter.com/qYB1seC0wB
It was after RM gave a speech at UN last year that i started to look for their music videos. Then this year i spent a lot buying BTS merchandise and my FB and IG look like a fan page. At my age of 36 it’s kinda embarrasing but I love the boys. Now i can distinguish whose singing
Thank u Namjoon for being an inspiration, u encourage me, u motivate me. Thank u for always helping me, Idk how many times i've listened to ur #UN speech. Thank u for being real,for not having a mask. Thank u for being urself. #RM my leader #Loveyourself @BTS_twt
I showed Namjoon's UN speech to my mom and she was so impressed! Like his speech can be so deep and sincere that it touches your heart. It's so empowering. He has a clear vision of what he stands for as a person and as a member of BTS. He has a gifted voice. So much respect
Omg yesterday my friend said that she can't understand why I like bts so much anf I recomended video un speech namjoon. Finally she realize why I like bts and support them. You know what, if all people are open minded they will like bts
Can we give view @BTS_twt speech at UN GA. It's only 1M yeorobun, show your support #MTVLAINSTAGLJUNGKOOK #MTVLAKPOPBTShttps://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Bts choose their own collabs at the end of the day so all youre mad about is that army aint supporting and giving your faves clout. The same ones whose kfans make fun of hobi all the time and the international fans dragged joon's UN speech.
They make music for all ages, are writing beautiful lyrics and producing too, have the sweetest personalities and adress social problems and spread just love. They give back too f.e. with their Unicef campaign. Part of their inspiring UN speech: https://twitter.com/moonveloutae/status/1061724261092679680/video/1 …
Yup This is the World Biggest Boy Band Who Won 2 Billboard Awards this year, Went to Grammy’s and Gave Speech on UN assembly @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/hNjBlWmH5v
i became an army nov 2018, i saw namjoon's speech in un, i was really inspired by that and then after that started to listen to their songs
They are just so HUMAN One day they are giving an UN speech the next day they are doing the slap the pony fortnite dance at Jimmy Fallon
(Quietly sobbing in Korean) 으흐흑......... when my dad Kakaotalked me after the UN speech I felt like we bonded on a deeper level for the first time in 40 years!!!!! Aw so happy for you and your parents!!!!! This makes me so happy.
BTS best selling korean album, princes of pop, top duo/group, #8 billboard hot 100, 2 songs on hot100, grammy nominee, un speech and list goes on. That's it. That's the tweet. #BTSBestSellingKoreanAlbum @BTS_twt
You might want to check out their UN speech. It's not kpop stuff but it's something positive. It might brighten your day. We PURPLE you.
last year they made a whole hashtag complaining and accusing security of sexual harassment for doing their jobs in the us and canadian venues. on a important day for bts (the un speech) they always do this when they are in the us it’s a pattern and i don’t like it
It's @BTS_twt twitter actually rather than 'kpop'. They write/produce diverse music that tends to be socially driven, like mental health, self love, dreams, societal pressures, etc. They also gave a speech at the UN, were on TIME, performed on SNL, etc. pic.twitter.com/Jhu9y17HYU
calling us having low iq when bts has preach so much about the flaw in societys system, the education, self love, and even had a speech at the un about violence against children and so much more, talk again when you actually have a good comeback https://twitter.com/isshaddanial/status/1126700321554571264 …
seeing people hyping each other up about beating no pants girl, attacking fansites and just being disgusting in general.. this goes against everything BTS stands for,, yall need to listen to joon's UN speech more
I don't even care about these little pages anymore cause our boys here achieving so much more . Blonks can rant all they want ,they don't have a billboard award for top group we do . Their faves didn't present awards in Grammys BTS did , their faves didn't give a speech in UN .
My mom’s watching bts videos on youtube and even saw their UN speech— she was really impressed
so today we had to write an essay of an unforgettable moment in your life and I wrote about going to a bts concert and I was so happy writing it and I got carried away and suddenly wrote joons speech at the un and now idk what am I supposed to do with my essay (your fault joon)
Before UN speech
Joon has such a BEAUTIFUL mind & soul. Have u come across his post yet frm 2015? He was only 20, abt 2b 21, a full 3 yrs b4 his UN speech & 2yrs b4 the LY Series. Thoughts had clearly been brewing. He loves& wanted 2b a poet. This is a trans but hopefully captures the essence. pic.twitter.com/i2SI77Ykrz
“I have many faults, and I have many more fears, but I’m going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself gradually, just little by little.” - RM’s UN Speech, 2018 (3) Thank you @BTS_twt #fear #loveyourself #speakyourself #방탄소년단
so im mentioning namjoon's un speech in my english cba and im terrified cause only two people in my class dont hate bts :/
"I have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was and for who I hope to become." — Kim Nam Joon; @UN General Assembly Speech (2018. 09. 24) #BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt
What happened to #endviolence you do know sending death threats to other people is basically you threatening to harm that person. This is embarrassing. Some of them are going against what bts stand for. The whole un speech happened. Did y’all forget already?
I'm nervous to include him because my school is quite judgemental and I don't want people to think I'm including him because I'm a fan of BTS, when in reality I would be including him for his UN speech about Speaking Yourself and the youth campaign they've made.
they quoted BTS speech from UN.
Inspirational speech at UN
Fansites are good at lying. They also lied before. Remember during the time BTS was about to give a speech at UN? They were trying to trend a tag to call out bh when fansites actually lied about being racially profiled. The truth was they were thrown out bec they broke rules
you should plan early,tell early enough,show them BTS deep songs, UN speech of RM, BTS donating from their every concert earning to UN compagn!! BTS did charity from their debut year,They donated to clinic, education, cancer research center,school etc. Talk about positive things
But do you remember what happened during the Hamilton concert? The security was tight and fansites went crazy, accusing guards of racism and sexual harassment. Trying to trend a terrible #the day BTS was giving the UN speech...
I sleep at almost 2 am last night because Papa and I watch BTS’s solo stages performance and we also watch namjoon’s speech at UN and Papa was like “ohhh they’re so good in dancing and singing” and i was like “ofcourse and they’re also humble and the sweetest guy i met”.
WAS HE INSPIRED BY BTS AT UN SPEECH? NO I AM GONNA GO AND UGLY CRY
i have a fcking philosophy essay to do in 20 day about human rights to present to my class and i think im gonna mention bts and their un speech, my class needs to know what is good @BTS_twt
lol i actually forgot that the second/third(??idek) time they made a fuss against bighit cracking down on them was literally the day of the UN speech. they don't give a shit about BTS, they just want to make money
YESS UN SPEECH
write bout his UN speech that is my inspiration
Thank you mam, such an honor to have a shout out from a legend. If you aren't familiar with @BTS_twt. Their UN speech for UNICEF is a great intro to them and their message pic.twitter.com/Jhu9y17HYU
Namjoon’s lyricism and poetic nature doesn’t just extend to Persona- the beautiful speech he wrote and delivered at the UN General Assembly inspired the current world tour’s name and theme #RKiveParty #RM @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/0pQnB7iaw6
i know bp didn't appear on ellen or win at a major awards show or give a un speech, they're not as big as bts is. but it's upsetting how they've had RARELY any media coverage in korea when they perfomed at one of the biggest music festivals
++ she said: “Im just a hater” jokingly and I told her to remove the prejudice and check out their music. And she actually srsly said that she will. I told her to give them a chance. Guess who’s planning to educate her more on our boys next week (UN speech etc) #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/OYGDQN19jg
Right? I was speechless when he said that after seeing one clip of Joon during the UN speech. I'm trying to get him to stan BTS as a whole and not only Namjoon but I'm taking baby steps rn
IS THIS THE SAME GUY WHO GAVE INSPIRATIONAL SPEECH AT UN ?! @BTS_twt #NAMJOONpic.twitter.com/894ofYy62m
Shut up because I love the wistful, chill, vibe and your voice is soothing so at least gimme a soundcloud download or something. And What would BTS say to you if they heard you talking negative about yourself like this? Joon would have an entire UN speech ready. You're TALENTED.
they added bts’ speech at the UN :( pic.twitter.com/mWj3snTEsf
I found BTS through the UN speech and curiosity turned to wanting to know everything about them which brought me to the vlive app. Oct.5 Tae did a live and something about the way he spoke just tugged at my heart and I haven’t stopped supporting him since.
Thank you sir, I also noticed you're an activist. @BTS_twt is a great group to look into, they talk a lot about social topics in their music/speeches (mental health, self love, dreams, societal pressures on youth, etc.). Here is also their UN speech https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
Lol yes!!! Show her the UN speech. She will be done for.
I'm glad there're teachers like u that can give a voice to BTS so others can get to know them it was really touching that u also wanted them to see the lyrics, the artistry in the mv, the live performance, Joon's UN speech and even research a bit about them +honest opinion ty
Rm’s UN speech ?
there there generalizing again.with all due respect bts fanbase comes with diverse age range. im 25 y/o working adult n i bcome their fan from watching their UN speech last year not bcs of looks.but whatever we say u will only kept saying 'that trash band'.so im out and good day!
Remember back in September when there were those 2 full weeks of just really really important promo including the UN speech, incredibily eventful. Ever since the BBMAs (and ongoing) feels the same way...and it's probably gonna last longer this time. @BTS_twt
from un speech bangtan bomb?
I wonder how I end up liking BTS so hard bcs it's kinda not always my type of music? Maybe bcs I fell in love w/ their UN speech so I drowned as a whole concept—the idea & spirit That's when I knew that it's wrong talking about BTS only about how they sound & k-pop prejudice.
I couldn’t agree moreThey r certainly a blessing 2 come into my Baby Boomer life. I never ever expected to be this inspired by 7 young men from SK who speak a diff language than me. But I’ve been blown away by all aspects of this amazing grp since RM’s UN speech @BTS_twt
#BTS and Korean supporters insult Japanese victims of #atmicbomb in #Hiroshima and #Nagasaki. They repeatedly do hate speech to Japanese people. Do you want to be the side of such people ? pic.twitter.com/JuCqwmWG9f
so it’s been 7months since bts speech at UN but it feels like yesterday?????
"Family that become closer through BTS." "I would never watch UN speech at dawn." "I would nvr know BB Hot 100 chart release on Tuesday."

Who is the guy there? is a RM whose speech at the UN?Is Jin is a handsome worlwide?is a SUGA a music lover?Is JHOPE our hope?Is JM our pride?Are V and JK the two maknaes who are very handsome? #MTVLAKPOPBTS #MTVLAFANDOMBTSARMY #MTVLAINSTAGLJUNGKOOK #PremiosMTVMIAW @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/5J6XRoSIoJ
it’d include iconic moments like the UN speech where namjoon was inclusive to all genders and sexual orientations, how bts do their best to write gender-neutral lyrics; as well as how armys have faced discrimination related to their lgbt identities
this korean guy came into my cube and saw my suga keychain from LY tour and he was like guy: you like bts? guy to his new hire: bts is a boyband THOROUGHLY EMBARRASSED but ofc he got baited by my namjoon quotes on my wall uwu. i told him to check out their UN speech.
I can easily understand that you didn’t even tried to understand them. Just watch some lyric videos, their UN speech or Music Prof’s reactions to them. Use your internet for something right
An excerpt from the speech of Namjoon in UN was used in ProduceX101 @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/hj0h768y9i

His UN speech was incredible ntm the fact that he writes and produces all of their songs and his own if I’m not mistaken. Mans is incredibly talented him for sure and bts are stan worthy
You should listen to the whole albums, not just the songs that get a music video. And, of course, watch Run BTS, learn about their backgrounds, listen to RM's UN speech, etc.
Guys I just finished the outline for the speech I have to give on either Tuesday or Friday and it’s about how loving yourself is important and I included two quotes by #KimNamjoon he said at the UN, let me know if it’s good and wish me luck please! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/S6MSXGIprE
Sending you strength for today's concert, the SY series remind me of your UN speech I can't recover from it's so cool, have fun tonight RM and you were so cute splashing the water bottle everywhere, you looked so happy and cute yesterday i love u
So i started to find more about bangtan. Then i watched BTS speech in UN. I cried. Not because the bts made it to the UN but it was because the speech hit me right there in the wound
Make sure malaysian artist give speech at UN, win billboard music award, sell out 90K seats at stadium and then you can talk bad about BTS. But wait a sec bcs i am gonna report u first

THE QUOTED BTS UN SPEECH AT PRODUCE X 101 SJDJDN
Not Today was the first video I checked out after hearing RM’s speech & seeing them at the UN. Since then, I’ve never looked back. It will be very special for me to see them perform it live. God- & UK-embassy willing, I will in 4 wks time. Congrats @BTS_twt & RoseBowl Armys!
one of trainee in producex101 used bts’s speech in UN
"There were moments i wanted to give up. But i was lucky enough to not give up" Mnet really put this line of bts' messages from their UN speech on the reality show 'produce x 101' pic.twitter.com/t6wIJYShw0
This reminds of when this lady passed by LINE after their GMA appearance & she asked me what the crowd was for. I told her about @BTS_twt & the first thing I thought to tell her was about Namjoon’s UN speech. She thought their message was great. I almost teared up at the support. https://twitter.com/bhxcyphers/status/1124555784682070016 …
BUT WHY IS EVERYONE'S HAIR IN BTS GOING DARK AGAIN? ARE THEY GOING SOMEWHERE OR DOING SOMETHING LIKE A SPEECH AT THE UN AGAIN? coz that's the last time I remember them doing neutral hair colors
He shuffles around tbh, but his speech at the UN is the whole reason I started to learn more about BTS rather than just casually listen so he will always have a special place in my heart
It's for their concert at the Rose Bowl. If you're interested in knowing more about them, this video is a great summary of their journey & who they are. Their UN speech is also great to watch @BTS_twt. Nobodies to Legends: https://youtu.be/8XxYHkGM_lA pic.twitter.com/Jhu9y17HYU
Joon’s words never fail to touch ppls heart and that’s probably why his UN speech kinda changed the world @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xgaaqsx6tY
lol if they stuck to standards or the rules or what they are SUPPOSED to do. They wouldn't have been Bangtan. They wouldn't have gone to the UN and given a fucking speech. They wouldn't have had the special bond that BTS and ARMYs have. They wouldn't have had 2 movies.
"There were moments I want to give up, but i was lucky enough to not give up." There's this line of @BTS_twt UN speech at Produce X 101 which represent how much trainees desperate to be an idol. I sincerely wish you all the best and luck for your dream! pic.twitter.com/c3M42to0o0
And before you ask about my face mask. I have cancer and am going through chemo. So I was protecting myself. I told the reporter to go watch the UN speech. Really talk to the ARMYs that have been impacted. I even quizzed him on the members names so he’d know who was who.
When I was in line it was a lot of parents with younger fans who weren’t going to the shows. It was the editing. But I told the reporter, go watch the UN speech, look at the charity works and money raised. This was a diverse and fully engaged fandom. All supporting BTS. Cont.
caveat that most in my social circle know about bts because of how often they appear on forbes and other business-related news. i cant forget how their UN speech also ignited a discussion between my old friends from law school, who know nothing about kpop.
omg they quoted bts' un speech pic.twitter.com/7TcT7tBl0A
good morning today my roommate is making me join his final project which is a podcast abt bts' un speech LMAOOO LETS GET THIS BREAD ADORABLE REPRESENTATIVES
Like wtf? BTS have been supportive of LGBTQ rights since before their debut! Joon literally mentioned gender identity in his UN speech which is different from gender. They just worked with an openly bisexual artist and want to collaborate with more lgbtq artists in the future.
the way he put bts un speech as his motivation quote, im- https://twitter.com/mnet_produce101/status/1124354008796151808 …
i'm watching prpoduce x and there have been three bts auditions so far,,, and mnet used namjoon's un speech as a quote ajskhfes
I know! Huhuhu. Namjoon made me cry noon while watching his speech before the UN. I’m a proud ARMY
Saying your speech you gave at UN for my final performance in drama class!! Love you joon!
It speak alot about demographic and range kind of their fans. Even intellectuals stan BTS! And RM amazing and eloquent speech at UN just cemented their status as they no longer can be considered as fad but serious force in music industry and even world peace!
Getting invitation in giving speech at UN totally show BTS in another level right now and it show that they are not typical boyband. I mean its freaking UN! Plus, even at UN, there are tons of people there actually BTS fans as i saw so many waiting to take picture with them. ++
So an ARMY that’s was on my flight ended up in the same shuttle with me and we are telling this guy all about @BTS_twt and their message and UN speech and all that. He’s hooked
Thank You for this article. I like that @BTS_twt UN Speech was given a highlight. Also, 42 yr old Mom like me is an awe of guys who uses their medium to uplift spirits; their music speaks to me and everyone else, crashing borders of language, age, gender, race and religion.
I knew about kpop bc of 2NE1, but it was off my radar until like, 2017. Even then, armys also scared me & YT armys can be embarrassing in comments so I avoided bts. I’d see bts a lot on social media, but I avoided it until I saw joon’s un speech & a hobi baepsae fancam akdkoskwj
Unfortunately, I have no idea haha, but this is definitely a part of their un speech, so we know the overall content right? maybe @BTS_Trans could you help us please?
@BTS_twt just want to let u guys know, specially RM, that u inspire me to study hard in my law school and don't give up. There was a time I almost drop out cause of frustration but ur UN speech and songs gave me a boost on why I chose this career. Thank u! #RM
Produce X Ep.1. BTS UN Speech Sometime, I just wanted to quit. "I think I was very lucky that I didn't give it all up." @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/q9vYdunPYp
Thank you @7evenUnited for showing the UN speech clip here!
Yes same! I hope Stephen @StephenAtHome watches this clip that you shared here of RM giving the UN speech The speech is so inspirational & the fact that RM self-taught himself English & spoke so eloquently in a language thats not his native one, makes it that much more amazing
Okay, I have to add. One of the older ladies at work stopped me today to tell me she "saw those boys I like" on TV. Then she asked my favorite song... I gave her the UN speech and told her there is no favorite. All of there songs are good, so start with IDOL and have fun.
Both. They always have amazing perfs & I'm interested to see what interview questions @StephenAtHome will ask. He's an amazing interviewer, & I'm hoping for questions related to their artistic work, like their UN speech, stadium tour, US achievements, etc. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
It changed mine for sure, i already knew about BTS for years because of my army mom but never gave them a serious look, not before the UN speech, i said hmm they must be something else to be invited for that, and here i am being completely swept by them.
I'm speechless. I literally dreamt about this, especially after the UN speech last year. Stephen is a great interviewer, so I can't wait for this!!
[idm] a quote from rm’s speech at the un :) I’m so proud! I’m happy BTS are inspiring pic.twitter.com/AM1WfvtdRs
I'm nervous but always thinking about u namjoonie, bc I feel like u have been through this and u did it so well!!! I was thinking about your speech in the UN and how inspiring that was, I hope someday I could do something big like that, but today I'll try to do my best @BTS_twt

Thank you for giving them a chance.. You should check out their UN speech (given by the leader because he is fluent in english) Sorry, cause i don't have a link to that.
PRODUCE X 101 USED A QUOTE FROM BTS’S UN SPEECH?
Even though Korea is typically a culturally conservative country, BTS seems to be more progressive in terms of social issues. In their UN speech I think that was clear. However, they definitely could be pretty damn conservative on other things. pic.twitter.com/p2itrpgJAM
sad. you obviously didn’t understand. you’re an adult AND an army body shaming someone after bts literally dropped 3 albums and a UN speech about loving yourself for who you are. https://twitter.com/Dessnician/status/1124333045820088320 …
How am I just Now falling in LOVE with #BTS I remember the buzz when they started, AMA performance, their UN speech, hearing they’re amazing performers... I’m just now listening to their music! #obsessed @bts_bighit
So good that they mentioned the LY message and the UN speech
not exactly an action by bts but holland, the only openly gay korean idol, talking about bts’ un speech pic.twitter.com/90MYExikyt
Yes I will. Maybe not a good career for a protective mum but I will always want him to do what makes him happy. Like Namjoon said about finding something you are passionate about in his UN speech. That's really important in life.
Kpop artists wear a rainbow shirt chosen by their stylist qnd for y’all they’re lgbtq icons but when BTS openly support them even in their UN speech its irrelevant and embarrassing... ok pic.twitter.com/8TbOgSBSo2
i wasn’t a fan until i saw their UN speech. I was so touched by the influence they tried to spread. I mean these 7 boys make millions of people scream YOU CAN’T STOP ME LOVING MYSELF And i believe that’s the kind of influence we all need. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/uljM4Bvmni
I respect β0¥ opinion but based on concert attendance, sales, chart, bts is bigger and more popular in the us and western, they attended grammy, invited to give speech in the UN, and invited to 6 big tv shows. I'm not salty or sombong or sumn but i'm just giving infos that i know
A lot more seriously than the other shows BTS has been on. His audience are more mature & I expect a great interview from him talking abt the UN speech, Love Myself campaign etc. This appearance is probably aimed to change the whole average boyband view that ppl still have on BTS
I don’t expect those antis to know all of that but did they forget the UN speech ? Or even how most bts songs are gender neutral ?
This... is surprisingly good. A good primer for muggles. Important topics and messages covered by their songs Stage presence and showmanship UN speech, Grammys, BWL YT record, SNL Early demand since 2014, showing how organic their growth is @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/AureliaOT7/status/1124228289608896512 …
I just finished my oral about bts in Dutch and it went so well my teacher was like wow when we showed her joon's speech at the UN I'm so proud eksksj
I'm just kidding.. Show them what BTS been doing. Like the UN speech, Suga's annual donations on his bdays.. Etc...
a local asked me who bts was i sent them RM's UN speech they responded with two words "wow RM "
Stephen, I’m so happy youre inviting them on! I’ve watched you since way back during the daily show! i hope youd squeeze a little interview in & ask about their unicef campagins amd UN speech dont mind if you mention the “B” band either Lastly, the correct tag is @BTS_twt!
he is da reason why i look up to bts his un speech was what made me a fan
Not at BTS in total winning 4 awards at BBMAs, soldout US and UK stadium, killing all charts, crashing Melon app, crashing youtube, went to Grammys, got Cultural Merit, giving a speech at UN. Ugh MY ARMY EGO pic.twitter.com/3bgGjPJDeO
omg we're having our yearbook ehi watch me use namjoon's un speech or bts' lyrics jhskwjwldeodie im so excited idk what to put
i have been fan of halsey since closer era back in 2016 and just become bts fan last year after watching their un speech. watching my biggest favs performed together on the very same stage was so amazing pic.twitter.com/yA2Rd8Z5V6
Weren't kpop stans saying that "they were making money profiting off depression" and sh*t like that when they wrote sad songs? Same with the UN speech
Last year bts released- 2 mixtapes 2 Korean albums 2 Japanese albums Multiple covers & solo songs by vocalists World tour UN speech Perf @korea-france summit. Bt yeah, they're overrated cuz they're men. Ur girls r underrated with their flaying ur hands dancing & no musical input
• day 122 i did a presentation about self acceptance all inspired by you and showed your un speech as well. it turned out great, i'm satisfied :) but i am dead tired because i haven't slept in 33 hours.. i hope you'll all rest well. i'm proud of you, please take care ! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/2WTj6noIbn
A well-researched article that brings up @BTS_twt's origins, lyrics, what makes their music unique, achievements (as well as their UNICEF work and UN speech), as well as how ARMY defies stereotypes. Boost! https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1123927140330889217 …
My Boss: " I know you like BTS, I saw their UN speech. You must look up to them in terms of working hard and overcome all the challenges to attain success." I was literally thinking, fxck off bitch, BTS tell me to love myself and speak out when it is necessary...
so i did a seminar abour self acceptance in which i included loving, facing, speaking and finding yourself and bts' speech at the UN uwu
we were supposed to write a biography about someone who impacted our generation for english (my teacher is v close-minded) and i talked about bts, the un speech, the grammys, their political messages, billboard and the stadium tour while mostly having songs in korean pic.twitter.com/qSfhOhchGm
Issues like assault and toxic gender norms apply to both men AND women and I KNOW BTS did not make that speech at the UN just for women, it was for everyone.
@BTS_twt WAS JUST 5YRS OLD WHEN THEY –BROKE YT RECORDS –GOT ALL-KILL –TOPPED UK CHART –TOPPED BB200 3X SINCE THE BEATLES –GAVE SPEECH AT UN –PRESENTED AN AWARD AT GRAMMYS –WON TOTAL OF 24 DAESANG –WON TOTAL OF 4 AWARDS AT THE BBMAS How about you? What do you do successfully?
Aww BT21 wants to give a speech to the universe like how BTS spoke at the UN. It's even koya who'll be giving the speech! *he's also as clumsy as his dad hehe* pic.twitter.com/HqH5osUhHs
BTS went from dreaming of becoming big in korea to topping the billboard chart, getting invited to grammy museum, giving a speech at the UN, being featured on time magazine's most influential list, present an award at the grammys and sell out US stadiums. They've come so far pic.twitter.com/qUNOCjpCUB
Wow, thank u for linking the vid to @BTS_twt' UN Speech
Jungkook really said at first BT21 fails and Yoongi says OK, they give a speech to the universe like us at the UN Taehyung: let's not say they failed, let's say they didn't do well on the first try. I'm with HOSEOK: "Isn't this too us?" #BT21_UNIVERSE #BT21 @BTS_twt @BT21_
Me casually watching BTS video. My sister : Where is that? Me : UN, they gave a speech My sister : THEY WENT TO UN AND GIVE A SPEECH? AND THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING AT THEM Me: uhmmm, yes My sister : What is wrong with our country
It’s truly the same feeling as their first daesang and their UN speech, just so damn proud my heart feels like it’s going to burst @BTS_twt I am so so so proud of you, you can’t ever understand. We are with you all the way, whatever dream you have is also our dream. #BTSTopGroup
@gowithdennis https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg Dennis, I know you’re already pretty proud of BTS and all they’ve done so far, but do yourself a favor and watch their (well, Namjoon’s) speech delivered to the UN. It’s truly remarkable and may make you shed a tear!
this is the same man who gave a speech at the UN and wrote so many of bts’ greatest hits pic.twitter.com/6yVhJOQmy4
Well, I managed to recruit a new ARMY during 5th period today! While I was helping him with his presentation, he told me about how much he liked Namjoon's speech at the UN and that it really gave him a lot of respect for BTS.

24th September 2018 - the UN speech I had been twitter lurking for ages by now & knew everything that was happening, but Joon's speech was what inspired me to FINALLY open this account to help spread the word, celebrate BTS 's accomplishments & make friends. #BBMAsTopSocial
also wait wait wait. telling ppl to be silent abt their hatred for c,rdi bc shes directly offended lgbt + poc folk is the exact OPPOSITE of what speak yourself n joon's un speech is all about. the way bts would be disappointed in this lol https://twitter.com/kthmixtaepe/status/1123416152212828160 …
it's from when they went to the UN for the speech ( #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt) https://youtu.be/5qi9_lKCXUQ
BTS are at a different level as compared to last year. The boys have achieved so much between this year and last year's BBMAs - 3 BB200 albums, a Grammy nominated album + appearance, a sold-out Citifield concert, SNL, their UN speech...to name a few #BBMAsTopSocial

How BTS inspire me: Tbh they inspire me in so many parts of life. In studies,I remember the lines from Pied Piper and NMD. In life, I remember Namjoon's speech at UN assembly. Whenever i feel sad or depressed,i listen to their music #MYArmyWithLuv #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
Our brilliant multitalented leader RM. The foundation on which BTS was built. Your inspirational UN speech is what started this mom on the wonderful journey of the BU. TY 4 being all you can be & showing the unappreciated potential of our youth #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
So now I urge you to speak yourself.. Namjoon UN Speech #MYArmyWithLuv #BBMAsTopSociaI BTS
UN speech and MAMA 2018 speech it has to be. These moments give me goosebumps every single time and just make me feel hella proud and grateful of them for continuing and never giving up even if they thought that this might be a dead end. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt

Not an army but speech RM of BTS gave at UN is so inspiring..
This. Gue juga bukan fans BTS tapi that time, bener-bener, indescribable banget ngeliat mereka gave a speech di UN. Lol everyone even non-kpop stan gotta see that. https://twitter.com/avakoreaiscool/status/1123225464531587077 …
But i can't believe a year passed since @BTS_twt 's first performance at the BBMAs 2018, time really flies and look at them now back with even more success, a UN speech, historical records, and a world stadium tour, i am so proud of them. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS pic.twitter.com/smhVVJ2poC
This mfs talking bout bts had a speech on the UN with English and they proud? 2 point: 1st. If they proud because their idol pop up on the UN then i salute them too. 2nd. They can speak english. Nigga i aint korean i fking can . . . UN wasnt my best friend tho, summ know y.
long story short: met one of them @an event. topic was what we‘d change in the radio. colleague said he all know what Sarah would change and said „play more BTS“. „who?“ *me naming all their success including billboard, un speech etc.* they got interested and listend to bwl
#BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt there’s so much bts moments to remember but i have to choose when they launched the love myself campaign + joon’s un speech. everybody was moved with their campaign especially when joon gave a speech + pic.twitter.com/lrmvbY9gEy
His speech, "use me, use us to love yourself" & his UN Speech "yesterday me is still me, tomorrow i might be a bit wiser, and for who i hope to become" intro:persona gave me that feeling! [ #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt]
Well BTS was giving speech infront of the UN, but this moron? Nothing.. jelousy is a sin bro! Hell yeah!
Absolutely no one asked but I watched the UN speech so here we are talking about how bts came into my life and how I became the crazy fangirl I am today.
About your friend who looks down on BTS, tell them: talk to me again after you give your speech at UN. Oops, that sounds so impossible though. So, yeah. Keep talking. Thank you for sharing your story too, dear! Let's unite to spread the awareness ♡

Namjoon's UN speech and when I first read the lyrics to their song "Moving on".
I remember them giving the speech at the UN and that was the moment i realized i should make a stan Twitter bc i could not shut up about them #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
How many artists do so much good to others? To that extend? W/ such good intentions & sincerity? Bts saved lives (ppl who were suicidal), help those w/ depression, insecurities etc w/ their healing music & messages. Gave a speech in UN General Assembly. Yall out here being .
I like the sweaters and some shirts, especially the one with Joon's speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/1nRfTS91kX

Today I had my english mock exam and one of the questions was "How role-model or celebrities can make a cause more visible" and I managed to set @BTS_twt as an example with their Love Yourself Campaign and with their speech in @UN General Assembly.
First time I watched Born Singer. Also, watching the UN speech. I remember sobbing inside the uber on my way to work.
Hands down first daesang, UN speech, jin’s almost disband speech #BBMAsTopSocial BTS

Joon’s UN speech #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
Me, yelling at Frontrunner students how BTS already did the UN speech
We tried to spread more BTS positive attitude, lyrics and their UN speech, but if ppl refuse to read, we can’t do anything. I don’t mind ppl hate on my fandom, but if they hate BTS for their race and looks, that’s not even about BTS anymore. It’s about toxic attitude.
I saw this dream with @BTS_twt and they were having a concert in my school and me and jungkook went to somewhere else and talked for a long time he then said Namjoon UN speech (no matter who you are...) and my dream was over if you want more details, tweet me

The UN speech was amazing, do they have any plan with UNICEF this year or future?
Actually BtS is pretty popular in South America as well. And I would say that they have an impact since they are Asians being represented in media. I’ve seen many Asian families on twitter feel proud that bts came to America, preformed, gave a speech at the UN, etc

Wondering if you can ask them about their message "Speak Yourself" as it was their theme for their amazing UN speech. In addition it is their theme for their Stadium Tour. In times of societal division and conflict, their messages about acceptance and love is important

just because it didn’t inspire you doesn’t mean it didn’t help other people. you can’t use the UN speech for clout to brag about bts and their accomplishments, then turn around and accuse it (and namjoon) of being manufactured purely for profit. like... it just don’t add up.
The UN speech is one thing that makes BTS proud, REALLY proud, every time when the members enumerate their achievements they ALWAYS talk bout the UN speech cuz they're proud to be a part of an important movement. That's why the UN speech belongs to the BTS merch #BBMAsTopSocialhttps://twitter.com/uhgoodsoul/status/1122786523529777152 …
i'm curious too why people think RM alone wrote his UN speech without any relation to the brand their company is pushing,,,,i mean its BTSxUN not RMxUN
NO He doesn't know he said back days, He think he is not famous one among members That is why i always told ARMYs support rapline, Show Namjoon LOVE He doesn't know, I think he is still underrated exept usa, brazil.He got attention after UN speech #BBMAsTopSocial BTS #BTS_twt

Lmao that annoying woman go on private huh. Why? Didnt you should preach your fans and malaysian that bts is a fckin illuminati and done nothing even after the un speech? You should keep preaching and tell the world that bts gonna bring negativity cause
Why most people view BTS as an entertainment only ? Does the UN speech means nothing to yall ? They did not spend hundreds of hours incorporating important messages into their music, talking about mental health and self love for it to be thrown aside @BTS_twt

We saw BTS for the first time in NJ on 9/28/18. It was just days after Namjoon gave his speech at the UN. That night at the concert, Joon started talking about it and I lost it. I cried my eyes out, like a mom over their child's accomplishments and growth. Rosalie looked (+)
Have her watch NamJoon’s UN Speech And then show her the Not Today and Let me know videos ... they won me over. :) pure talent and an awesome message. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt

when joon said in his un speech about how his past makes up a part of his own beautiful constellation, hoseok said he wouldnt go back in time to tell himself to change anything and bts as a whole accepted their past & was moved by the effort theyve put in....that hurts
Agree. A true artist shall respect other artist. But not in this case. The so called veteran artists in my country downgrading bts achievements. From saying UN speech is nothing to be proud of to making xenophobic remarks. And its upsetting.

“They’re shallow and fake,” journalists say, not realizing that one of my friend stopped being suicidal after listening to “The Last” and my trans friend broke down in tears when BTS included “gender identity” in their UN speech.
idk since we dont really talk sksks maybe he saw joons un speech and finally realized bts are worth stanning
#BBMAsTopSocial @BTS_twt How is it? I said I miss you guys so much I had memorized RM's UN speech, I love a part of that speech: Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me. Today I am how I am with all of my faults and mistakes.…………I can't type anymore. pic.twitter.com/CuV5aQxhtr
Oh and BTS just released an entire album dedicated to us. They even said in their UN speech we’re the best fans in the world. They’re proud of us and the millions we’ve raised for charity, but I doubt they’d be impressed by you. Have a nice day
He is caring and sincere. He gave a very touching speech at UN which drew global attention. Many schools in Asia took his speech as teaching material in English lesson. [ #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt ]
That is true You Guys can watch Behind the scene UN Speech video Yoongi said that BTS fans or kpop fans belittled for being fans #BBMAsTopSocial BTS #BTS_twt
the fact bts is an ambassador of unicef, contribute 3% of their LY album sales for their #ENDViolence campaign, invited by the UN to present a speech literally bc of their positive influence to youth but it's so easy to dismiss this since they're well, bts. aren't u embarassed?
Full offense to all these local artists/celebs that speak as if they're way more relevant than BTS to attract foreign fans and way more impactful by belittling BTS UN speech as "nothing to be proud of" while they can't even breathe near any of BTS' success #BBMAsTopSocial BTS

Thirteen Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Twelve So, let’s all take one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to “speak yourself.” I would like to ask all of you. What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Eleven These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Ten Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’s me, too. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Nine If there’s anything that I’ve achieved, it was only possible because I had my other BTS members by my side, and because of the love and support of our ARMY fans. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Eight I’m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling. We have become artists performing in huge stadiums and selling millions of albums. But I am still an ordinary, twenty-four-year-old guy. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Seven Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were hurdles. Most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes, I just wanted to quit. I think I was very lucky that I didn’t give it all up. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Six I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice in me that said, ‘Wake up, man, and listen to yourself!” But it took me a long time to hear music calling my name. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Five Soon, I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Four I stopped looking up at the stars at night. I stopped daydreaming. I tried to jam myself into moulds that other people made. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Two I would look up at the night sky in wonder and dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero, saving the world. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
One Our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world! [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial

UN 2018 speech. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
A Malaysian veteran artist seriously just said BTS UN speech are normal and nothing to be proud of,it’s only one achievement. Nothing to brag. When I’ve said people are beyond stupid,I mean her. I’m not going to be mad to an old people but that’s a reason why you are not famous.
his un speech was some other level of highness and superiority #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSGlobalVoting/status/1121341167163990017 …
We’ve tuned together in to watch @BTS_twt live on the AMAs, the BBMAs, and AGT. I was out of town when they were on Ellen but I called to make sure someone turned the TV to the station for her. She loved the UN speech. They bring her so much joy. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS
RM’s historical speech at the 73rd UN General Assembly for the launch of UNICEF’s “Generation Unlimited” initiative in which he urges everyone to“find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself”no matter their skin color or gender identity #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
I was sharing the link for #rm’s speech at 2018 UN Assembly, when I realised that “What is your name? Speak Yourself!" was the tag line of his message ! I am in awe of their attention to detail and continuity. @BTS_twt #rm #BBMAsTopSocial .https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/we-have-learned-love-ourselves-so-now-i-urge-you-speak-yourself …
Last year their speech at the UN This year-their performance on SNL (I don't know much about SNL but from avid watchers, I've heard that BTS were among few asians acts on it) #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
#FBF last Sept @ITU’s seat for the UN High Level Event on Youth 2030 was just a few feet away from K-Pop band @BTS_twt BTS works with @UNICEF to #ENDviolence They had an inspiring message of resilience and self-confidence. Video of their UN speech here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …pic.twitter.com/0NWf4lN8MN
When she said "I can't seem to like them." Y'all me and Roma went "That's fine, we're not pushing you to like BTS." I also made her watch the UN speech because she's doubting that Nj is smart and BTS we're helping a lot of people.
I feel so elated when I see the general population, regardless of age and gender, listening to BTS, their message, their UN Speech, their warmth and care and respect for Armys from all and sundry! It's such a proud moment literally. And I prod them ahead! Yes! They deserve LOVE!
First of all they are not racist have you not watch the UN speech and second of all why would I want to stan a group that doesn't even have a number one album on Billboard's
I urge you to speak yourself. What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? — UN speech #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/jd8o28KEbP
KBS, belia kan? So why not? I dunno how and what but KBS can work on something and bole relate dengan bts’s speech at the UN. You can tap on their anti violence campaign they had with UNICEF. +
It depends what you see first. I saw a dance practice video so of course I was drawn to the top dancers (Fake Love). If I would have read lyrics first or seen the UN speech, then my first bias would be rm, jhope, or suga. BTS #BBMAsTopSocial @BTS_twt
Our Kim Namjoon. His heart and thoughts.. He speaks to everyone's heart. Even to a*ntis. What a kind-hearted and thoughtful man.. Never forget his UN speech! #𓆦𓊸𓆙 @BTS_twt #BBMAsTopSocial BTS #BTS @BTS_twt #BBMAspic.twitter.com/tdIQ3TUj27
Forever proud of namjoonie for that speech at UN for UNICEF. Not all people have that bravery to delivery that kind of speech in front of all the influential persons. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
I just watched back the un speech. I was too immersed with the speech until I didn't even realize I cried along in the speech. It's a beautiful speech, Kim namjoon, thank you very much #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
UPDATE. MY PRESENTATION WENT FCKING GREAT. I talked about our boys' music, lyrics, End Violence, UN Speech, Grammy and everything important :') And everybody listened:') i am truly so so ssoooooo happy. [ #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt] https://twitter.com/praptychanda/status/1121721653371629568 …

BTS speech at UN & BTSxGrammys (for presenting an award) pic.twitter.com/rmJvkoZMcV
And gave them so much love and respect for them because the day before, BTS just gave a speech at UN! Yes that freaking UNITED NATION! And please bro, dont think that youtube is everything. From spotify, sales, streaming, tour, etc, BP is nowhere near to BTS level.
The video for the song set a new YouTube record with 74.6 million views in 24 hours. Check out their video for "Blood , Sweat & Tears", & their speech at the UN. These men are making history right now, & it's amazing to see.

Thank you for watching their un speech and not dismissing them. Namjoon (the one speaking english) was so nervous but he did his speech amazingly well. I’m proud of bts for being able to reach so many people and to transcend languages #BBMAsTopSocialArtist #BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/nasuhaakhalid_/status/1121263575257890816 …
my family once said that kpop is plastic but when bts on un and give speech about love yourself.. they gave respect to bts but ain’t love that kpop genres.. it’s okay if you don’t like kpop because it’s your opinion.. but don’t fcking hate them if they talk about good things bruh
u probably have never heard abt all the achievements bts made, all the lives theyve changed through their songs, probably have never heard their UN speech & all the things they did w UNICEF just bc theyre "kpop" doesnt mean theyre negative pic.twitter.com/gQFP7vBZTP
Amist all this bringbtstomalaysia drama, My mum: (rushed into my room and shouted) WHY IS BTS SO POPULAR? SAMOR GIVE SPEECH AT UN??? Me: Mum that was last yr's news can don't scare me like that ah
a junior 3 years below me wrote about BTS’s UN speech for her IRs Seminar class assignment and she started the background with the history of K-wave eye-
mature is the one aspect you CANNOT touch BTS on because if you have never heard the way they speak during interviews, if you have NEVER heard their speech at the UN, don't ever speak of BTS being immature because they are the complete opposite #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/ZaniZhariff/status/1121694771867574272 …
JUST SPEAK YOURSELF, a throwback to @BTS_twt's inspiring speech at the 2018 @UN General Assembly. This was a shining moment. This is what it means to be a Top Social Artist. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @bts_love_myselfpic.twitter.com/GbngwXIXFr
the UN speech that changed my perspective about myself, it was crazy to think that this 24 year old boy taught a 39 year old mother how to forgive and love herself again... #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1117215894407565313 …
If BTS bring bad influence, then they wouldn't team up with UNICEF for #ENDviolence. They wouldn't donate 3% of their ly series album to UNICEF. They wouldn't give a speech at UN, wouldn't be one of the most 100 influential people. Make it make sense.
This makes me realize the deeper meaning to Namjoon's speech at the UN when he asked us what our name is I've been trying to answer that question through a very limited understanding of what is actually being asked. I need to start everything again #BBMAsTopSocial BTS https://twitter.com/jungianLaura/status/1121547062603132928 …
i think everyone gets addicted to it at some point as an army lololol yeah i saw it when it came out on youtube and i really liked it- i didn't really get familiar with who they were as people until the UN speech though i was a casual fan #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
We were asked by our teacher to Deliver a speech. So I chose RM's speech at the UN Congress Assembly. Thank God it all happened smoothly , no mistakes I did this for you Army and @BTS_twt I Hope you'll be proud of me I love you guys #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/lfQfK6dsll
The UN speech by KNJ . That was so inspiring #BBMAsTopSocial + BTS ( @BTS_twt )

kpops popularity in the us. like YES gangnam style was insanely popular when it came out, but was psy winning social artist awards, getting invited to the grammys, or haveing a whole UN speech? im not trying to drag anybody but bts doesn't deserve the degradation yall give them.
I just tweeted this earlier but I will answer again and it's because of the UN Speech. #BBMAsTopSocial + BTS ( @BTS_twt)
RM. TBH i became a fan because of the UN Speech not because of their looks or songs (at first). I was so amazed of how joon is speaking for the youth and about loving ourselves #BBMAsTopSocial + BTS ( @BTS_twt)
I went to watch joon UN speech :((( #BBMAsTopSocial BTS

Namjoon at the UN speech #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
Kim Namjoon’s UN speech started me on the BTS path & it’s been a wonderful adventure ever since. Vote BTS #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
Malaysian politicians probably didnt know BTS spoke at the UN last year & their speech give a huge impact world wide more than our own PM's speech at the same assembly. They also probably didnt know all 7 BTS members are educated & one of them even have a master degree.
Army aged 45: since you're all so young, try this on your mother: -show her Namjoon's speech at UN -make her watch the MV of BS&T -buy her a copy of Hermann Hesse's Demian We will double the nb of Armys this way @BTS_twt #BBMAsTopSocial BTS

Kim Namjoon bec my devotion to BTS all began w his speech at the UN. I vote 4 BTS #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
It’s alright to not have a dream If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while It’s alright to stop Now we don’t run without knowing the destination #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt And Namjoon speech at UN
There’s a lot. But I’d have to say all of Namjoon’s speech at the UN. The whole speech especially the end really resonated with me. I was a crying/proud mess after his speech. It’s hard to describe how I felt. I’ve never felt anything like that. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt

Thank you for this! But there's so much more about @BTS_twt than just breaking YT records. Their UN speech, UNICEF campaign, their music, their awards and achievements for their artistry, their impact not just in SK but all around the world... #BBMAsTopSocial + BTS

Five Soon, I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Four I stopped looking up at the stars at night. I stopped daydreaming. I tried to jam myself into moulds that other people made. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Three In an intro to one of our early albums, there is a line that says, “My heart stopped…I was maybe nine or ten.” Looking back, that’s when I began to worry about what other people thought of me and started seeing myself through their eyes. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
Two I would look up at the night sky in wonder and dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero, saving the world. [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial
One Our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world! [UN Speech] BTS + #BBMAsTopSocial

Nope we don't need it, we have the cover of " "times", the speech of UN and so many award. U should say thanks to BTS for paving the way @BTS_twt #BBMAsTopSocial
bts was invited to grammy museum, to speech at UN, went to ellen, james corden, jimmy kimmel, the times not because most of the members fluent in english but bcs their talent and im proud about it.

Euphoria and Spring Day for me and the UN speech #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
UN speech should've been a skit on the album #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
Saw them on Graham Norton first. Did some digging and watched a few more MVs and performances. Then I found their UN speech and haven't looked back since #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
topics that should be discussed more: - climate change - ocean pollution - domestic violence - lgbtq+ rights - rm's speech at un #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
UN SPEECH! I was captivated bc they put asian culture in western media without minding the current racism and misrepresentation done by the latter. They were so smart and after watching more interviews I fell in love with their genuine selves #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt

Moots! Tell me 2-3 BTS related facts about you! I'll start: 1, I will be using RM's UN Speech as a topic for my students' finals. 3. I saw BTS live.

Well UN speech is THE moment, but maybe the most memorable moment for me was the first #BBMAsTopSocial Artist win. The moment when BTS knew it’s theirs.. It was after 5 am here, I had been an ARMY just a few months that time and it was so meaningful @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ugOR5UIgbt
Show her the UN speech!!! #BBMAsTopSocial BTS [ @BTS_twt]
I agree w/ comments. Tkful for the piece but no mention of RM's UN speech or their UNICEF campaign. Other BBands mentioned but there is no comparison bc BTS is/does so much more. It was ok but hope someone in US can expand on Halsey's words in TIME. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
This reminds me of Namjoon's UN speech. #BBMAsTopSocial + BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/QodYRyLWF7
I was gonna say when they got their first daesang but I remember back then I was super confident that they were gonna win so it really didn’t surprise me?? With the un speech I was full on bawling cause I was just so unbelievably proud of them #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @bts_twt
I honestly didn’t like many bits of it. As you mentioned, it would’ve been far more greater to introduce their meaningful lyrics, their campaign with UNICEF and Namjoons speech at the UN to show why bts are as loved as they’re today. BTS #BBMAsTopSocial

In the midst of depression I randomly found Namjoon's UN speech in YT, i didn't knew them at all but it felt like he was directly talking to me, following them was more of a therapy for me, these boys literally saved me... #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt

My love for BTS began w RM’s speech at UN. I was stunned by maturity & grace of this group. Once I listened 2 their music & watched them perform my love grew. I Vote #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt
I was also disappointed they made no real attempt to earn BTS credibility with the show's older audience. Not enough on lyrical content, the UN speech, their human ideals.
It was okay. We just thought your time and effort would have been more worth it if you talked about @BTS_twt UN speech, their UNICEF campaign, the meaning behind their music, etc. But thank you still for interviewing them and giving them a chance! #BBMAsTopSocial BTS
Mic drop and Fake Love. But it's safe to say that the UN speech by our humble great President Namjoon had me locked to the world. There was no turning back once I googled them. @BTS_twt are true family. #BBMAsTopSocial BTS
#BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt The UN speech always
That’s good fam in Jungian theory,we must face & accept our shadow(negatives) & keep a harmonious balance with everything,just like RM’s speech in UN & Jimin’s promise, etc. acknowledging & fighting our weaknesses/ negative sides are much better then ignoring it. I’m proud of u!
phewwwwwww imagine what a ride we’ve been in since the first tsa nomination :( we got so many american award appearances tv guestings ww records the un speech the sk govt officially recognizing them mama 2018 ,,,,,, wow . what a ride #BBMAsTopSocial BTS @BTS_twt

This is really interesting because I often thought how @BTS_twt compared life events as stars part of their constellation. (Song: Love myself: Answer) Namjoon mentioned this in his UN speech too, now I know what inspired him.
this happens when you are honest and hardworking. if you are honest and have never used money to climb up the ladder, you have to prove yourself each time to be on top. that is why they are so inspring, they are invited at UN for speech, @BTS_twt are one in a hundred billion.
I'm converting my family. Yesterday we were watching game of thrones and after it was over we were watching TV and the Bbmas commercial came out and my MOM and I screamed BTS! And my uncle was like who are they? And my mom showed him Nam's speech at the UN and that was it!
yeah but that 1/7 tu lah yg bagi speech kat UN, oh hun, bts paved the mf way :') sorry for keeping your hopes too high oomf- https://twitter.com/Amin_Nuestt/status/1120300118962343939 …
bts was invited to grammy museum, UN speech, presented at the grammys award, went to ellen, james corden, jimmy kimmel, is in the times most influential people of 2019, nominated for top group at billboard music award and then list go on. Now say that again.
But but but bts give speech at THE UN EVENTHO ONLY 1/7 SPEAK ENGLSIH. Btw BTS PAVED THE WAY
YES. THAT'S WHY NAMJOON, THE LEADER OF BTS WHO IS ALSO THE ENGLISH FLUENT SPEAKER OF THE GROUP GIVING SPEECH AT THE UN. ANYWAY BTS PAVED THE WAYS
i want to go back in time and tell 2013 bts that they're performing in america and giving a un speech and doing things that the industry of kpop never imagined i wanna see jimin be like (◎_◎;) no way and i wanna see namjoon not believe me but hope im RIGHT
THEY WERE SO EXCITED FOR A ROOKIE AWARD HOW DO U THINK 2013 BTS WOULD HAVE REACTED IF SOMEONE TOLD THEM THEYRE GOING TO THE GRAMMYS AND PRESENTING AMERICAN AWARDS AND GIVING A UN SPEECH AND WINNING BBMA AWARDS AND BREAKING RECORDS THE WAY I AM DEVASTATED RN
I think what always comes first...is loving yourself...youre obsessed over bts and one of the most important thing they taught us is loving ourselves... but u didn’t even imply that. Through the love yourself era, bts taught us all about loving ourself, and even the speech in UN. https://twitter.com/dailyhoping/status/1120298438065700867 …
Either namjoon’s speech at their first stadium tour.... I remember I watched it live and cried cause I felt so proud and loved??? Or bts at the UN.... it was just a huge turning point for them, I’m so proud:)
The amount of hate, racist, and sexist comments I've been seeing made by some of my now blocked mutuals that claim to follow BTS for their message is disgusting. Like please relearn BTS message and go watch Namjoons UN speech to educate yourself.
you might have to be a little more specific there there’s a lot of them, but I’m guessing you’re talking about Kim Namjoon. he’s the leader of a group called bts. you can check out their speech at the UN if you want :) https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg pic.twitter.com/4FR3HSNlqG
TY u don’t need to say sorry. I forget sometimes too. So why r you Army? I would love 2 know. My adventure started when I heard RM’s UN speech. Had to know more & the more I learned the more my devotion grew & it’s been a wonderful, inspiring & magical ride ever since @BTS_twt
Trilogy form (usually) and their last has been more of a mini series. T I told him about LY Her, Tear, & Answer & that I call this stadium tour is the Speak Yourself tour. I told him if he really wants to know what they are about, he should watch the BTS UN speech at the UN.

That C/B/S interview. I know it'smeant to be an 'intro' for people who've never heard of BTS, but parts of it are just poorly presented. For one, mentioning the merch to show commercial & economic impact is one thing, but why not mention their UNICEF campaign and the UN speech.
U should do a video with bts’ best speeches like the un meeting , the mama speech , namjoons vlive speech , taehyung speech about purple(those are just a few) . It would be beautiful
bts have already been proven to help a large amount of people with their lyrics, concepts and meanings. their UN speech opened peoples minds to self love and importance. they encourage their fans to donate to charity. they care so much about their fans.
I think I’m doomed to watch every Western media story about BTS and think about how much better it could be. There’s so much focus on the fan reaction and not enough on their music, their message, their UN speech. They’re not just a cash cow. https://twitter.com/CBSSunday/status/1119959535668609024 …
They mentioned the Mattel dolls but not the UN speech. Lost opportunity for Sunday Morning.
Here is the homework u asked for. Please make a whole video for BTS, react to Blood Sweat and Tears, check on google their most inspiring lyrics (search it like that), watch their UN speech and this live performance. That should be enough for now. https://youtu.be/G636qEIlCnY
It wasn't bad but could have been better. No mention of their UN speech, their Love Myself campaign with Unicef, & societal issues they tackle. They are more than just a boyband sensation. I wish you could have delved deeper into why they are really loved.
Y’ALL I MADE MY MOM LISTEN TO THE ICONIC UN SPEECH OF @BTS_twt SHE WAS SPEECHLESS!! LITERALLY, SHE DIDNT SAY ANYTHING
No social campaign to get them to the Grammys, there are older fans than just teenagers as well and they do a lot more than their music (charity/UN speech) to help their fans and people all over the world fyi. You could’ve ended it better than the dolls. It looks like you’re
Why doesn't anyone ever mention that they are also UNICEF ambassadors?? When they started their Love Myself Campaign and gave a speech at the UN, that made me so unbelievably proud. I just want them to get more recognition for it.
BTS do inspirational speeches during their concerts as well and I won’t have that so I’ll be playing Namjoon’s UN speech
BTS so inspirational speeches during their concert and I obviously won’t have that so instead I’ll be playing Namjoon’s UN speech
The "controversial" question isn't why I personally didn't like the interview. What bothered me was that they didn't touch on the reasons the target audience of the show would find BTS interesting; namely, their work with UNICEF, the UN speech, the message of their music, etc.
For ARMY @BTS_twt's music and messages are above everything. I had hoped you would have touched on that or maybe even Namjoon's UN speech, but still, while not perfect I thank you for your sincere efforts.
+I think you focused too much on mascots, fans=enthusiastic consumers, billboards, dolls etc. instead of their music (album mentioned halfway through without saying its name out loud), world stadium tour, UNICEF campaign, UN speech etc. Also, my mom's 50 and she's also a BTS fan
I love the show but I was a little disappointed in their coverage of BTS. They didn’t even talk about their positive message or even their UN speech, and got a few easily-looked-up things skewed or wrong. They just made them look like another ‘boy band’ sensation
Thank you for it! But I wish see their UN Speech, Social Campaign, the special lyrics because they are different for other groups and not only teenagers are fans.
. @BTS_twt on CBS was good but kinda hope they will address RM UN speech or talk about how they have a very deep messages in their songs. #BTSonSundayMorning
Thank you. The boys are awesome. Maybe you guys can re-visit with them when they are touring in US on the subject of their UN speech, philanthropy and message of loving yourself.
I think overall the interview was ok! of course yeah it would’ve been great for them to mention UN speech, their message, etc but it was ok overall...through this many Americans in the gp will know about the name bts and possibly research on them further
While it was a good segment I wish it would have digged deeper into what makes them so popular, their philantropy, meaningful lyrics and body of work as well as their UN speech and their advocacy for youth rights and Unicef campaign. The segment focused more on the industry......
Its okay but they could do better. Im just hoping they talk about the un speech and bts societal messages :/
I liked the intro to BTS by @CBSSunday but wish they had covered WHY they have a fanbase other than teens & WHY they are different from other “boy groups” …lyrics, music composition, addressing societal issues, etc. What about their charity work? UN speech? #BTSonSundayMorning
So surreal seeing @BTS_twt get such a long news segment on American tv! The one thing I wish they’d mentioned was the Love Myself charity campaign &/or the UN speech but it’s hard to cover everything about them & please everyone so I’m still very happy & proud #BTSonSundayMorning
they talked about the Mattel dolls but not bts’s message or UN speech
I was so proud of @BTS_twt on @CBSSunday. They answered all the questions well, and RM’s command of the English language impressed as usual. I wish there was mention of their charitable work, and the UN speech. This show’s audience is a new demographic. Waiting to see response.

Maybe Bts who gave a speech at the UN? Who took a picture with the president? or maybe you don’t know how to use google???
BTS are the biggest global music group from South Korea winning Billboards Top social Artists twice ( 2017 and 2018), nominated again for Top social Artists and Top group along with Maroon5 and Imagine Dragons, first Korean band to give speech in UN, nominated in Grammy's 2019
@BTS_twt namjoon, I know this is random, but I wanted to let you know how amazing your UN speech is. I'm currently analyzing it for my pragmatics class, and it truly is a work of art. Every word has so much meaning, and I am simply blown away by it all. Great job
I got my best friend I never told her to become an army.She was interested in BTS herself The UN speech has blown her away
UN speech. And this is what you called shit? Nahh it's fine, they(BTS) said you nice keep going https://twitter.com/myraclestobts/status/1119547327557984257 …
namjoon, in his un speech: "The faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life." kpoppies: bUt bTs mAdE mIstAKeS tOo https://twitter.com/blaqbfly/status/1119626380180897792 …
Not exactly the same but my grandmother listened to one of the songs when she was in the car with me and became interested. Nowadays she listens to mono a lot and just seems to be so happy whenever we talk about bts :). She was also very proud of their UN speech
This reminds me of when BTS came to nyc for gma and we had this reporter completely disregard the un speech, called their music noise, called them girls, said they were spreading their legs in the Idol choreo and that our fandom is full of underage girls, etc on national tv and+
This picture made me tear up; you all look so happy. Thank you for taking the time to get to know @BTS_twt a little bit. They mean so much to millions of us. To paraphrase Namjoon’s UN speech, we are all ages, countries, languages, cultures, genders, races. #BTSXSundayMorning
Than them and rack up much more money and views in a day that they wished they get in a month. We had wack ass news anchor in America who downplayed BTS’s speech at the UN because “they’re just a boy band from Korea”. It was more shameful because the anchor was black smh
. @BTS_twt r also know for their philanthropy, each personally donating to their own causes, but as a band, launched their #BTSLoveMyself campaign in partnership w/ @UNICEF, which has now raised $1.6M so far @bts_love_myself. RM also gave a speech @the UN. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1076405734097600512 …
Is this yall leader of that worldwide boy band who gave a UN speech? The one yall call President? You are not RM, this Joonie, why so cute @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/EHJQYpiJhU
TY 4 sharing. My BTS devotion began w RM’s speech @UN. Had 2 know more. Fell in love w grp of multitalented artists who even spoke 2 me - a older mom bec it’s not just youth that get sad - adults do 2. Army is awesome 2. I’m OT7 bec I identify w ea member 4 diff reasons #BTS_txt
Yeah the RM's UN speech was so amaze.. I'm speechless to hear that #BTS_twt
TY 4 sharing. My BTS obsession began w RM’s UN speech. I’m a mom & was so impressed by him that I had to know more. So down the BTS wormhole I went & have loved every min. I’m OT7 bec I bias ea 1 for diff reasons. They r all so amazing as individuals & 2gether superb #BTS_twt
and I don't like how she said that she can already hear all their fan girls screaming after Joons beautiful speech at the UN... it made the importance of this serious matter Joon was talking about seem like a joke to her
@BBCBreakfast even if we put aside all of bts’ achievements and the fact that they had a whole series of albums dedicated to helping the youth in partnership with the UN where they also delivered a brilliant speech, what’s wrong with this song doing well on yt?
Yeaahh i feel so luck that she finally understood what @BTS_twt meant to me♡ ang unexpected talaga nun sis hahahaha and I noticed that it all started after Namjoon had his speech at the UN. After nun parang lagi nalang nya sinasabi sakin "mamaya na yang bts mo" instead of ++
My granddaughter went thru a time like this. Each night she sat with her mom and watched the UN speech and talked about it. What it meant. Loving yourself. Not listening to what others think. It changed her outlook and she’s much stronger today because of it.
hhsjsjsjsj so i’m outside and i just checked her youtube watch history and since i went out she has alr watched namjoon’s UN speech and “How BTS Love Each Other - Try Not To Cry Challenge” I-

Girl I can't believe you support someone who said RM's UN speech was hypocritical, does sexual fanarts of the boys (with crabs, rj, trains like ????), says we are 14 y/o girls just because we stream the mvs, do I continue?? Are you even a bts stan
Great article They also talk about UN speech... @BTS_twt Korean pop sensation BTS go to top of UK album charts https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/19/korean-pop-sensation-bts-go-top-uk-album-charts/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw … via @telegraphnews
Ikr literally everyone loves him here ps yaknow his bio on IG is too similar to namjoon's UN speech
It mentions their GLOBAL boy band status. Their philanthropy. The good our boys do. The good ARMY does. UN speech and UNICEF campaign. I'm pleasantly surprised. Korean pop sensation BTS go to top of UK album charts https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/19/korean-pop-sensation-bts-go-top-uk-album-charts/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw … via @telegraphnews
. @BTS_twt ARMYS! SHARE & GIVE THIS ARTICLE CLICKS! "The Telegraph" is one of the most SERIOUS newspapers & this piece TALKS abt BTS & ARMYS PHILANTHROPY, the @UNICEF campaign & RM's UN SPEECH. For most readers, this'll be their 1st BTS encounter. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/19/korean-pop-sensation-bts-go-top-uk-album-charts/ …
BTS is not that,sorry if that’s what you heard,but they are the complete opposite of 1D,they teach us to love our selfs,and be confident,they gave a speech at the UN about a campaign they started with unicef to give better education,they Started from the bottom now look at them
First korean group going to BBMA and winning the award? First korean act speech at UN? First korean group going to Grammy and being MC? First korean act at #1 on billboard 200? First korean act debuts at number 1 on official UK Albums chart? @BTS_twt ( ͡°❥ ͡°) #PersonaUKNumber1
SK should def designate @bts_twt as living cultural assets! I think so every time I listen to #SpringDay, watch #BTS' performance of #Idol @the 2018 MMAs, read #RM's UN speech, see #ARMYs learning Korean, contributing to charities, & sharing mutual mental health support
thats funny how in his UN speech namjoon said “speak yourself “, so basically “use your own words to express yourself “ and how words in french is “ mots” and mots in bts and Army language means : Map of the soul In conclusion: this trilogy is for the french
i always think about the fact that bts fave that speech at the UN in september like that was long ago???? it feels like it was just last week but at the same time it feels like it was over a year ago it’s so weird
woah yall i cant believe bts didnt put their UN speech in mots: persona like,,, such a disappointment pic.twitter.com/rF6latTu0l
Thank you for reminding me of Namjoon's speech at the UN.
Y'all spread Namjoon' speech in the UN, talk about how BTS give us beautiful messages but when one fanbase support a song about our planet y'all act like never learned anything about what BTS taught us This song and video will not end @BTS_twt career so CAN Y'ALL CHILL?
but bts aren't even talked about when they hold a fucking speech at the UN i'm just saying when bts get their first grammy and germany still won't talk about them we know what's up THEY'RE CHARTING HERE FOR DIONYSUS' SAKE C H A R T I N G AND YET NOTHING
They gave a speech at the UN on behalf of UNICEF- they were partners for BTS's Love Yourself campaign that raised funds for children suffering from abuse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
It's not about the age. I am 31 years old. I work and study. They can sing, I would recommend you to watch them perform in SNL or any other live performance. Also their speech in UN. People follow them for their music and because they show us a better world.
Like BTS’s leader Kim Namjoon said in his UN speech, “I urge you to speak yourself. I would like to ask all of you, ‘What is your name?,’ ‘What excites you and makes your heart beat?’ Tell me your story.” I’m Aubrey, and I’m graduating with Honors! Inspired by @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/CmpDTRDtQN
I am a person who was depressed and had anxiety but now am so much better. It didn't happen overnight because i love them but did happen gradually little by little. RM speech at UN was the turning point in my life.
@BTS_twt with their genuineness have changed millions people in the world, help them overcome their life struggles, impact Korean economy with tourism n export goods, spread korean culture around the world, be UN ambassador n give speech in UN HQ, TIME 100 influence people 2019
Today my friend told me she watched the @BTS_twt UN speech and I got really happy until she said the one that looked like Ellen did a good job RIP #Rm #BTS pic.twitter.com/RuxcTZwFWE
You should've added how she said shits about Namjoon's speech at UN, kinda created fanwar between eggs and armchairs by calling b@ek walmart and Ta3 chanel. She also complained about how BTS only confirmed about the speak yourself tour 5 days ago the sale but she still got 3 tix
So I let her watch Namjoon’s speech at the UN, and at the end she smiled Namjoon’s impact uwu She said her favorite member is Namjoon ahagshhdcbjdjdndjsjsj @BTS_twt
Good luck!! I hope your wishes come true end of the concert. My 16 and 20 years old thinking same about me since i watched RM's UN Unicef speech on the news and started to search about BTS.
Remember when bts were invited to make a speech at UN, debut stage at the amas, bbmas tsa award 2 years in a row, album cover nominated and went to the grammy, comeback stage at the snl, cultural merit award , riaa gold and platinum certificate, outsold wembley in less than 2hrs
After months of hard work (not really) I'm finally able to differentiate one guy from rest of the BTS group. Well I still don't know his name but I think he is the one who gave speech at UN. If this continues I might be able to differentiate all the guys before the band disbands
To inspiration from literature https://www.soompi.com/article/1317010wpp/9-bts-songs-that-drew-inspiration-from-literature … To speech at UN for UNICEF campaign https://youtu.be/BF5ZQ1loXVQ . Pls don’t make false accusations & narrowly define BTS by one genre bec they do it all & meld genres together expertly as evidenced in new album Map of Soul:Persona
I think about that a lot too. Like if we're this proud of @BTS_twt, their parents must be through the clouds. Like I buy my mom one breakfast at IHOP, and she tells everyone who'll listen what a great daughter I am. Can you imagine Joon's mom and the UN speech?
Every time I'm sad I just listen to Namjoon's UN speech and feel better. I am always thankful for this handsome, smart, and thoughtful man. #LeaderNamjoon @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xvwsmxNvqT
Welcome! I fell in when they were invited to address the UN last September and Namjoon's speech shook something loose in my heart. It encouraged me to dig into BTS and their fandom. They've been a lifesaver.
Whatever you do, tell them the truth especially for safety reasons. Let them know you are going to meet up with positive, like-minded people who believe in the power of music and community. Show them the UN speech and explain that with @BTS_twt we are off to change the world! GL!
people be coming at bts like magazine covers are more important than a UN speech, a cultural merit award, a Grammy nom, shall I continue??
Maam u need to watch their un speech they're really so nice Their in speech please do check them out they're the sweetest boys ever https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
@BTS_twt on the news here in Israel, I'm shocked! They mentioned the UN speech and their worldwide popularity, and even played part of BWL pic.twitter.com/dJZVtUK7Vo
Well u need to see this it's their un speech https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Just got asked by a friend where they should start their BTS journey. What a loaded question and I honestly don't even know how to respond. MVs? Articles? Bangtan Bombs? UN speech? We need an #ARMY toolkit , or maybe an article (Does this exist?) cc: @TamarWrites @thisisridz
I just showed my dad the UN speech and afterwards he said ‘that was amazing I should really be looking into more bts now shouldn’t i’
yall im watching namjoon's un speech again and i'm just so.... bts really are the best huh, they're really something special and i treasure all of them so much. each one of them is so thoughtful and humble and greatful and i would like to think they've really helped me to
Remember how after BTS‘ UN speech everyone surrounded them?
She's really disgusting and hypocrite. She called out ARMYs for shipping two members and here she's shipping and making fanarts with cartoon characters. She said shits about Namjoon's speech at UN and then boasted about how she got 3 tickets of BTS concert but still dissed them+
BTS is truly the most influential people out there, from making a whole campaign to end violence to giving the Speak Yourself speech at the UN. From NGL to Top 100 Most Influential People, BTS really did that, and proud is an understatement. #TIME100pic.twitter.com/p9PlPOW9k0
Just show her BTS UN speech!
Yo i swear whenever someone posts something promoting bts ya'll put the UN speech up sksks ldkskakdkakssjakkskdskafjdksk
Dude she also called BTS colorist and trashed Joon's UN speech as well as other stuff. She's trash, stop defending her.
Its really well deserve. Last year was already iconic year for BTS. From getting two no. 1 billboard 200 to give speech at UN, to give impact about 3.6bil to korea and one of the major reasons for foreigners coming to korea, they really make such impact to korea n world.
Just got the news that i am the 2nd place winner for last week's speech competition (the one that i used namjoon's un speech as material) It was a memorable experience since this kind of thing is outside of my comfort zone. So are you proud of me yet @BTS_twt Thanks guys pic.twitter.com/pmkEyttaRw
Can we talk about the amazing description of #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA by @AppleMusic ??? It mentions the UN speech, the topic of self-acceptance in Answer, Carl Jung’s theories and all of the things that @BTS_twt is trying to transmit to the world. Thank you for this!! pic.twitter.com/a97cRDebN4
hey im going to an interview this saturday,and i really really want to include bts in my topic,so can you dropped… — the UN speech!! https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1117215894407565313?s=19 … https://curiouscat.me/lgq7/post/850332067?t=1555493744 …

Thanks:) Ya saw their UN Speech. I admire them. Thanks for welcoming me. Marami-raming review pa gagawin ko about BTS. Ahahaha
...so these “buncy of clowns” make a big group compared to others. Just a single trash tweet from them garners thousands of retweets. BTS said in their UN speech: “speak yourself” and use your voice. I think they can use theirs to address crazy behavior by kpop fans in general.
Hi bts have an expansive discography ranging from ballads to even rock they also have a variety of interviews talking about their music and their intentions of promoting self love such as their leaders UN 2018 speech! If you need recommendations I’m willing to help out !
Totally! They made such an impact in the UN speech to their campaign. Followed by two #1 albums in BBMA as a pioneer for S.Korea group. And the list goes on.
not crackhead material but BTS's SPEECH AT THE UN
Among so many worthy candidates I’m honored that @BTS_twt was even included! They’re using their voices to spread msgs of self-love, hope & acceptance. So proud of them! Watch their speech at the @UN to learn more abt who they are & what they stand for: pic.twitter.com/QQjMKbw2rH

THE UN SPEECH!!!! I ALWAYS CRY!!! BTS HAS ME!!! W H I P P E D !!!!
LRT: the largest news channel in Brazil did a 6 minute report on BTS, and they included them breaking the yt record, their UN speech, and how much they inspire ARMY
BTS - Boy With Luv Explained by a Korean https://youtu.be/qWGdUwmvSws i havent cried that much since Namjoons speech at the UN
okay about the report: they showed boy in luv, boy with luv, mic drop and fake love showed the un speech said the views in 24hr were 78M complimented bts and kpop in general
they just talked abt @BTS_twt on the news here in ! it was so beautiful! they talked abt our record on yt, the speech at un, how important they are to korea and its culture, how hard they must practice every day, their msgs in their songs, how they value the group and not indiv
it was also a pleasant surprise when dr. stein mentioned rm's un speech, and that the nuances of the korean lyrics were taken into consideration. one can easily tell how well-prepared for this was and we appreciate it greatly. i'm also glad you seemed to enjoy the album
I;m writing an essay for English about bts, their love yourself campaign, the money they've raised for Unicef, their end violence campaign, and their speech at the UN. if anyone has any links I could use that would be great but I can't wait to write this uwu
Also, the Pride flag and the transgender flag have hues of pink in it. If you know the boys well, you know Namjoon said in the UN Speech 'No matter what your gender identity is #speakyourself'. It really seem the album in focused on this and the LGBTQ community #BTS @BTS_twt
There is a long ass Norwegian article about bts talking about bot with luv, our goals for this comeback, how bts were formed and became big, the fans, the UN speech and burn the stage we- pic.twitter.com/PRzIapRuUG
Right omg. Namjoon was what made me stan bts after his speech at the UN. Before I casually listened to their music and thought the members were handsome, but the message "Love yourself before others" really got to me at a difficult time and was the root to my problem.
i used joon’s UN speech for my speech analysis and i also wrote a speech about why BTS deserves a nobel peace prize for english class ! involving them in school assignments is actually so fun, and i get to showcase their achievements and prove their impact !
I'm crying because my?? friend?? asked me to write an article about BTS giving speech in the UN?? (I'm an International relations student)???
Every time @BTS_twt comes back to South Korea they achieved another level of success!! I sometimes wonder how they feel... past times: 1. performing at the BBMAs 2. performing at @AGT 3. UN speech 4. @FallonTonight 5. Citifield 5. Grammys... WOW!!! I am very proud of them
But tbh my aunt was a binus lecturer and she used their UN speech in her class lol
Ok but BTS went to the grammys, snl and did a fucking speech at the UN /and/ is constantly acknowledged as the biggest band internationally but exo is on top how exactly? If you want an apology, you ain't gettin one by attacking us ffs
i mean,,, they invalidated a grammy nomination, a speech at the UN, several kmas, and literally anything that bts touches so are we surprised https://twitter.com/kimvanadium/status/1117648280249196544 …
This might be my favorite quotes though from the @BTS_twt UN Speech #LoveYourself #SpeakYourself #BTS #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/XktYhTn2Xi
Ever think about how kim namjoon casually spoiled their tour at a UN speech in front of the world? Bts run the world o.O
Namjoon (RM) writes and produces a lot of the music for @BTS_twt he is the band's leader and translator, as he's fluent in English. What I've found most amazing about him is his way with words. Check out his UN speech; you'll see what I mean #GetToKnowBTS_Persona
So one of the admins at BTS BELGIUM got interviewed on the radio and did an INCREDIBLE job promoting our boys!! I'm so proud and impressed!! She mentioned: •their music + messages •the UN speech •TSA award •YT records • @BTS_twt and ARMYs charity work https://twitter.com/BANGTAN_BE/status/1117846352006926336 …
Maybe I can help. I believe it's because BTS has consistently spoken about positive values, like their UN speech & their lyrics about mental health, self love, dreams, societal pressures. They've healed many of us & make us want to be better people pic.twitter.com/WkZ2cnWAit
RM is the one held UN speech! What are you talking about! Many idols learned English & speak perfectly to be able to deliver & express themselves in interviews. And BTS the global aiming group still can't say couple of English sentences without looking at RM with blank face!!
He is incharge of translation.. @BTS_twt (Must listen to his UN speech)@chim_official13
the leader with a beautiful mind...his UN speech is the reason why I became an ARMY...
BF: “You know, BTS is great. I like their music even if I don’t understand them. I like that guy, the one who speaks really good english, the one who did the UN speech.” Me: *how to tell him that he’s stanning my future husband tho*
Oh Joon! He was shaking during the UN speech, too. You blink you miss it. But, like all BTS members, he's a TOTAL PRO! You did so well, love! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/moonlightmates/status/1117489651521081346 …
BTS helped me love myself with the songs they wrote,the way they acted and RM's speech at UN
Most of our parents don't mind us listening to BTS because ,unlike you, they thought us how to love ourselves and even gave a speech at the UN about self love and empowerment :)
when I first started stanning bts I snuck in some audio of joon’s UN speech into a video project I had for an art class. Here’s a bit of it. this version of the video is shit, but it fit the prompt of the project more :/ I wish I had the first version because it was way nicer,, pic.twitter.com/AyZAUukOqS
Namjoon's UN Speech always leave tears in my eyes. They taught me to love myself for who and what I am. They taught me to Love Myself even more. I stan real artists, I stan real idols. I will never doubt that. Thank you for existing. @BTS_twt @bts_bighit https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2049931161698324&id=68793499001&sfnsn=mo …
If they are coming back in this is not something random... They were trying to show us something as they did! With BTS anything is meaningless check out their UN speech if you haven’t!! But as I’ve said thank you for doing this review
That's why we're so proud of them @BTS_twt Time Cover magazine, UNICEF ambassador, speech in UN HQ Thanks so much pic.twitter.com/8IPRLRthdW
In 'HOME', @BTS_twt talk about ARMY as their home. RM talked about coming from a small town in his UN speech, and him now being a worldwide celebrity means travelling all around the world – but since ARMY exist all around the world, too, he always has a home wherever he goes.
i think ARMY who said its kpop tradition should do homework.. -go stream BWL 1000x -watch A.L.L BTS mv in bighit channel -watch BTS speech (UN, MAMA, and A.L.L award speech out there) -look at history.. we are not kpop anymore.. we already volunteer getting out from kpop
I cried to first time I heard the BTS speech at the UN. Am I allowed to cry, again? @BTS_twt #BTS #LoveYourselfhttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1117215894407565313 …
i still can't believe jab mene mama ko first time namjoon ki un unicef speech dikhai thii tou she was so impressed & watched it 3-4 times. her words: kitna accha bolta hei! isla kia naam hei? she was smiling so hard and has stanned him since @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
@FBE please react to Boy With Luv by BTS feat. Halsey, it was recently broke the record as the most viewed video in 24 hours and the fastest video that hits 100M in just 36 hours. Would appreciate it if you also show their speech at the UN and their debut stage on SNL. Thanks!
Who the 1st Kpop Group that give speech at UN? BTS pic.twitter.com/aXgJosne34
my family saw BTS’s UN speech and finally took my love for them seriously dnsmdneksnand thank god
Namjoon oppa had me dumbfounded at first with his UN speech i still like him but Yoongi oppa is my bias now Though all of them are my favorite people @BTS_twt
but she's not the one who introduced me to bts 'cause at home its rare for her to blast bts on speakers. I fell this rabbit hole (HAHA) bcs...... 1. KIM NAMJOON'S UN SPEECH 2. TAEJIN MOMENT IN "SO WHAT"
I have never uwued harder In my life. Told my bf some random stuff about bts like their un speech or their collab with YouTube n burn the stage and he literally just said “shai I really find bts interesting... burn the stage is a fresh group” HE CALLED THEM BURN THE STAGE EYE-
Maybe watch their lives so you can hear for yourself they actually sing great. Since you seem like the kinda person who likes deep things I think checking out their lyrics and Namjoons UN speech can show you what Bts are all about. You dont have to but please be respectful.
bts performed on big stages, outsold stadiums, teamed up with unicef, had their un speech, donated lots of money, broke 100s of records, helped people in serious situations and spread love and who are you? what made you racist and disrespectful? they have manners learn from them
Yes we are so proud of him. He did a speech at the UN general assembly last year since BTS are ambassadors for UNICEF with their long-running campaign against violence. I'm sorry. I'm talking too much. Maybe this is how proud moms feel like.
I can complete the tweet Bts performed at BBMAS,AGT,SNL,GMA + ... (including the speech at Un)first https://twitter.com/charlie29579138/status/940635659638800384 …

I have a few YouTube series I’m going to look up, after I listen to these suggestions and the UN speech !
They write their own songs and work with UNICEF Campaign #ENDviolence #loveyourself they even invited at UN speech.. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1117215894407565313?s=19 …
And their UN speech! pic.twitter.com/StuiZuTfGP
They're a seven member group from South Korea, who write and produce their music, including topics like self love or mental health, and are influencing many people. For example, check out their UN speech: https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
Good morning @BTS_twt had their comeback stage on SNL, they presented an award at the Grammys and gave a speech at the UN in the span of one year
my friend wants me to show her some bts stuff, she saw Joons UN speech and wants to get into them, any recommendations/ suggestions?
My mom is pretty much familiar with them now cause it's my 3rd time going to their concert anyway. She's learnt about BTS like a year ago. And the way she's just called me to ask how was the concert last week. Lol. She recognised namjoon becuase of the UN speech which was on news
i think she's an army now. i've seen her tweeting about bts' un speech. but sis please don't rub them crotches
well that's not exactly a social issue they do talk about mental health though and they are in partnership with UNICEF for the Love Myself campaign. and on their UN speech last time, they have been encouraging the youth to speak theirselves and share their stories.
It's okay prophet Noel, BTS will not be everyone's cup of tea. Thanks for your honest opinion. And just like what #RM the leader expressed on there UN Speech - "No matter who you are, where you're from, your gender-identity, just #SpeakYourself - Kim Namjoon of BTS pic.twitter.com/9B3yZyMBp7
I’m into rock & the last time I was into a “boy band” was when I was 12. So @BTS_twt wasn’t going to be in my radar. But then the UN speech & causes: my respect. Their creativity, work ethic & performances: my admiration. Their personalities, humility, & generosity: my love.
He is President of Armys Please watch UN speech!!!!! RM produced, wrotten most songs of BTS, He is Genius, with IQ 148 He released two mixtapes!!! His songs, lyrics deep, psychlogical, philosophical, Watch to RM- Joke, Do you, moonchild, Persona, Rain, Reflexion on you tube
KWKEKWKKWE i'm not lying this is me after UN Speech @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BangtanSeaDayak/status/1117337380929687554 …
you're using namjoon's words in a un speech talking about how armys are the best fandom because many armys do donations on bts' name and are nice to people who have a platform and talk about them, you're using namjoon and generalizing a whole fandom over something some people did
You should check out their UN speech as well. Give them a chance, they experiment with multiple genres! Also I couldn't help but notice that in the video that was playing while Jeff were talking a lot of video cuts weren't from BTS concerts but from other pop concerts.
i can almost recite president Namjoon's UN speech word for word. @bts_twt #BTS #SNL #BTSXSNL #BoyWithLuv100M #FakeLove500M
Thank you for reporting on BTS!! Check out their UN speech that they did last year for the Generation Unlimited movement!! Very inspirational and shows how they are more than a "typical boy band"! (PS: Years, Jeff?Years? Okay. We will let this one go.)
BTS actually make the world a different place. They're talking abt social and political themes, mental health, about the struggle of young people. Maybe do some research, listen to their UN speech& stop judging to soon. Prejudices are actually something they're talking about too.

They are pretty boys! But that’s not the only reason people love them :) bts lyrics are really deep & introspective. They sing about mental health, adulthood, self-love, the struggles of navigating youth, etc. Here’s a speech they did at the UN for UNICEF: https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156?s=21 …
They are BTS. extremely popular right now with credits such as a UN speech and Grammy nomination. They have tons of music with meaningful messages regarding today’s social issues if you ever wanted to listen. And mr blue hair, is Kim Taehyung or V

AHH I know you didn't ask for other stuff but please, if you have time and haven't seen it yet, please check out BTS' speech at the UN (given by RM, their leader). It is a good representation of some of the messages they try to send through their songs.
seeing locals tweet about @BTS_twt seeing more promotion of previous BTS albums seeing reposts of RM's speech at the UN they made it. they made it. they made it. BTS did that. they did all of it. #BTSxSNL
Asdfghjls pls Dad: is that... Bts? Me: Yep. You know them? Dad: yeah, I watched their UN speech. Wow they can sing and dance really well. Me: They're idols.... Ofc they can.... Dad: I watch a UN speech not a stage okay? Thought they're just all smart and pretty for the photos!
They are BTS, a korean boyband who are extremely possible. They have tons of songs, with the majority dealing with major social issues of today. They have been nominated for the grammy's and given a speech at the UN, and continue to inspire young and old alike through their

Okay i know, geez. Blinks, you really don't have to go to every BTS' achievements posts to announce that your BlackPink is performing at Coachella. Like, srly, should i go to every BP's posts to say "hey BTS has made a speech at the UN"? #BTSBillboardTopSocialArtist @BTS_twt
i said this when joon dud their speech for UN and I regretted it af js lol
We need another Un speech PLEAse
BTS are doing so much good around for the millions of people who follow them. They're so inspiring and real and this UN speech RM gave is just amazing.
I'll keep sharing this @BTS_twt UN speech until the end of time. #ENDviolence #SPEAK_YOURSELF
they've achieved & done so many wonderful things in the past few years; sold out tours, numerous awards, UN meeting speech, taught people to love themselves & now have the fastest mv to reach 100 million views. bts' history is forever. #BoyWithLuv100Mpic.twitter.com/UW5FMl7rjT
I absolutely love this, and the article includes their UN speech, which I hadn’t watched in months, but re-watched today and it just reaffirmed everything that I love about @BTS_twt #BTSPavedTheWayhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent/status/1117140425981218816 …
@bts_bighit @BTS_twt is indeed the biggest kpop act and i respected them during their UN speech,such a role model.But sadly the fandom show otherwise.There are lot of good armys but a lot of bullies & psychos too.Hope they reflect on their idols and be a role model just like them
please watch/listen/read RM's entire speech at the UN. RM actually did NOT speak much at all about his group or their fans. ACTUALLY, he encouraged today's YOUTH to find themselves and SPEAK THEIR TRUTH, #SpeakYourself being the catch phrase he coined. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156/video/1 …pic.twitter.com/KpMfyHYpY3

how was it to give such a meaningful speech at the UN ? #SykeAsksBTS
True with good reason I mean I'm a K-POP Stan.. But no... Just no... Well other than BTS's speech at the UN where the Leader was talking about loving yourself
i talked to my grandma about how bts is so different from your average idol. i literally went from their lyrics, mvs and songs to namjoon’s UN speech. she said she’s proud of me for stanning someone with this sense of purpose (penge pera pang concert tix hehe)
CONFIRMED my dad is a bts stan, his favourite song is the truth untold and he loved Joons UN speech
Look, even he's a leader, giving so much speech for award, for comeback, for UN, this little maknae still need his oldest hyung thank you seokjin for being there for joonie what is cryyyyy @BTS_twt #BoyWithLuv https://twitter.com/yoonjns/status/1116698621033046019 …
of curiosity to BTS. BTS share the same interest to ARMY. Remember RM in UN speech did wish their music to inspire ppl to know urself, find ur identity n speak urself. As much as BTS share their life story showing gd positive side 2 motivate army, BTS wish ARMY to find own voices
the message they’ve been trying to show us. Its like Namjoon said in BTS’s UN speech, “yesterday’s me is still me.” This album is purely BTS in their truest form. Sure they’re showing us different sounds, music wise, but their message is still the same.
You could write an inspiring speech about love yourself to fellow students like Joonie's UN speech. Tell them its ok to be themselves and never give up Good luck for tomorrow
The First Lady of South Korea sharing Namjoon's message from his UN speech & #LoveMyself.. I cried a little bit.. #LOVE_YOURSELF #BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/Mylife_KTV/status/1117004559434440705 …
BTS is actually heavily involved in their music, songwriting, and artistic direction - it's something all the members are very passionate about. They're very active in giving back to communities and campaigning for young people too - you should check out the UN speech they gave!
A good mix of both? We haven't had a comeback since UN speech time which had so many BTS events before & after that brought in tons of fans..and trying to educate each other on streaming & buying methods...truly THE calmest & most stress free comeback I've experienced to date tbh
what we're NOT gonna do is use Namjoon's UN speech as a meme or a joke. this ain't it.
listen i'm not tryna tell bts what they should or shouldn't do but if the had put namjoons un speech on the album oof could yall IMAGINE
Watch videos like Mr Bean, meme compilations, Try mot to laugh, galaxy videos, whale videos, Namjoon's UN speech, maybe some Maths/chemistry videos.. Or u can watch crack videos.. Enjoy this experience @BTS_twt #StreamPartyBangwarts
@FBE It would be much appreciated if you post a react to Boy With Luv, a BTS track feat. Halsey, and perhaps with a mention of several records that they already break as a Korean artist and also their speech at the UN. Thank you
bts broke gender stereotypes, gave a speech at the UN about loving yourself and wrote a song about a healthy love story but they are still getting reduced to a weird phenomenon on SNL, locals just don’t get it pic.twitter.com/SGNspev8dp
also she’s at the UN like hnnnnn joonie’s speech was there bts was there hhhhhhrrjdjd
it's now hitting me... that Answer era is over... the era that lasted nearly a year, that contained amazing concert memories, the @BTS_twt UN speech, Grammys, and more... May the new era be just as amazing Persona era is off to a great start!
This is one speech they gave at the UN where the talk about equality, no discrimination and #ENDviolence through their Love Yourself campaign!pic.twitter.com/K4yZCQ2Fnz
PLEASE give them a try! bts have become bigger than a boyband by giving a speech @the UN and selling out 90k+ capacity stadiums more than once. they focus on mental health and self-love topics. they are Grammy nominated and have 3M pre orders which is a first in Korea.
the story didn't end! 2day he sent boy with luv mv, i think may be he thought i had no idea abt the mv and told him there's a whole album n sent him the Spotify link of the album.he was like exo sounds like BTS!I avoided the qustn n sent him the un speech since he lkes speeches+

THEYRE TALKING ABOUT THE UN SPEECH @BTS_twt #BoyWithLuvOutNow #FindYourPERSONA #BTSxHalsey
Elvis said he hopes the gp will be open to listening to BTS because of their genuinity, and he mentioned the UN speech! He also said “don’t call them a boy band! Don’t put them in a ditch like that!” Lmao
hoseok's world peace no way is to shut those antis who want bts un speech to end world hunger
Released in April 11, 1952, Singin' in the Rain was set during the time when silent films were transitioning to "talkies", which fits in with BTS's concept of Speak Yourself, a concept they initially mentioned in last year's speech at the UN. #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
mikrokosmos = piano pieces micro = tiny cosmos = universe BTS ARE SAYING THAT MUSIC HAS THE ABILITY TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH WE’RE TINY AND THE UNIVERSE IS SO HUGE AKA NAMJOON’S UN SPEECH DON’T TOUCH ME #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #Mikrokosmos #PERSONAWelcomePartypic.twitter.com/CvavwVpnl8

This the first lady of south korea spoke about bts in her speech in Washington specifically rm UN speech https://twitter.com/BTSEGYPTIANARMY/status/1116387566142488579 …
what if i just got a whole row of tiny QR code tattoos that link to bts' impt moments like joon's un speech
literally my BTS ego bout to fly out the window. every other group can go home. boy groups? GO HOME. girl groups? GO HOME. NO GRAMMY NOM, UN SPEECH, HALSEY COLLAB, X2 TIME BBMA WINNER, ED SHEERAN COLLAB, NO OPINION!!!!! PERIOD !!!!!!!
A quick one tho, BTS speech at the UN isn’t just 3 minute long but roughly around 6mins. I also wish that all 12 were about BTS not some 3 parts of it were about KPOP. But I thank you for effort of writing one. Droppin the full UN speech link here; https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg pic.twitter.com/6UZdlnsjS6
Tie between Dope, Not Today and Mic Drop. What sealed the deal for me was not only the music but the UN speech, they are amazing people @BTS_twt
i just save funny memes or videos i like to watch all the time. for example, stupid bts memes, fancams or things like namjoons UN speech

Why am I so self destructive, no one made my watch bts' acceptance speech at mama Hong Kong 2018 and no one made me watch Joon's un speech immediately after but here I am, 9 hours before my first comeback with them, a sobbing mess because I can't control myself
BTS are a group of Korean artists who have gained global success for their music and contrition to world charities such as Unicef(allowing them to even give a speech at the UN). If you wish to know more, their latest album will drop in 10 hours. @BTS_twt
& I tell her that BTS is more than just attractive guys we fangirl over. I told her about their vivid personalities, their mindful lyrics, their UN speech, their charitableness, & their positive message they encourage fans w/ worldwide- I also said the fan base is very diverse!! pic.twitter.com/CjmkKaPNdt
HOW SWEET AND THOUGHTFUL IS THAT VIDEO AND @BTS_twt COMEBACK AS A WHOLE? I EVEN ANSWERED HOBI IN THE TAG. THEY LOVE US SO MUCH I HAD NO IDEA THEY'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT AWWW IT ONLY MAKES SENSE WITH NAMJOON'S HINTS AT THE UN SPEECH. And congrats @TheJose8A this is so lovely
ESPECIALLY since @BTS_twt already has such a good reputation with GP since their speech at the UN, features in TIME and Entertainment Weekly, appearance at the Grammys AND on SNL! This CB is gonna be really something. Am excitement :3
Have they gotten in touch with Dr. Murray Stein? The respected writer had appreciated their music as well as the UN speech. What are your thoughts on this?
https://youtu.be/kWMzL20sImg watch the speech they gave recently at the UN. They are wonderful people.
They are more than just their social media presence. They are super talented, funny, caring individuals. Check them out. You will not be disappointed. Here is the speech the gave at the UN. https://youtu.be/kWMzL20sImg
the first lady of korea talking about how her favorite band is bts and how she wants to mention joons UN speech and loving yourself while she visited schools .... their impact .
Yes it is. His name is Kim Nam Joon but commonly known as RM. he is the leader of the group and also knows how to speak English. He and the other BTS members went to the UN to give a message.

@BTS_twt yesterday I gave my first speech on end violence love yourself campaign all inspired by BTS n ending it with Namjoon's powerful UN message in front my class n teacher in my college I was so excited for this I always wanted to represent u my teacher loved it
same with me... luv bts coz speech namjoon at UN
New here and this is my first CB. I know Jin before BTS. I am sceptical about the UN speech about speak yourself and if it is true that Jin only get 10s instead of fair share in their main title song. Assess that y'all are hypocrite. It is only for concept and mktg.
She gave a speech un the womens march she seems pretty nice person
The fact that BTS have so much things they could brag about openly but the only thing they brag about is ARMYs... That hurts in the sweetest way possible and makes me want to work even harder for them 'We truly have the best fans in the world' - Namjoon, UN speech :') @BTS_twt
Y'all already know I just had to integrate BTS somehow into my cover video for my senior portfolio And ofc I used a quote from namjoon's UN speech, mayhaps I snapped.
for me, it’s so hard to choose but the un speech + all of mono and the lyrics to reflection, uhgood and everythinggoes and that clip where he’s petting a lil bear and when he talks to lil frogs and catches crabs and when he looks at bts like they’re his whole world

Which is a negative influence leading suicide. But opposition brought up about artist spreading messages to end violence as well so it is a postive influence, they gave an example which was BTS going to the UN to give their speech on the LOVE MYSELF unicef campaign. +++ #BTS

So..I just got up and it's currently 9AM and I'm in my grandparent's home. And I showed the UN speech to my grandfather 4-5 days ago and said you guys are really wonderful talking about those underrated things! I felt proud
I submitted my governement paper on: A Gateway to Human Right Through Empathy, and cited the UN Speech!! also,,, MAYBE TOMORROWS COMEBACK?!?!?!?!

I dont think they are really listening bts songs or payed attention to namjoon 's speech at the UN to understand what this fandom stand for I think that instead of making fun of us, they should do something better with the concept of love yourself that is so necessary these days
they feel a lot more at peace. fast forward to LY era aka the most life-changing one for all of us, enter a video about the achievements of BTS (especially namjoon’s speech in the UN) then enter the boy/girl who’s grown to be their best version of themselves.+
Then have the camera pans to the fangirls watching BTS’ UN speech, as Namjoon say “No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself. Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.”
Like are they planning to work with UNICEF again? How did it feel to have a speech at the UN and meeting such political figures? What other charities are they planning to help out if any? Just there is a multitude of questions you can ask @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/relijoon/status/1116009003128115201 …
When @Smeraldo_Books opened the acc, I was just 1 month years old ARMY who only have a thought of BTS that was the only K-Pop who campaign the importance of love yourself, have a speech at UN, doing great musics, stunning dance and aesthetically pleasing MV. THAT'S ALL & WRONG.
Since @BTS_twt is back in NYC! Let’s bring back Joon’s iconic UN speech from last year!!! #WelcomeBackBTSpic.twitter.com/vh9rKbNs2F
typical for non fans in this country Now since most of those coworkers are my fb friends, I had the urge to share BTS’ UN speech this morning and guess what??? +
Why are they telling him to go away? We love sharing @BTS_twt music & telling others about the good they do. Their inspirational words, such as their speech at the UN. There's been jokes about the #ARMY being a cult, would have been funnier to run that bit ¯\(ツ)/¯ #SNL @nbcsnlpic.twitter.com/6f936y6n5O
Late thought, is Jungkook practicing the UN speech in the BTS Episode of the Grammys?
Bts UN speech BTs Grammy museum interview ARMYS charity works These are few examples of how to override that ...not this skit And they didn’t lie ...the skit is also a fangirl representation, there will be other platforms to show the other representations ..not a comedy show
this reminds me of the time the girl giving an introduction to bts before their speech at the UN said sumn along the lines of “i know there’s a bunch of fangirls watching right now” like girl.... this is UNITED NATION not a concert nd how are u gonna generalize us to one gender..
You can watch RM's UN speech here. https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1044332150378524672?s=20 …
Click the link and read the lyrics. BTS has proved time and time again that they support racial minorities. Look at the UN speech, look at their ending-ments, look at how they removed KOREAN words in songs because they sound like slurs. Childhood ignorance ≠ hate
namjoon didn't make a UN speech saying "no matter your skin color, your gender identity" for SNL to depict bts' fans as 90% cis white girls, can western media just realize that we don't fit in the stereotype and narrative they're trying to push?

Their album Map of the Soul Persona & RM's UN's speech emphasizes the importance of understanding the self, the human psyche in order to love ourselves. How does Carl Jung's work influenced them as artists and as individuals? Do they know that a lot of Jungian analysts
Ask them if they are proud of creating a worldwide movement for self acceptance: "No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself." --Namjoon in his UN speech P.S. Please tell them we think their English is perfect.
The UN speech led me to this interview & I followed on JF on Twitter so obviously I was going to watch it. Here I am months later, couch potatoed on BTS vids, pre-ordered #Persona and booked for a 3rd @BTS_twt concert. Talented, charming, humble, funny OT7 - what’s not to love?

https://youtu.be/Te5KZjtdqdw Ok but I just listened to it again because I recommended it to you. And I though abt the UN speech. And Whalien. And now I'm crying on my Chem book. Great. It's really gorgeous. And RM is the most amazing man, no one can change my mind.
namjoon's un speech is literally what made me fall in love w bts
Watch SNL create a sketch about Namjoon and BTS UN speech #BTSxSNL #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/hxcVXPgNnz
i remember psy but the show Lucifer played shinee's Lucifer so i wanted to know more about the song. I fell into the kpop rabbit hole after that, so i was a fan but still afraid of the toxicity of being an ARMY. The un speech changed that and I've been ARMY for 5 months now.
IDK but everytime bighit releases episodes of BTS attending the BBMAs,AMAs,UN Speech,and Grammys,I just can't hold myself from crying..They really went this far. I'm so f proud of them

said bts plagurized their songs and they had a lot of hate and barely any money and they didnt think they’d make it but now they did! but the messages they choose to share through music is so empowering like you should watch namjoon’s un speech! it brought me to tears they’re
Has 5 Guinness World Records? BTS. Made a speech in UN? BTS. Had 2.6M pre-orders on the new album? BTS. Paved the way? BTS. Legends? BTS. NO ONE IS DOING IT LIKE BTS. BTS ARE THE TRUE KINGS OF KPOP
https://twitter.com/ebonysapphire/status/1113504179396464641?s=21 … oh ok so now y’all want to act dumb, let’s not act like BTS ain’t say that love isn’t just between a woman or man or how they have shown support to lgbt artist and gave them jobs also let’s not act like BTS don’t make general neutral songs watch UN SPEECH
Ow no they have a male hair dresser since last year I remember for the UN speech or much more then that
Blaming without truth doesn't make you and sb who tried to accused Thai ARMY pretty too. ARMY IS ARMY. If you want to seperate nationality, It depends on you. BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE BTS PLS, LISTEN TO RM SPEECH AT UN AND THINK ABOUT IT
My parents just came back from China for business and my mom bought me BTS stuff. This never happened before, like buying merch for me. She said coz i love them so much and she also like them too since the UN speech (also she cried after read epiphany lyric). Awww pic.twitter.com/kKJgSyCdsR
I was wrong cuz I thought this was bts at their UN speech but it was the Grammys
No I was wrong cuz I thought this was bts at their UN speech but it was the Grammys
I love being an ARMY and one of the reasons that I do what I can is because I know @BTS_twt uses their influence for good. I had my students watch their UN speech because I wanted them to see that they were more than an idol group. #BTSThisIsWhypic.twitter.com/27d0Xh7W8h
i wonder why they choose images that have dark meanings and tell us really nice and sound things like what #RM said in the UN speech its so conflicting @BTS_twt they look at us army in a sarcastic way but tell us we are nice and they are grateful
For a class project where we needed to choose inspirational people I delivered Namjoon's speech at the UN and i spoke about BTS in class I have got 20/20 haha can't wait for your comeback #MapOfTheSoulPersona #ThankYouBTS
Irl: so bts- Me:YES THEY'RE AMAZING THEY'RE MUSIC HAS TOUCHED SO MANY PEOPLES LIVES DID YOU HEAR THEIR UN SPEECH YOI /HAVE/ TO GIVE THEM A LISTEN YOU /WILL NOT/ REGRET IT THEY'RE LITERALLY KINGS OF EVERYTHING
Well I felt broken and deppresed then I listened to RM's UN assembly speech, something happened it kinda brought back life in Mee , i listened all the songs love yourself albums and I feel better and yeah I was able to study then, BTS u guys really make us feel better thank u

OH MY GOD I totally thought this was BTS on their way to the UN speech I AM SO DUMB
This a Korean translation of an interview with Murray Stein, the author of Jung's map of the soul , where he talks about Jungian theories, BTS and ARMYs, and Namjoon's speech at the UN. It's as much fascinating to him as it is for us https://twitter.com/jungianLaura/status/1115608214177964032 …
he has done such good research. he has watched BTS' UN speech and in this video they're reviewing the lyrics of Namjoon's intro Persona. He has even watched DKDK TV's explanation of the song. my heart is full
They are showing their support through their actions, what do you think they doing when they are working with lgbtq artists or supporting their work? didn't you listen to namjoon's speech at un? jhope's speech at mama awards? they never fail to include people+
The only victims here are the ones who lost the ability to think and judge things objectively because they are hypnotized into believing they cannot live if they don't obsess about someone else. UN speech is a great thing, but it's still PR and they are just smoke and mirrors.
You’re making yourself the victim, which is a big no, since you mocked someone’s hard work and undermined it as a speech for popularity. The UN isn’t a joke, and don’t accept anyone to speak. It’s saddening that you can’t accept someone’s hardwork because they’re kpop idols.
First of all armys have nothing to do with this. But that youtube insinuated they were r@cist on the fact that they wore sunscreen, made xenophobic comments about joon's UN speech and continuously made baseless, problematic accusations on bts purely for clout
The BTS UN speech used to be the soundtrack of my life. My morning spirit. The thing that kept me going. Now I cry listening to it. It’s so beautiful. SPEAK YOUR TRUTH GUYS
can I include some lines from your UN speech, namjoon? please @BTS_twt
i hated the way i looked. i thought i wasn’t worth the fight, i thought i didn’t deserve love. but after Namjoon’s speech at the UN, i started to realize how much i actually mattered. i rediscovered my love for music and dancing, i rediscovered the love i had within myself
the fact that I’m doing my informative speech for my public speaking class on BTS and the impact they’ve had on the government + the UN speech, my MIND !
My mother threatened to tweet bts because I showed her the UN speech and RM made her cry. Now I have a 68 year old mother in love with a boy band.
Me: Wow yes BTS’ speech at the UN was inspiring. These are 7 very humble and mature young men who will empower many people and take over the world. Their hard work and dedication shows entirely. @BTS_twt: https://twitter.com/taehyungthugg/status/1053659080731041793/video/1 …

Don't forget his UN speech! He specifically included "gender identity" in it.
Also yeah, I was hoping for the UN speech, but maybe next time! #PersonaTracklist #3DaysToMapOfTheSoul @BTS_twt

#MyLoveYourselfJourney UN speech that RM gave in 2018. What strikes me the most out of his speech was remembering our roots & forgiving our mistake because they were part of our constellations. I haven't truly love myself fully,but sure I will reach there one day. @BTS_twt
never forget that one time my mom asked me "have u seen bts' speech in the un" nd i was like "yeah, have u" and she said "no lmao idek those people why would i listen to their speech" . i was about to throw hands at My Own Mom

@BTS_twt You're the most sweetest person ever, I will cherish your letter for as long as the letter is alive, I dont know how it feels like to get a letter so I wanna try and I know your words will be as great as Namjoons UN speech so lets get it!
Speech to UN by RM from BTS
Why are you hiding the tracklist bh? Intro: Persona Boy with Love Hero Skit: UN Speech Dream (this could be a song for Army) Outro/Interlude: Speak Yourself #BoyWithLuv @BTS_twt
At first you were using the UN audience against BTS, now you call them “robot” lol Oh please, now I totally get why you think their music and speech is nothing. You clearly dont know intellectual.
Honey how would you know that? Your fave is nowhere near UN invite. Hence you sure didnt catch how the people there actually showed genuine interest to BTS. See Jimmy Fallon speaking only the truth here. And yes, simple but poweful speech was delivered pic.twitter.com/joVfR16Ksy
Watch @BTS_twt #RM UN speech here: https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Fyi, the groundwork for Halsey's music is also her personal experiences & struggles with mental health which she is a huge advocate of. She also delivered a powerful speech for the #MeToo movement last year, the same year when @BTS_twt went to the UN. #BoyWithLuv #BTSxHALSEY
I can hopefulluly relate on June 1. This past wed. I performed my graduation speech for my HS's council. Ive always wanted to speak at my graduation & after RMs UN speech i really pushed myself to do it. Im proud of my performance & thats all i could ask for.
Stan intellectuals. Crackheads. Biggest boy group in the planet. Stan the first Korean group to have a speech in the UN. First Korean group EVER. Marami eh. Di kasya. Hahaha. Lezzgeddit, @BTS_twt #BoyWithLuv
i’m so sad about love yourself tour ending because we had so much fun? feelings? overwhelming happiness and love ? like UN speech making armys share their stories about being stronger people bc of bts or when citifield happened and we were all crying bc of this milestone together
#LYTOUR was so special to me. I always hate myself. This era, the UN speech, BBMA performance & a bunch of daesungs were just mesmerizing. It was during a period when I found difficulty in living a day or another. TY @BTS_twt
BTS WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS AND COMPOSE THEM WHILE BP DOES NOT..AND FANS STATE THEY R INSPIRED BY THE LYRICS EVEN THEY SAID ON THEIR UN SPEECH THATS A FACT BTS PUTS THE BIGGEST EFFORT ON THEIR SONGS FEW ARTISTS COMPOSE AND WRITE BTS IS ONE OF THEM
Tbh this is like an official claim that bts supports the lgbt community. The speech at UN (i still shed tears) And now THIS COLLAB WITH HALSEY I stan the right men. IF anyone even DARES to come at them or say anything about them I'm gonna fucking fight #PERSONAteaser1 #BoyWithLuv

This era will always be special. This era has saved many people, this era has given our boys many valuable things - grammy, un speech. In this era bts themselves have overcome their rainstorms. Armys are able to fight their ghosts bcs of this era.This era has saved me
Tear release, BTS’s daesang win and Jin’s emotional speech, UN speech, Hope World release
what if this time as a skit we are going to have bts speech at the UN???
I always believed you guys and I will always too. @BTS_twt namjoonah you are the greatest person that I have ever seen. You have so many responsibilities and seeing you doing everything perfectly, I was so amazed. Your UN speech and the things you always telling us will always +
Start promoting BTS on your local social media accounts! You can: - Post their viral videos on your FB My Day - Use their lyrics as photo caption - Post about the UN speech and Unicef projects - Use their songs as bgm to your tiktok vids It's time to create more ARMY!
For me BTS is the lighthouse in the dark stormy seas of self doubt, self hatred, depression, negativity..I found BTS after your UN speech &have not regretted a moment since then..you said "Love Yourselves" & I say "loving ourselves is loving you"..it's just the way it is
My niece was a fan and hv heard abt @BTS_twt. I got curious abt their music right after RMs UN speech and since hv become a solid #ARMYNOONA

No jdjssj I knew about loonarmys after stanning bts I got interested in them after their UN speech and when I read they tell a story with their MVs too I was like oh worm? So I checked their music and I was very impressed lmao
Finished!! RM, BTS’ fandom president. Thank you for being an inspiration to me, like the rest of BTS. He’s shown me what leadership means and how to SPEAK YOURSELF through his UN speech. He writes the most beautiful, profound lyrics.
i hope that the Skit is the UN speech
do they know about all the good bts has done for the world? the love myself campaign? the un speech? the meaningful lyrics? nah they just focus on the negative that they've literally apologized for. do good & no one bats an eye, make a couple mistakes & you're cancelled for good.
even after the UN speech how can some1 be dumb enough to think (or to want) BTS to be homophobes ?? and imply it’s bc theyre korean??? i want to smack a het ..
girl they're breaking the korean standards??? i mean do you stan them or?? the whole concept is LOVE MYSELF and they're so supportive since their debut, how can you say that? did u watched the UN speech? Did you see their concept photos?
I will actually cry if namjoon finds my terrible edit of my sticking his UN speech on the wall but at the same time I wanna tag @BTS_twt
i wouldnt say bts is as bad as everyone thinks at english cause they act like rm doesnt exsist whos fully fluent and even made a speech at the un... and he still doesnt know english? thats doesnt make sense
I wish you talk about their speech at UN. Thats the most breaking moment for them for last year aside landing the cover for TIME magazine for next generation leader. Also about how impactful and inspiring they are as musicians/artists for their fans. But thanks for the article.

Wow lol bts donation is not even half of what exo has donated to the less fortunate do your research hun you can not stand and make a speech in UN a world peace organazation if you did nothing
Watching the UN speech again wasn't a good idea lmaoooooooo I love @BTS_twt so much
From all achievements BTS had and they had many still UN and Joon's speech is by far my favorite one. That's when I said "my boys made it" that's when the world got to know their voice and their story.
BTS: Grammy nominated album, 2nd best selling artist 2018, 2 #1 bb200, sold out stadiums, time magazine, UN speech, biggest boy and in the world Other group: youtube views
who is doing it like BTS??? first korean act to be at billboard win an award, be at the grammys, have a speech at the UN, sell out stadiums across the US, be on late night and day time talk shows?? but yet you still wanna compare to other groups JUST BECAUSE THEYRE ALSO KOREAN...
I have a bts journal and in it I’ve been writing down bts’ major achievements since un speech and as I was writing down some I remembered joon said armys have a motherly love for them and please they’re our babies:( I’m really over here so proud as I write down everything:(
remember when bts were on the cover of time magazine and were called the next generation leaders, attended the UN for unicef and namjoon gave a speech, were awarded with the cultural merit award being south korea’s pride, and when they attended the grammys?
This is a year ago look at our boys now. UN Speech. Grammys. Stadium Tour. 2 Nominations in BBMAs. Dont you just feel soooo proud? This interview was also very respectful. Thank You Radio1. #BTSBillboardTopGroup @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oRSVrtKph_k
Fam, think back to all the times @BTS_twt made global headlines since the last CB - the UN speech, IFPI charts, Citifield, World Stadium Tour (to name a few). Can you imagine the number of new ARMYs and curious locals joining us this CB?

“BTS are plastics, you can’t throw them into the ocean. Imagine the pollution.” Plastic huh? A bunch of plastics that talk about mental health issues and how it is a taboo topic. A bunch of plastics that gave speech in the UN about youth. Outsold your fuvked up criminals.
Does ur fave had been invited to GRAMMY ? Gave a speech at UN ? And the president of South Korea said thank you to them ? No ? well BTS did : THAT. Then that means they PAVED THE FCKN WAY! NOW SHUT UP AND SAY “THANK YOU BTS”!!
Thank you @BTS_twt for contributing to my doing the exams well today. Your music and your speech at the UN helped me be more motivated and enthusiastic about writing my exam... So thank you
i had to write an essay about a speech and i wrote about bts’ un speech. i ended up writing about their achievements and everything instead of the actual topic, but i can’t help but be proud of them.

"y'all are going to wish you had a BBMA" no, ARMYs are fine aith all of BTS's daesangs, UN speech, BBMAs and AMAs performance, RIAA certifications, Cultural medal, #1 Billboard 200, sold out tours and stadiums, Grammy nomination, i'll pass this onto kpoppies
so it took bts multiple records, a un speech, a grammy invite and music bbma nom for their distributor to acknowledge them
I think its time to remind yall that @BTS_twt went to the grammys, gave a speech at UN, will appear on SNL, are nominated for #BTSBillboardTopGroup and #BTSBillboardTopSocialArtist at the #BBMAs Also #BTS paved the way.
BTS are Korean artists musicians they go beyond that please show your respect cuz not any K-Pop group has made a speech at the UN BTS isn't just a K-Pop group the Korean artist and ambassadors of the Korean culture show them some respect

I hope for the comeback ARMY really comes in full force. It’s been a long 7.5 months since Answer and so much has happened from the UN to that MAMA speech to the Grammys so I hope y’all put your all for them just as BTS have for us. Remember, It’s a marathon not a sprint.

*Why are you so mad though? Yes, it got in my head, and music awards too , preorder stats, sold out stadiums, cultural merit award, grammys nom, UN speech, etc. BTS paved the way. I don't need to be mad. BTS will win this and speak for themselves. BTS PAVED THE WAY.
Thank you 4 ur kind & understanding words. Given the content of @BTS_twt music & the values they share, eg during #RM's UN speech, it pains my heart when I see so many "fans" joining in ongoing targeted harrassment. It's not only cruel, but it hurts #BTS & #ARMY's reputation.
since ppl been downplaying everything from grammys to UN speech. stan bts.
To practice for my English AP exam imma do a whole rhetorical analysis essay on BTS’s UN speech.
this kind of feeling again! im nervous ! it happened during AMAs nominations, GRAMMYs and UN speech .. I can't calm lol @BTS_twt

so I just tried writing Joon's speech at the UN, I thought a little and boom .... !!! this is a lot and it's impossible if you have to memorize it in a flash!!! Waw...I don't know how Joon can do it but he's a smart guy that's why i love him @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nnrlAujVIz
I AGREE THIS IS WHY WE FOUGHT FOR THEM TO COME Canada is literally the LAND OF BTS and that's why HAMILTON WAS THE BEST MOMENT OF THE TOUR THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE UN SPEECH
Yeah, part of me wishes I told that older man about the UN & to look up the speech totally slipped my mind till afterwards...
Soo.. My prof picked me to be a representative for my class for a speech competition. "Imitate a famous speaker" so allowed me to use your un's speech namjoon @BTS_twt ahh what did i get myself into pic.twitter.com/ZONgfnUrnN
I am still in shock about Namjoon working on all of the albums, mono, the UN speech and carrying so much of the US press tour's weight last year, and yet, he was still calling himself lazy at the end of the year @BTS_twt
IDOL last September. I saw the news bout them beating TS's record at the same time as the UN speech. I was not too keen about the expolosion of colors (1st full length K music MV watched). Explored YT a bit & found Spring Day. It was what I needed to hear the most.
finally listened to the podcast with the author of map of the soul and please listen to it if you haven't, it was almost uncanny how stein got bts so well just by watching their UN speech and them choosing to incorporate his book to the album https://speakingofjung.com/podcast/2019/3/25/episode-42-jungs-map-of-the-soul …
Joonie asking himself if he deserves giving the speeh at UN :( He's so humble... of course you deserve it baby, you're such an inspiring person... thanks for existing #RM @BTS_twt [Eng Sub] 180923 RM Vlog before UN speech (BTS 방탄소년단) https://youtu.be/Vq6jzkX9pOE
I remember the night before BTS’ UN speech & even an hour before I was so nervous and I wasn’t even giving the speech. I knew they’d do great 100% and I am still so damn proud of them. The way in Namjoon’s log he was nervous but kept positive, he did amazing I love him so much :(
Why I always say the UN speech is when I got into @BTS_twt #rm #namjoonistoopreciousforarmys #btsunicefhttps://twitter.com/cafe_army/status/1113538409585348613 …
What a touching letter. Thanks for sharing. His UN speech was so moving and deeply affected me.
Namjoon: “They (fans) made seven of us stand here even here at UN assembly as the representative. We are speaking on behalf of them that’s all.” You worked hard and made a historical speech. So proud of you and we love you Joonie! @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/UOSRIuSenI4 pic.twitter.com/14a6KpjmbB
Thank you unnie oh!! So I applied yesterday to be a student speaker for my commencement and my speech was inspired by Namjoon’s UN speech so i hope I get chosen to speak about my story and BTS
i think their bts begins concert 1st #1 on a music show 1st daesang 1st gymnastic standium concert un speech n mma 2018 are the moments i cried the most for them....
I remember feeling so sad about leaving hamilton and bts after the concerts, but seeing them glowing at the un the very next day and hearing joon’s speech made me feel so much better
Long but inspiring thread: In September when @BTS_twt made a speech at the UN, I can’t really describe how much inspired I was. I kept thinking about it and felt amazed by the achievement and opportunities that the life offers. I even messaged my sister about it —- pic.twitter.com/5jtxMY6KHQ
Ok, so I just re-watched the RMs UN speech and I remember this !! Joon keep asking about out names and what move and inspire us &, after started loving ourselves, find & learn to use our voice .. So MOTS is a way to fund that & start Speaking for ourselves, to collect our parts
so in my speech class i'm supposed to give a soeech on how we can make the world a better place and naturally of course i'm going to be talking about how we should start with loving ourselves and quoting my king namjoon and the rest of bts for the albums/his un speech
Such an inspiring speech. This makes me wanna go watch their un Bangtan bomb.

The whiplash between seeing @bts_twt on a Sunday evening for the Love Yourself tour and then seeing Namjoon give the UN speech the next day at noon. I thought it was a whirlwind for me, but it was so much harder for them. I will never take whatever they give to ARMY for granted.
The UN Speech's influence is there! Every Where! (here on Twitter, every day!) @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/Simone84527723/status/1113487982852546561 …
Oops meant to reply to you. Here it is Yes, I was at the concert that day. Oblivious to the fact that the UN speech was the next day!!
Wonderful thank you! #WednesdayWisdom @BTS_twt #RM speech at the @UN is forever embedded in my soul along with this one. #ENDviolence #UNICEF #BTSKOREAPRIDE Thank you @choi_bts2 for bringing it up. https://twitter.com/choi_bts2/status/1100365848449974272?s=21 …
BTS's influence on the active participation of youth in society (I talked about the speech at the UN, the love myself campaign and things like that). At the end the teacher even clapped so I was really happy about this presentation. A few days ago I got the grade of the English
Thanks for the translation! I love this! A line that jumped out at me was: "I would like to become that person who will inspire with more positive thoughts." I am amazed by how that has been my exact experience since I began following @BTS_twt (& #Namjoon's UN speech was a key).

My daughter and I were at the same concert too and I’m still amazed he was preparing for the concert and UN speech at the same time! Then practiced the UN speech more after the concert! I was exhausted just watching them perform! @BTS_twt
Yes, I was at the concert that day. Oblivious to the fact that the UN speech was the next day!!

Can bighit pls release the footage of BTS' reaction when they learned theyre going to go to UN and givin a speech
#DearNamjoon Today I saw your UN speech again. You said music has been your sanctuary when you were struggling to fit it. I hope you know that you, your music, and @BTS_twt, are the sanctuary of ARMYs all over the world. Thank you, KNJ, our dear leader. We love you. pic.twitter.com/tglPfUzl7k
imo BTS going to the UN + Namjoon giving a speech there is such an underrated achievement of theirs. It's something theirs only. This achievement is finally something that doesnt give focus on us or their fans. It's about them only. It's about their impact as musicians and people
Namjoon you are influential to me I think about the UN speech esp the part about our past mistakes a lot, to me and I’m sure many other ARMYs you are doing really really well love you good luck for the comeback @BTS_twt
Whenever I introduce BTS to non-fans and curious friends, I make sure to mention about their UN Speech. It's part of BTS identity already because they made history - whether you like that fact or not. https://twitter.com/choi_bts2/status/1113403971593428998 …
i told a teacher about me going to a bts concert, and she was really interested. i told her about how much they help people and the impact they have ect, i spoke about the un speech, as well as unicef and she told me she’d check them out i felt so proud
joon, the leader of bts, has an amazing mind to influence many to be a better person by his UN speech, so genuine and sincere. i decided to love him forever https://twitter.com/choi_bts2/status/1113403971593428998 …
Joonie worked so incredibly hard and deserves so much respect for the things he does... :( I am so so proud of him, words will never be enough to express how much... a full shedule before he gave the UN speech but he did a wonderful job & affected so many lives :') @BTS_twt
Early this day, I watched again the UN Speech of Namjoon and it made me really emotional again and feel proud of him, of BTS as always Then they uploaded his log talking about the speech. The timing though.
namjoon’s vlog was the same day as my 2nd bts show omg :( I keep forgetting it was the day before the UN speech
They were doing shows, his throat hurt, had UN speech the day after. Can’t imagine how stressful those days must have been for him BTS show us their emotions but they don’t let the bad energy overtake. Always be positive, no matter what & you’ll succeed pic.twitter.com/F0mU198YI1
He was a little down bc of his throat, he wanted to be well enough for the UN speech
There's a new @BTS_twt log. Go check it out! It takes place a day before his iconic and important UN speech so show RM your usual love and a little bit more this time. http://youtu.be/UOSRIuSenI4
He really did.... he said they had a concert that day and that his voice wasn’t well... and after the concert- they’d fly to the US for the UN speech, he would only have 4 hours of sleep :( I really hope he’s less exhausted now but considering it’s comeback time, probably not
Sending lots of hugs to this babie You have no idea how proud we are of you for making that UN speech. You moved and inspired us so much through your words.

Thank you so much for translating!! I loved his UN speech, so I'm glad to see a little bit more of his thoughts about it. @BTS_twt #RM
I had no idea the boys so much going on around the UN speech, and being the one who gave the speech, Namjoon had a bit more on his plate. I applaud him for his stamina and work ethic. @BTS_twt #RM
Namjoon worked really hard on the UN speech he looks so tired in this video Joon don't worry the Speech is amazing and so inspiring @BTS_twt #thankyouNamjoon #thankyouBtshttps://youtu.be/UOSRIuSenI4
Seriously namjoon's speech at the un have helped me a lot. I used his speech to speak for myself at school & to my parents who didn't know what I really was going through. I was able to realize I can love myself too. I wanna thank Namjoon for delivering his message. @BTS_twt

remember when bts was flying to ny for the un speech and jungkook got the recliner seat but he switched with namjoon to make sure he slept well,, jungkook really is namjoon’s biggest fan :’)
So I submitted my commencement speech proposal to the commencement speak committee. I hope I get chosen because it would be great to share my story. The structure of this speech was inspired by Namjoon’s UN speech. I sprinkled BTS into it. I had to! Lol

An error was made, an apology given, an article rewritten, the original removed, & new one published. Do u remember what RM said in his UN speech? The lessons BTS shares? I hope no 1 treats u the way u r treating this writer. I hope ur mistakes r met w understanding & forgiveness
Y’all haven’t seen me yet I’m prolly the ugliest person alive on this planet. Namjoon: i released the whole love yourself series and talked about loving yourself so many times, even in the UN speech and you still do this to me. *questions all life decisions*
in one of my lessons we had to help our teacher make this chart for a school exhibition we're having and she needed a quote to write on it and i spent a solid 5 minutes trying to convince her to use a line from bts's un speech and she said she'll think abt it lets get this bread
The first time I cried was while watching bon voyage S3( when taetae cried because of grandparent's death). 2nd was while listening to RM's UN speech (live broadcast) because I was so proud of them. And the 3rd time was because of bts' speech at mma 2018.
@BTS_twt is it okay if I wrote a paper based on your speech in the UN?
Sir, I enjoyed your video discussing Namjoon’s speech at the UN. I’m looking forward to digging in deeper with more of your videos as well as reading Dr. Stein’s “Jung’s Map of the Soul” once it arrives. Thank you for assisting Namjoon & BTS with broadening our horizons.

In conclusion, kpoppies who dissed joon’s UN speech can ch*ke. This man who has spent 30 years of his life studying the work of Carl Jung is getting excited over BTS, their new album, Joon, and is calling Joon’s speech “phenomenal.” we been knew his speech was legendary
I really wanted to add more, but I didn’t want to exceed the 650 words! It’s so hard condensing @BTS_twt into just a one page 650 word essay!!! I could just go on and on and on about them! But I mentioned the un speech and the LM EndViolence campaign so...
Wow. I love this song. Is it called.. "Skit: UN Speech"? @BTS_twt

My Prof was so excited when I've told him that BTS used demian by Herman hasse as reference for their song. He emailed me few days ago saying that he's heard of Mots. He's been keeping his eyes on BTS after the UN speech too
I'm listening to Dr Stein's podcast with @JungianLaura. Interesting how Namjoon, in his speech at the UN, kept the distinction between his persona (RM of BTS) and his core self (Kim Namjoon, a boy who grew up outside of Seoul)

If only @BTS_twt can really create a remix of their UN speech like what they did with bb speech, I'd gladly replay it always.
Your just jealous that’s bts has gone to the grammys, has released so much music in the past 2 years. black pink has like 4 songs. They wrote a speech for the UN and reach out their fans to love themselves and have changed lives while BP hasn’t. BP bows to our kings
Since Persona will be BTS’s 6th EP i am hoping that the Skit will be Namjoon’s UN Speech
Actually thats impossible since your girls will never be making a speech at the UN and you dont understand how important that is cuz no group has ever made a speech at the UN besides BTS your girls dont even understand that theres more to the world than them and they are selfish
And amazing fan translators! Anyway, this is the end of my long rant. I'm adding a photo of @BTS_twt and the link to their UN speech to maybe inspire people. https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y pic.twitter.com/dzQuBfHTEU
Don’t just tell me that I am obssesed over Korean boys that don’t know I exist. @BTS_twt helped me a lot in my journey to the finish line. Their songs, Namjoon’s UN speech, their bts eps, all made me smile and laugh in the midst of my sadness https://twitter.com/ddaengcypherhoe/status/1112742962738298880 …
Well you are assuming what bts are here for un speech. So how is thay feel gurl?
Omg this needs to blow up. Thankyou and bts indeed respect everyone no matter what their religion, caste, gender identity is. Here's the clip of RM's(BTS' leader) speech at the UN(its upto you but i'd suggest you to look a look at this): https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
the un invited bts to give a speech that is aimed towards the generation of today. and this was a year ago, dammit. it helped thousands who couldn’t find themselves, had trouble with their identities; it helped people speak out on who they are. these two issues - palestine and—
Finally my 6 months with BTS I was only an orbit and I wasn't really interested in bts until they did the UN speech and I thought that well, if they went there and talked about their identity and are encouraging the youth to speak their voice, they might be onto sumn lmfao pic.twitter.com/Qn6MZgcyS2
some of yall idiots expect the most from bts who are musicians,,, MUSICIANS, not politics. they cant snap with their fingers and solve the world's problems like magicians lmao. stop invalidating bts' UN speech and involving politics or important issues to twt fanwars.
Am not even gonna censor. .its Sunmi getting backlashed for saying BTS paved the way, clc's cultural inappropriateness becoming an excuse to bring BTS's past mistakes and RM's UN speech being mocked.
@BTS_twt JOOOONIE I'M OFFICIALLY WRITING MY UNIVERSITY THESIS ABOUT YOUR UN SPEECH I'd be glad if you came to my graduation, just saying, you'd feel so proud. love you
You clearly know nothing about the UN. The GA adopted 6 peace resolutions just two months after namjoon’s speech. Even then, the conflict mainly falls within the UNSC, a whole different branch to the UNGA where he spoke. How dare u manipulate real world issues to hate on BTS. https://twitter.com/baekhole/status/1112345991808724993 …
Why would bts talk about Israel when their whole speech is about youth? You’re so obsessed with bts — This wasnt abt them talking about something else kt was abt UN not taking time to speak about other problem that are quite more… https://curiouscat.me/AvecBBH/post/832777054?t=1554111660 …

When did I start stanning @BTS_twt? #RM When I heard RM address the UN. I’ve been to Korea several times but I’ve never took any interest in K-Pop or BTS until I heard RM’s moving speech. It was raw, genuine and insightful and so I found myself down the rabbit hole of BTS. pic.twitter.com/BpOkM3x2l6
BTS: Talks about social issues, participated in Unicef campaign for youth, addressed to it in his UN speech, promote self love, self acceptance Antis, pulling that 'but' card: but Palestines? Anyways, do me a favor and report & block this headass https://twitter.com/baekhoIe?s=09
I dont know who it was bc my horrible depression brain didn't make sense of it until after I scrolled past and lost it, but BTS's UN speech was very important and shouldn't be devalued because the UN chose not to focus on other, more important issues. Don't like tweets
yeah people were saying their “love yourself” concept annoying, said they’re “selling their depression,” said their UN speech was unnecessary, etc. like sheesh but that’s just what happens whenever it’s bts they can’t stand em
It’s been 7 months since BTS’ speech at the UN and antis are still pressed, y’all stink
bts use their platform to share their stories & bring light to important issues that are commonly neglected & this stank ass kpopies dare to come for the UN speech while stanning irrelevant cloth hangers that interpret songs about het love and how physical good looking they are..
Same. Also report this person too..They're backing that person up who's dragging BTS' UN speech also.. https://twitter.com/vorewinwin
bts’ speech was 7 minutes out of the whole event which lasted 2 weeks as far as i know. the UN are already involved in palestine via UNRWA, so maybe try donating to them https://www.unrwa.org/
that is a PART of the UN assembly's discussion, that's why BTS was honored to deliver speech, this is why you should do ur proper research before u open ur mouth.
So why the fuck are you coming for bts when they got the chance to give a speech at the UN and reduce their impact to 0, when your fav hasn’t gotten the chance. applaud people for their effort to make a change that you yourself say your fav hasn’t gotten.
i literally just saw a tweet shitting on namjoon’s UN speech... it’s tiring bc u know its never actual criticism, they just dont like that its bts doing it
Bts - invited to the UN to give a speech and partners up with UN to protect women and children raised over 1 mil Exol - yeah but wat about Palestine Exo - who my dreads fit the concept in kokobop tho
Love Yourself is an album series which led BTS to join with Unicef for a campaign with the same name. A percentage of their album sales went towards the campaign as donations. It led BTS to get invited to the UN and deliver their UN speech.
remember when my licensed psychologist lecturer talks abt the importance of bts un speech in front of the class because depression is on the move to be one of the leading cause of death for youth
You think such a topic can be addressed in the 7 minutes RM made his speech? And this specific UN event was focused solely on the YOUTH. Why the fuck would they be discussing the Israel-Palestine crisis? Y’all niggas find fault in EVERYTHING BTS does. Bitter bitches.
I know I did not see a gg stann bringing the UN speech and saying why bts do not talk about palestine - Israel and the comments dragging namjoon speech
This bitterness and hypocrisy— the reasons on why BTS’ speech at the UN is important. Y’all don’t even know what their campaign is but ofc y’all go off SIMPLY because you dislike BTS. https://twitter.com/baekhole/status/1112345991808724993 …
Omg BTS NamJoon’s speech at the UN was so inspiring that it made me tear up
Rewatched their UN speech.. it made me realize that so many people in the world go through struggles and we don’t even know it. I’d like to use the #PersonaChallenge to not show glowups but to express how we’ve grown to love every aspect of ourselves. Pls share the BTS message. pic.twitter.com/D3NdofEJJb
HEY FAM CHECK THIS OUT Murray Stein an American Jungian Analysis talk about BTS new Album #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL & He also talk about BTS RM UN SPEECH & how it related related to the new album. Link:https://speakingofjung.com/podcast/2019/3/25/episode-42-jungs-map-of-the-soul … Now I have a little bit ideas on this new era. [ @BTS_twt ]
I wonder if they will do a skit on Persona of Namjoon's UN speech like they did for their acceptance speech at billboard music awards on Her @BTS_twt
I'm from Parañaque City owowowowo ♡ BTS has helped me to build and gain my confidence and self-esteem. I became more proud of myself. I used to think I was useless, worthless, and ugly. But after Joon's UN speech, I must say, I became a whole new person after.
I WAS BLASTING THE UN SPEECH AT FULL VOLUME LAST NIGHT AND PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN CRYING AND MY MOM TOLD ME SHE LIKES BTS AFTER HEARING THE SPEECH THEN EXACTLY AFTER THAT SOMEONE CALLED ME AND MY PHONE WENT OFF, MY RINGTONE WAS THE YANG YANG YANG IN BVS3
Y’all the gap is closing! We all know how much they have influenced the not only the music industry but society as a whole! Their speech at the UN! Their positive presence on media WORLD WIDE! They have influenced the whole world! @BTS_twt http://bit.ly/2FL3iTW pic.twitter.com/0TkanoQUE2

i cry when bts cries also during Namjoons UN speech
Speak Yourself (World Tour) In his UN speech, RM told his story and asked everyone to speak themselves no matter who they are or where they're from.
Kim Taehyung also known as “V” from “BTS”, a Kpop group that has recently taken the world by storm. Almost the entire world knows them lol. They gave a speech at the UN. Were nominated a Grammy. Billboard top social artists 2x. On the cover of Times magazine. Sold out stadium +
Today I suddenly remembered the day we got to know about @BTS_twt was going to the UN and Joon was going to give a speech. We all were so proud, so so proud. That was one of the best days ever And the day of the speech, we all were so nervous and happy
I’ve also never actually seen or heard the entire BTS UN speech... But I just did and almost teared up while doing so Maybe I should’be watched this speech earlier. Maybe then I wouldn’t have mistaked loving myself with greed. +
Yeah, I got teary eyed from the UN speech and Run BTS when they wrote those poems. For some reason the episode of BV when they wrote letters to themselves broke me - esp Namjoon's. Also MAMA'18, The Last and the LY highlight reel. I'm not an easy crier either lol
also the first ever korean act to even give a speech in the UN? not even american acts do this enough they just keep breaking barriers and of course now theres plenty of groups gaining attention but the one who broke the glass and gained respect here has been bts
First time watching this and no body no group is as wonderful as BTS when it comes to loving ourselves. They are so inspirational and remind us we do have a voice. It's time we used it to make a difference in the world! Nam-joon gave a wonderful speech. Lets take his words to .
My name is Lisa and I'm from Puerto Rico. I learned how to love myself through RM's UN speech and seeing that comparing myself with others isn't good for anyone and that I am my own person. Although I ACCEPT myself I'm still learning to LOVE myself. ++
When Jim was talking about bts disbanding, when joonie was making his speech at the un, and many more
At my office, I’m the youngest but even then outside of me talking about BTS, my co-workers will literally come up to me and mention that they saw BTS on the news or that they watched them on a talk show or saw their speech at the UN. Like nobody else in Korea is doing this.
Love yourself campaign and when I told her @BTS_twt is behind it, that they gave a speech in the UN, that they speak of mental issues, do philanthropy work, composes & produces their own songs, she’s excited to listen to them as soon as she gets off work+
Send him the UN speech. When RM talks about being a boy...it choked my husband up a bit. Reel him in.

joons verse in champion.. everytime i hear this line i get chills!!!! him n bts have done so much n have given a voice to the voiceless n created a platform for us all.. from the love yourself campaign to youth2030 speech @the un... In conclusion: i love namjoon + bts pic.twitter.com/EIZlmLQnWI

Guess who just watched Bts UN speech and cried in the middle of the night snsj @BTS_twt
Analyzing bts’ speech at the UN is harder throught tears
This is such a good article! It's so well explained. The connection to uhgood, the UN speech, their interviews and Carl Jung's theories... Really good, I enjoyed reading it. Thank you!
I don't see how anyone could hate that era as a whole when it really urged the fans to not just love BTS but to love ourselves. Even Jimin finally learned to love and accept him self during LY era. Like when the UN speech & epiphany dropped I CRIED. That era is so meaningful
i think you should show them clips like UN speech so your parents will have a mindset that BTS are inspirational etc
@BTS_twt @bts_bighit *Why BTS should be in the #TIME100 group: between their talents, record shattering year, awards won, charity contributions, important UN speech, their dedication/recognition/influence reaches far and wide. They earned their spot.* #BTSxFlorida #BTSinAtlanta

#RM possibly wrote #Persona thinking about the speech he gave to the @UN for the @bts_love_myself campaignpic.twitter.com/s51i4Hh60t
i wrote about his UN speech and how he said that people from every culture should learn how to be themselves and to love themselves, and i used his quote “find your name, find your voice, by speaking yourself”
I need UN speech as SKIT so that we can stream and chart it too @BTS_twt
i discover @BTS_twt through the students of my sister in-law i'm soo curious because they all talk about the members,and me sitting beside them listening there conversation about the UN speech.thats the start i search them in YT.and i like there songs already @BTS_twt
BTS RM UN speech! Full! https://youtu.be/M9Uy0opVF3s

It's like ㅠㅠㅠㅠ In his, UN speech, when he said speak yourself, and then in the concert when he asked us to use him and BTS to love ourselves, that resonates within me. Bangtan's music really makes me so at ease w myself which I've never been. It helps people accept
#MAP_OF_SOUL_PERSONA #PersonaChallenge @BTS_twt intro is inspired a lot by NamJoon’s UN speech! Here are some similarities I found 1.) Little NamJoon always dreamed of becoming a superhero pic.twitter.com/Po5b9PftGz
This line reminded me of when joon said this about his speech at the UN I just love how they use they’re infulence to speak on behalf of the youth I feel heard through them they’re truly next generation leaders :’) thank you @BTS_twt #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONApic.twitter.com/AMQOzJoPqk
That's so kind of you to say! I'm so I think we may have even seen more than those, actually, seeing as we got the whole back-to-school thing as well. Murray Stein mentioned Namjoon's UN speech several times in a recent podcast he was in, and especially the part where ++
my local friend really knows about bts bc he saw their UN speech i'm crying
Thank you for correction. Highly appreciated. Pls check out RM's inspirational UN speech. @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Hmmm. He could be sleeping that's y he's not responding. Tomorrow try to hang out with him until he opens up to u Wats been bothering him. N also make him watch BTS for example https://youtu.be/sMkRmnkI8kE part 1. After UN speech n the funniest BTS run
I LOVE @BTS_twt' MUSIC & I LOVE their MESSAGE! RM gave a speech @the UN last Sep & now his speech is used in schools. http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20181106000673 … BTS' official twt for their #BTSLoveMyself campaign in partnership w/ @UNICEF is @bts_love_myselfhttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1076405734097600512 …
Doesn't it remind you of the UN Speech. BTS (RM) gave us a voice. Being a voice for the voiceless and not forgetting Whalien 52.BTS is our voice, that hears our cry for help and gives us a platform to be heard. Their music is our comfort #MAP_OF_SOUL_PERSONA @bts_bighit @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/kbnlR8H0cp
For context, I’d like to add these tweets I made around the time of Love Yourself: Answer and BTS going to the UN - Namjoon’s Speak Yourself speech. https://twitter.com/94gustd/status/1044363499357405184?s=21 …
#MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA, @BigHitEnt , @BTS_twt, and #RM are unstoppable. They brought us back to Skool Luv Affair!! And tied in Jung's Persona theme and RM's UN speech
that was me! i thought of namjoon and i wrote about his un speech
Everybody was talking about the UN speech similarities, but I think even here there was some definite hinting going on. At the UN speech, during MAMA HK, and now in Persona, Namjoon is asking what makes us dream? #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/Brillante_0613/status/1073536748200779777/video/1 …
Namjoon does ask us in the persona intro to tell our stories... just like how he have been saying this since UN speech...im so excited for the rest of the album... something unusual and amazing is coming... I'm feeling this #Persona #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #BTS #RM @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xcSESf8aux
I also recommend the speech from Namjoon (the leader of BTS) at UN. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg … He talks indirectly about having different personas and also coming to terms with all these different personas.
I told her about Joon’s UN speech and she’s gonna watch it :’) Doing God’s work over here. #persona #BTSxUnitedNations @BTS_twt
The last one was honted at the UN speech
Human here, @BTS_twt fan/stan...mom...HR professional... if you get a chance also check out their UN Speech!
I think its a link to all of his previous stage names? Runch Randa Rap Monster RM ie all of them are R? Connecting to the idea that even our past selves are still us, like he mentioned in the UN speech
yeah yeah there’s was a part where he said something like “i was who i am in the past and who i am right now”(not the exact lyrics bc i forgot HHH) and reminded me of the UN speech
RM/Namjoon, leader, rapper of BTS. He writes songs with lyrics that connects to real life topics and are very socially aware. You can check his recent collab with Honne https://youtu.be/N5Y1ZSLNLjM If you’re interested you can also check his UN speech https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Just like Namjoon said in the UN Speech. He’s Kim Namjoon but also RM from BTS, an Idol and artist from ilsan, SK. Still just an ordinary 24 yr old. But now, who are we? He told us who he is and now he wants to know who we are.
Thank you for the correction. You should listen to @BTS_twt's music - so powerful and meaningful. Have you listened to their UN speech? #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y&t=230s …
@BTS_twt is a blessing and their words, messages, work and songs heal, keep amazing us! If you have already listened to "Persona", please watch their speech at the UN We are real and feeling more than alive thanks to them https://youtu.be/jMGEGAGymrg

Months later I found Kim Namjoon's eloquent UN speech. His moving message inspired me to try listening to #BTS again, this time full conscious so I could appreciate it fully. I was hooked and in love with their music.
Yes sir. I assure you we are authentic human beings. We’re just passionate fans of @BTS_twt who spread positive messages and we genuinely promote even unintentionally. You should look into them. Whether it’s their music or their positive messages like their UN speech
https://youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg … I hope you take a look at their latest @UN speech. They collaborated with them for a project for youth @_GenUnlimited. And #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA is based on the recent trailer for @BTS_twt comeback album https://youtu.be/M9Uy0opVF3s inspired by Carl Jung
Namjoon said in his UN speech that he used to dream of becoming a super hero and he said the same in his songMy Poor brain cells can't relate"Well just to let you know RM You've become a super hero and saved our lives and the music industry @BTS_twt #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONApic.twitter.com/BZvUdy0PxQ

Idk but today I just made my friend watch the UN speech and she told me she likes Namjoon and that he chooses the words so beautifully and that she is impressed by the message @BTS_twt gives to people.
@BTS_twt @bts_bighit 25/9/2018 Dear Namjoon, I just heard your speech at the UN. To say it touched my heart is an understatement. You were so nervous! But did so great, I'm very proud you guys are using your voices, platform and privileges to speak up about what is important.
@BTS_twt So is this how it feels like to hear Namjoon UN speech with beats? #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA

HIS UN SPEECH, AND AT THE ENDING, IT LOOKS LIKE HES PRETENDING TO DO IT, in his UN speech he also mentions he took a long time finding himseld or smthng, SOMETHING ABOHT WHO AM I, ARE YOU LIVING?
They gave us hints also in UN speech when RM spoke about his dream...They also give us hints everwhere... We should embrace our true self. Wow when I become an ARMY I didn't know I would do philosophy/psychology. @BTS_twt #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONApic.twitter.com/bTQgirBleW

OMG Just thinking about the theories is giving a headache !!! But I felt like he made a reference to his UN speech whan he said "tell me are your names" and was asking others if they think they are alive !! King is back #PERSONA #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA
The reference to the UN speech tho , really the new generations leaders @BTS_twt #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA
OUR PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSE. I fucking loved all the leader and “presidential” symbolism in the video I am SCREAMINg and he’s starting in a classroom like he did and BTS did and then he moves on to standing giving a speech and leading ala the UN ect ect it’s his journey too!!!!
The vibe is so awesome.... @BTS_twt has a new sound every comeback. Love the throwback and all the references to past eras, UN speech, etc. #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA
"so i'm askin' once again yeah. who the hell am i? tell me all your names baby. do you wanna die? oh do you wanna go? do you wanna fly? where's your soul? where's your dream? do you think you're alive?" .....his UN speech ohmygod #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #Persona @BTS_twt
Kim Namjoon everyone I'm so speachless... When I read the lyrics I directly thought about his speech at the UN. (This part ) #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA @BTS_twt #RMpic.twitter.com/0HkmLkEpfJ
I knew from the very first second Namjoon will make me question myself and my life all over again !! HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THAT HARD !! #Persona is , MV is full of meaning ... Did anyone have a UN speech flashback ?? #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #PersonaComebackTrailer @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/unGSdX0MQs
NGL THIS PART REMINDED ME OF HIS SPEECH AT THE UN AND IT GAVE ME CHILLS @BTS_twt #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #PersonaComebackTrailerpic.twitter.com/cedyqKw7oT
Yes, it's like his UN speech!! #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #Persona @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/shadow_twts/status/1110922250784571394 …
Hearing PERSONA is like hearing to Namjoon's UN speech again but with beats and sounds this time.... Am i the only one? #MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA #Persona @BTS_twt
it’s super old-school bts looking also that namjoon throwback performance from the award season and the UN speech omg they’re all related im literally so in love let’s go rapper king!!!!
I saw UN speech and then came to YT for MIC DROP @BTS_twt
The UN speech and experience: were the reactions back home what they expected? How are they handling the rise in popularity in S. Korea?
Murray Stein talks about JUNG'S map of the soul and about his thoughts on BTS's NamJoon (RM) UN speech. #BTS #RM #KimNamJoon #Namjoon #MaurryStein #MapOfTheSoulPersona #Jungsmapofthesoul #BTSARMY #April12 #MapOfTheSoul #MAP_OF_THE_SOULhttps://speakingofjung.com/podcast/2019/3/25/episode-42-jungs-map-of-the-soul …
So this is the intro that RM referred to in his UN speech. Wow I love this
This was the intro song he referred to in his UN speech pic.twitter.com/OO116Ez00x
okay but liSTEN bts included their FIRST speech when they FIRST won at BBMAs in LY: Her, the FIRST installment of the Love Yourself trilogy so there’s a possibility that their FIRST speech in UN or the Grammys will be in Persona?????
they literally gained more fans from just a meme video that has ddaeng as a bgm, many armys joined after UN speech - they can smile and they will get more fans so yeah bts doesn’t need shipping to gets popularity
I just watched Namjoon's speech at UN and oh my God..... I can't stop crying I love them so so so much and they have inspired me to be who I am and to love my self as I am which literally nobody else could do in 21 years @BTS_twt I love you and thank you for being here always pic.twitter.com/vg5bywZAbl
If BTS ain’t having ‘SKIT: UN SPEECH’ in their new album then what’s the point
I finished intensely challenging presentation I’ve worked on succesfully. I was greeted w/ so much praises that I’m smiling like a fool all day. The whole time I was feeling my nerve, I thought of RM & his UN speech. How brave he was. He kept me sane. I owe it all to @BTS_twt
She's just problematic. Her YouTube channel is sherliza Moe and she talked to some BTS saesangs including the no pants one. Criticised RM UN speech, called BTS overated and so on pic.twitter.com/qljsBjqzSs
I highly recommend this to you Fam ARMY & you can share this as well to your nonARMY friends. Dr. Murray shared how he knew about BTS & that he was moved by RM's speech at the UN.He explained what is persona & why we have multiple personas & why our shadow like envy or ego is++ https://twitter.com/jungianLaura/status/1110165503115448321 …
I have tried twice to explain to my parents why I love BTS. They feel happy that I feel motivated bc of their hard work but sometimes, they do find me weird. But they have never questioned or mocked me for following the boys. They actually paid attention to RM's speech at UN.
Manjoon at UN speech. This made me search then out. Then I realized 20 mins of BTS a day made my day much happier. After thousands of youtube hours, MV, Vlives, spotify, twitter gifs.... i can state this world of ours would be a much nicer one if everyone
my mom changed his mind (a little bit) about bts after the UN speech, my dad well he doesn't like that i listen to music at all mostly bc our religion. when it comes to buy merch well they sometimes give me money.
When I was introducing my mom to them, I played her the DNA dance practice video, followed by the MV and then I played the speech that Namjoon gave to the UN. Not a music video but it got my point across.

Personally I would love if they would add the "Speak Yourself" UN speech on their new album (or at least a part of the speech). Like imagine... "What is your name? Speak yourself!" ... *Transition to next song (maybe called "Speak Yourself"?* #MapOfTheSoulPERSONA #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/gzYdQeFSUd
I was seeing bts on my ig explore feed a lot, and idk which I saw first, but I either saw joon’s UN speech or a hoseok bapsae concert vid & saved it without knowing much about them akkdkdka
RM speech in UN
I'll ALWAYS retweet the UN speech. I'm so happy to know people still get inspired by it, like the first time we heard it. I remember that day, where I was, how I felt so vividly. You did so well @BTS_twt. https://twitter.com/fragmentidea/status/1110309564753342464 …
BTS Persona Tracklist: 1. Intro: Who Are You to you? 2. ARTIST 3 I'm Still Me 4.Dreaming 5. BOY WITH LOVE 6. Love and Power 7. Skit: UN Speech 8. AURORA 9. Outro: Persona (this is prediction) @bts_twt
Don't forget to watch their UN speech on #ENDVIOLENCE campaign
So fascinating! Def worth a listen for those interested in understanding Persona. @murraywsteinII so wise, researched @BTS_twt & connectd it to RM's UN speech. @jungianLaura asked great q's. Together they made such an engaging podcast. Thx for feeding my brain! #BTSxAHCxJUNGhttps://twitter.com/jungianLaura/status/1110165503115448321 …
54 days 20 hours and 5 minutes I had so much homework for one night I thought about the UN speech, MAMA in HK, + the Grammys and I never been so proud Please be well rested cuz I bet you all been having sleepless nights during the tour @BTS_twt #ARMY #BTSxMETLIFEpic.twitter.com/vEho8L1hKp
my mom doesn't care but my dad has the best character development we watched MAMA together and praised @BTS_twt performance he was like “these guys are crazy” and then my sister mentioned the UN speech, he was stunned. https://twitter.com/yourlovejk/status/1110152995667214336 …
I have shown V's live performance of and mv of Singularity. As well as RM's UN speech
I’d choose the UN speech or maybe pitchfork article but I don’t have link XD
The way stein complemented joon on his un speech it makes me so happy to know someone like him appreciates bts’s effort as much as we do
Skit: UN Speech as one of the tracks in Persona. I'M CALLING IT @BTS_twt
I mean yeah. If you listen to Namjoon’s speech at the UN summit, he touched on how he’s heard of all the stories that ARMYs have talked about :) and the responsibility he feels
Does it ever just hit you that bts were nominated for a Grammy and namjoon really gave a speech at the UN and received cultural merit awards and sold out stadiums ??!!?!!? And even bigger things are coming I’m so proud of them
First date. He say my koya pillow. I keep in my car since 1) I'm a bad driver just like my bias and Koya make me feel more confident in my driving. 2) Feels like Namjoon is with me. So I asked him if he knew who bts was.....he said "Yeah those guys who made that UN speech." pic.twitter.com/5In5JhphYy
Jenna’s the best love her she should see RM’s UN speech
[ #BTS ARTICLE] Dr. Murray Stein's spoke about @BTS in a recent Jung based podcast. He discussed his impressiveness with #RM’s UN Speech, becoming more familiar with ARMY, and about Jung’s vision reaching a new audience through BTS. https://www.elitedaily.com/p/dr-murray-steins-comments-about-bts-map-of-the-soul-persona-are-so-insightful-16983771 …
WE ARE WATCHING BTS' UN SPEECH IN MY HUMAN RIGHTS CLASSSSSS THIS IS NOT A JOKE OMG
Clearly Namjoon understood the concept of persona. Very evident in his UN speech. @BTS_twt
DR. STEIN shouted out RM for his AMAZING 'GENERATIONS UNLIMITED' SPEECH @the UN, which he says incorporated JUNGIAN THEMES. Considering this speech was made back in Sep 18, the level of care & effort @BTS_twt put into conceptualizing their albums becomes all the more IMPRESSIVE. https://twitter.com/Noelle_CD/status/1110311157678723073 …
Here is their UN speech that Mr. Stein refers to in the podcast https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
while I have you here... Generations React to BTS’ UN Speech???
Thank you!!! My husband has always been open minded when it comes to music, but I think what got him was the UN speech — it’s when he started really started paying attention. He loves how much joy @BTS_twt gives me so he’d play their music when at home and in the car...

So the true fact is they hate kpop....idk how to change their minds...maybe with the UN speech?
I don’t follow back multis cause i just want bts content and sometimes my opinions makes people uncomfortable and I don’t wanna make people uncomfortable and feels like they can’t break mutual Misu is the nickname Mishi gave me Pinned:UN speech @:my country, army, my nick name

++ Murray Stein theorizes a bit about why @BTS_twt chose Jung as inspiration, and yet again mentions the UN speech in which Namjoon alludes to the persona and social identity. Stein previously talked about how society's pressures and expectations can have a serious influence ++
Speaking of Jung - Episode 42 BTS' new album Map of the Soul: Persona as well as Namjoon's UN speech and more gets mentioned! @BTS_twt : https://speakingofjung.com/podcast/2019/3/25/episode-42-jungs-map-of-the-soul …
How did @bts_bighit come upon Jung's ideas for Persona album? Murray Stein is talking about Korean translation of Jung & wondering how BTS came in contact with #jungian thought. RM was talking about it in his speech to UN: persona is such a huge issue, to do with social identity.

++ It's not something we get from loved ones for free though. Like Namjoon of @BTS_twt said in his #GenUnlimited UN speech, it's constant work.
This reminded me of #RM during UN speech Accepting shadows, faults without approving them...self acceptance, love yourself and each other... #BTSxAHCxJUNG @BTS_twt
Looking forward to listening to this on my break. MENTIONED DURING THE INTERVIEW- Map Of The Soul: PERSONA Upcoming music CD by @BTS_twt available Apr. 12th, Jung’s Map of the Soul: An Introduction by Murray Stein, Ph.D., Full UN Speech by #RM of #BTS https://speakingofjung.com/podcast/2019/3/25/episode-42-jungs-map-of-the-soul …
What if he appears here explaining in a UN speech manner???
Dr. Stein just praised Namjoon’s UN speech for preserving the distinction between himself as a boy growing up and himself as a “star in the firmament of entertainment” and how he’s maintained contact with self and remained grounded. This is very good stuff! #BTSxAHCxJUNG @BTS_twt
Dr. Stein praised Namjoon words in his UN speech omg this is so important, both the interviewer and him are acknowledging BTS work and influence I'm very close to crying
Laura London gives a run-through of @BTS_twt, and mentions them being dubbed "Next Generation Leaders" by TIME. Both Laura London and Murray Stein express how impressed they are by how eloquent and thoughtful Namjoon is, and especially during his UN speech.
If we, our "self", consist of such a large number of parts – how do we not lose ourselves in it all? And without identifying with it? In response to this, Murray Stein says he was especially impressed by Kim Namjoon (RM) of @BTS_twt during his #GenUnlimited UN speech. ++
Thank you so much, Brian. And thank you for the link to BTS' speech at the UN
Check out @jungianLaura's podcast interviewing Dr. @murraywsteinII, the author of Jung's Map Of The Soul: Introduction.

Can we give more likes to BTS UN speech as well? @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
I remember I was in my bus from school going back home when I saw BTS trending in Twitter. I didn’t remember that in that day was the UN speech so I got goose bumps when I say it. I waited to be in my house to saw the speech cause I knew I was gonna cry
I was in bed ready to sleep but waiting for the UN speech. In the dark and w/ my earphones on, listened and just felt tears falling. @BTS_twt
Joon! I made script for group task and my friend said its awesome, but u know what? You help me to made it happen, I was inspired by ur speech at UN PBB when u said "these mistake makes the brightest constellation in my life'' and I always remember that. Thankyou so much!!
ok i'm so late but i just watched @BTS_twt UN Speech and wow i feel so inspired
I became an army the day I listened to his Un speech and spent the days after catching up all @BTS_twt so happy with no sleep
By descripts I mean, promo BTS like we do on twt. Mention their UN speech and that they write, compose, and produce. Talk about the social topics they cover in their music, and the genres they dabble in. Recommend songs, or offer enlightening quotes you’ve found in articles
a girl i knew tried to introduce me to bts in 2016 and i SLEPT on the dope mv she showed me. i texted her in dec 2018 apologising for my unlawful SIN. she recommended the UN speech, i watched it there and then. here’s my actual response h pic.twitter.com/HUklbj7dhr
after watching joons speech at the UN my dad fr loves bts and always asks me about what theyre doing lmaooo
Why Namjoon asked if our hearts beat in the concert ._. Even at UN speech he said what makes your heart beats .-. Is it a hint for what’s coming jooni? @BTS_twt
an end note; its really ironic to spread hate and negativity, when bts said love yourself and inspire others. we're all humans before we are fans and i can assure you, namjoon made a speech at the UN about this as a human being not as an idol. go educate yourself and grow up.
Retired attorney OT7 hooked by Namjoon’s UN speech thanks to my daughter & bias rap line but constantly wrecked by maknae antics... and truth untold JHope gets A LOT of my likes and retweets, right @yoongi__9304 ? #jhopepic.twitter.com/yZOUGhwWIW
No. I do not like Sherlize moe. Please don’t put any of her content on my TL. I understand that you can have an opinion, but she’s went past that & accused bts of being colorist, racist, and of plagiarism. She’s also accused NJs UN speech of being a ploy to keep fans.
i literally remember sitting in class and watching the un speech in so much shock that bts had been so inclusive and so loving and i remember just thinking like damn they are changing the world
about to use the bts UN speech as a source for this essay. alexa play ddaeng and lets get this grade

OMW.... i was a directioner ( I found about 1D in 2015) and in October 2018 I became army .. ( I found out about BTS cuz if there UN speech) Anyway Zayn and always reminded me of V! Idk why!! #army
my dad was clowning bts and said they weren’t doing anything good so I showed him their UN speech and he shut up https://twitter.com/TAEHYUNGTRIVlA/status/1075482273787637761/video/1 …
Truthfully that’s how it was to bts and still kinda is but journalists who do their research and asking about their UN speech and album and the books that inspired them are increasing so theres some positivity so hyping them up actually helps a lot.
Is it that one article where their UN speech video was mentioned?
2019-03-23T16:44:11.000Z190322 Holland mentioned BTS's UN speech in the interview with KPOP HERALD http://m.kpopherald.com/view.php?ud=201903221407438322519_2#_enliple … #BTS #방탄소년단 BTS_twt https://twitter.com/SUGAJelly9339/status/1109496070009032706/photo/1pic.twitter.com/5KMpBlK5TW
So I was rereading Namjoon's UN speech because I plan on using it for my portfolio aaannnd I cried, AGAIN. *Deep sigh* It's been months but the impression he left not only to us ARMYs but to other people also is huge. If only all the world leaders are like Joonie @BTS_twt
So lastnight I went out to eat with my sister, uncle and his girlfriend. We had such a nice conversation about BTS. Then when I got home I sent her the link to the UN speech and this was her reaction! pic.twitter.com/epUCDqb5uL
the thing i hate MOST is when kpoopies tweet @bts: "teach your fandom""you guys are promoting end violence but-" a) do NOT drag bts into fanwars b) stop "bandwagon" hating armys. bad people exist in EVERY fandom. c) STOP using end violence & the UN speech for your fanwars
Meanwhile BTS gives speech at the UN and ARMYS support them.
Bc in Kim Namjoon’s (one of BTS members) UN speech said tht we should not degrade others regardless of their background. Maybe wht @jeonb00ty is trying to say: we shouldnt bring others bc not everyone is given the advantage
"I'm still me" Bish, I remember UN speech! "Maybe I made plenty and many mistakes yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me." COMMON I'M NOT AFRAID YOU KNO--- AHHHHHHHHH @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/pkjpUvj91J

The UN speech. My best friend’s twitter account was already very BTS focused, but that caught my attention and I never looked back.
@BTS_twt Holland just mentioned about him being personally thankful to RM's UN speech,who is now the only openly gay Idol...And I can't be more proud of him and in fact our boys because he even says that the our boys are doing just great because of the message the songs send us.
Depends on what she might like— music videos for the visual (Fake Love or dna) dance practice videos for choreo, UN Speech for the overall message. Buzzfeed interview with puppies if she likes silly
Imma go give a speech now. Hope I dont mumble and eat my words. BAKDKEIJSKFKFJD. I'll be sharing life values and the idea of loving the self to young people at a school in my place. I patterned my speech to #RM's UN speech. Im so nervooouus. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/VDTQHer9NV
I was sharing with my moots about how the things I learned from @BTS_twt's UN speech helped me recover a significant past relationship today. It was only when the GC began to share too, that I realised how deep an impact that speech has had on each of our personal lives

remember joon’s un speech? ‘And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, and yesterday’s me is still me.’ @BTS_twt
"I'm still me" that's their UN speech
It reminds me of "Yesterday's me is still me" of the Speak Yourself UN speech
On Namjoon's UN speech he said "SPEAK YOURSELF* which is a reference to tour for the new CB.. He also said "YESTERDAY'S ME IS STILL ME" and Now JK *I'M STILL ME*. I SMELL SOMETHING RELATED TO TOUR. pic.twitter.com/JbcXjHcvpQ

There's a saying "tables have turned" now BTS has not only have daesangs but also recognition, perfomance, awards, TV guesting, UN speech and much much more. I just hope we don't turn into those kind of fans that belittle but only show how proud we are of what bts has achieve.

Love the slogan. The UN speech still resonates in me. "What is your name? Speak yourself." This is something I want to ask ALL ARMYS.
I'm really hoping that bts use the UN speech as the skit on Persona
YALL SOME KIDS IN MY SCHOOL WENT ON A FIELD TRIP TO THE UN CENTER AND ALL MY FRIENDS WERE TEXTING ME YEATERDAT THAT THEY MENTIONED HOW BTS WENT THERE AND THE TOUR GUIDE SAID SPECIFALLY “KIM NAMJOON OF THE KPOP GROUP DELIVERED A SPEECH HERE FOR THEIR LOVE MYSELF CAMPAIGN”——-

My friends stan other kpop gp and they always ignore me everytime I open up topic about bts, even when I was telling them about RM speech at the UN and they complete ignore me when I start jamming to bts's songs, I always feel alienated. But well, i smell jealousy. Idgaf really
actually, no.. people aren't hating just for that, she’s a whole jin hater, tried to come for namjoons UN speech, called bts colorists just for wearing suncreen, came taetae's grandparents and what not. She is a bts hater under disguise
Hi can you react to BTS’s UN Speech and live performances (they appeared on Ellen, James Corden, Jimmy Fallon, GMA and more)
how have people literally seen bts stand in front of world leaders at the UN meeting and give a speech yet still turn around and tell me that Large Explosion are the kings of kpop? i have to CACKLE. pic.twitter.com/tLXVWgpmJs
#DearNamjoon I have to write a very difficult email soon & it is admittedly, very scary. I wish I had your great ability w/ words, your writing skills to convey just the right emotion, & eloquence!

35. I started liking BTS when I watched their speech at the UN. That was the day I searched about them, started to listen to their music, and got curious. Their speech hit a spot in my heart no wonder why in just one snap, I loved them already.
WHY DID RM OF BTS GIVE A SPEECH AT THE UN HQ. FURTHERMORE HOW DID MY MOM FIND THIS ON HER OWN
NOT girls. bts would be fucking ashamed of u. remember namjoons UN speech? "gender identity" namjoon said non binary rights https://twitter.com/blushchangbin/status/1108491378810605575 …
I hope @bts_bighit will include RM's UN speech in the album to remind us to love ourselves. Please?
hope and understanding. They even work with @UNICEF on funding world-wide programs that end domestic and sexual violence among youth. They even spoke at the @UN last year! Check out their speech to learn more about them and what they stand for: pic.twitter.com/tpKGihIxKS
They’re a group called BTS, they’ve given a speech at the UN, are a spokesperson for UNICEF presented at the Grammys this year. Check them out if you can, a lot of their songs are very meaningful! I can give you recommendations if you want. pic.twitter.com/Xmm9GAxdLN
Like Felix, BTS had unintentionally hurt other people feelings too. Don't we remember? I don't want to bring the specifics of the BTS controversy. And a lot forgave them right? and people still bring it up and we hate it right? And the UN speech is about "mistakes" right?
#BTS #BTSARMY #ARMY @BTS_twt Now THIS is an example of which type of article the UN speech video can be put/used at. Unlike those who use the video to spread calumny. https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1108292118458613763 …
Bc of Eminem. Lol, I’m Eminem stan for years. When I saw BTS next to Em in BB200, I was so shock and decided to check out their music. I know Kpop and heard sth ab them before but nothing good, we all know the mediaplay. I found they sound fabulous and the UN speech so I stan.
So you want us to love someone who said tried to come for namjoons UN speech, saying jin doesn’t deserve lines, calls BTS colorists and says they are overrated and overhyped yet buying 3 concert tickets because of their visuals? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
damn...it still hasn't sinked in that bts gave a speech at the UN, received order of cultural merit, performed for a friendship concert between Korea and France... And all the in ONE YEAR??? even less IN TWO MONTHS WTF
a bunch of ppl i follow on my personal acount post about bts a lot and i loved the positive energy they radiated (both bts and their stans), so i decided to search for their photos, then i came across the UN speech and it got me hooked. i didnt even sleep for the first two weeks https://twitter.com/KNJTELLECTUAL/status/1107941871056084993 …
Thousands and thousands of armys watch how she talk about how colorist bts is (it's just them applying sunscreen tbh), how jin doesn't deserve lines from some of bts songs and namjoon's un speech. At this point, i think she's just finding faults to every move bts does
just a disclaimer for anyone: people in the replies aren’t angry just over her opinion on idol, she’s a whole jin hater, tried to come for namjoons UN speech, called bts colorists etc.. and still going to see them in concert 3 times while some armys can’t even get tickets.
I knew about them because of all the negative media reports at the height of the fanwars. Felt sorry for them but never listen to their music. Not a kpop/idol fan. It was RM's UN speech that made me check them out. @BTS_twt
I love ur UN speech

BTS also did a speech at the UN general assembly council. If you have the time please just have a listen and maybe you will understand more why so many people love BTS. https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y

Guess who's analysing bts' UN speech for their public speaking competition?? Me! I AM SCARED
oh yeah. i just remember when my lil sister ask me to help her write an argumentative speech. and my topic was about bts UN SPEECH and how they inspire younger generation to love themselves...just focus on bts core values. it will help u just like how it help me
People are like Yk this Specific bg with high sales, came from a country that doesn't speak english, who gave speech in UN and is a seven member group.. Ah right the one who is going to relesse Album in April.. Yeah I hate them but I'm not talking about BTS here. Mind that
What happened in UN do you know? Let me tell you BTS is first KOREAN act how give speech there.
just me after watching emma and bts' speech in un pic.twitter.com/UwtIPbX4LF
An idiot: group which is doing stadium tour, get 2.68M preorder, won twice in bbma, nominated for grammys, have 1 platinum and 4 gold riaa certification, gave speech at UN. ARMY: it's BTS. Same idiot: no, I'm not talking about BTS. It's coincidence and I just know google today.
Funny, I was thinking about that today. I think that is great that everyone's so creative. But I always want to know what their real name is. RM's UN speech keeps coming to mind. "What's your name? Speak yourself "

You caught on quick! Jungkook was my bias and jimin the wrecker and didn’t think it would ever change. Then with Run, Yoongi wrecked. With Bon Voyage, Jin. With UN speech, RM. Then I went to a concert and Hobi and V wrecked it all for me!!

Combined with UN speech "what excites you? speak yourself" this is a journey BTS chooses to do with ARMY cause we're part of their lives and they're part of ours so we can find together the "map of the soul" pic.twitter.com/jntoibK4HR
- Namjoon has an actual chance at winning IF we focuse on voting for him, splitting our vote is pointless. - Mono is his SECOND playlist and like timeless RM was ignored. - He did this while working in the albums, us/uk press, UN speech and his collabs. He deserves to win. #BTS
I have a whole thread about joonie on my pinned for those who want to see his apology also if y’all haven’t you can look up bts un speech where namjoon talks about how his past mistakes have made him into a better person and much more bout having a voice ;))

That is literally not the only thing she has done. She called BTS overrated, accused them of plagiarism, trashed their new music, accused them of colorism, downplayed Joon's speech at the UN, and other stuff. It's past just opinions, she deserves to be under fire for it.

right, she didnt even give praise to namjoon for giving a full speech at the un in english! if she wants to always speak down on bts then why the hell does she even consider herself an army? as armys we are supposed to praise bts so people KNOW who they are
sure homphobic, Namjoon mentioned gender identity (ie. trans people) in his UN speech, Namjoon tweeted about a song about same-gender love and a song from a movie about a gay man, BTS have worked with multiple LGBT artists on production, they said they said everyone's equal,,,,

She is an anti joon and BTS and twisted his UN speech to fit her own narrative
The only reason ik BTS has grown literally Joon told everyone at a whole press conference it's not okay to say nigga and the UN speech , nobody is gonna be full of ignorance after that.
UN speech only BTS is Frist Korean act who give
she faked a saesang interview for clout, accused bts of being colorists for using sunscreen, undervalued bts’s un speech and said with her whole chest that bts are 100% straight and assuming anything else is delusional, so I sincerely ask, what in the actual FUCK

Namjoon is an excellent speaker. I still remember the day of the UN speech. I had tears of pride while watching the speech through the livestream. One of my fav BTS moments. https://twitter.com/cantorpedia/status/1106659284350365696 …
@BTS_twt I have admired you for a long time and at the age of 14 when I have my GCSE’s coming up I had to write a speech and I thought what better to do it about than something and someone I love so I did it about the UN speech. I feel as though that has a lot of meaning...
Suddenly i remembered Namjoon’s UN speech.... NO ONE CALL MY NAME NEITHER DO I @BTS_twt

I've pointed some mature potential ARMY to RM's UN speech as a way of introducing them to @BTS_twt .
Thank you for spreading the speech! @BTS_twt UN speech was so amazing and touched ppl's heart who are open to hear.

@BigHitEnt @BTS_twt @AlcazarSamantha https://youtu.be/yM_Fd3WqSpc Big Hits should sue. This is unacceptable! They had Taehyung’s image in an article & now RM image when he did his speech at the UN.
I never saw the UN speech what made me appreciate them was the fact they were themselves and put their fans first and their music has so much meaning. Their music helps so much with depression/ anxiety! @BTS_twt deserve all this love!
You ever randomly remember that @BTS_twt gave a speech at the UN and you just think.. wow..... these are the men I love and support
Out of curiosity, how did the topic of BTS come up between you two? And what was their reaction to them appearing at the UN? But that’s really great that you referenced the UN speech.
Was explaining the BTS phenomenon to someone. Knew she's way into politics/current events, so I referenced the UN speech. Then I went and re-read the UN speech. Then I remembered how excellent it was. It was (and still is) so underappreciated.
Right now we all need a positive message from men we trust. Everyone please revisit the @BTS_twt special appearance @UN for powerful speech that motivates all generations &unites us Doesn’t matter where you all over the world as you read this: #SpeakYourself #ThankYouBTShttps://twitter.com/BTSchPL_board/status/1100032451529924609 …
un speech, cultural merit award, and the grammys have to be my top three favorite things bts have done over the last few months
But then i encountered them more deeply after namjoon's speech at un and i cried hardly again, they truly told me to raise my self esteem when mine is at my lowest that time thank you for everything @BTS_twt i gotta to go back working on my journal hehe love ya
So I just told my mom about @BTS_twt achievement, what message they try to convey to public, told them about love myself campaign & their speech at the UN, them being on the Grammy and for once, she didn’t say anything bad about them. Mayhaps I snapped
Have you ever listened to BTS? I feel like they'd right up your ally, they have written many songs with deep meaningful lyrics regarding social issues. They have also made a speech at the UN, I think you will find their words interesting. pic.twitter.com/0En5nU6Zj1
@jimmyfallon brought up @IISuperwomanII’s speech at the UN with @BTS_twt on his show You spoke at the UN with #BTS? I love them How was that? They’re incredible...(starts singing IDOL) Chimmy says hi Lilly says hi too #BTSARMY #방탄소년단pic.twitter.com/0hPI9s5Mz2
The speech of #BTS in UN They told us to "Speak yourself" Their speech also inspired for many people all over the world! Thank you BTS, thank you Kim Nam Joon #RM @BTS_twt

It would be more beautiful if they added the UN speech rather than their performance. But i'm still grateful that BTS was in it. They've done so much for their country.

Yeah C-Army here. It’s because of the stupid politics stuff so that they never came to mainland China for concerts. But you know what when BTS was on UN doing the speech they were shown on the Chinese national news
BTS is a south korean band that promotes love and acceptance through their complex concept albums. They gave a speech at the UN and their upcoming album "map of the soul" references Murray Stein's book Jung's Map of the Soul

@BigHitEnt @bts_bighit Hi @USATODAY, why are you using a video of BT*S UN speech in a story that they are not mentioned in and is about a highly sensitive subject & major scandal? Did you not think this would give the wrong idea about who the true perpetrators are?
(( Here is my top 4 why @BTS_twt is best FAN ARMY ! - They will perform on Saturday Night Live on April 13 (my birthday) - They're at the grammys awards - They did a speech at the UN - THEY ARE LEGENDS !! #iHeartAwards2019 #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY #iHeartAwardspic.twitter.com/FCEOB3WXkd
I have to write this paper for English about making changes we goin end violence and using bts’ UN speech as a source
I immediately thought of @BTS_twt and the work the members do both with individual donations, and as a group in collaboration with UNICEF, and the UN speech (individual growth/self-love is important in being able to affect a community), etc.
Seriously the Kings are coming 4/12, we do not have for this shit. Anyway listen to BTS speech at the UN. Maybe you can get some motivation and start loving yourself pic.twitter.com/3XoPnS6IKN
Is it just me? But I dont see bts' un speech or anything bts related on the article?
After that Un speech I’d say @BTS_twt is both
1. The UN speech photo. BTS must have been so happy that day, for they had come so far. 2. The bus stop in You never walk alone. That photo reminds me of the Spring Day song, and I get emotional everytime I listen to it. #BTS #BestFanArmypic.twitter.com/NzFJ6XXPnw
Haha he makes everything look good lol. If you liked him and if you want to, you should check out BTS. You can start by watching their speech at the UN heh.
There's another article that is using BTS's speech at the UN for clout. I'm so sick of it.
like the UN speech has nothing to do with this situation? like it doesn’t belong there AT ALL but they are using it. people are gonna think bts are somehow involved with this scandal. i think we should report it to bighit. https://twitter.com/joonsquad/status/1106097733264388099 …

Hi @USATODAY, why are you using BTS video in this kind of issue?

When I click on it I see BTS UN speech
This is absolutely appalling journalism! You used BTS's UN speech video as clickbait. You are spreading false information by using their image in relation to a horrible scandal. This is grounds to a defamation and miss information lawsuit. Please remove it at once.

The journalist is just from AP. They actually have nothing to do with it. @USATODAY picked up the story from AP & decided it'd be a good idea to add their UN speech under the headline. Trash, clickbait "journalism." Rest assured I won't be clicking on them anymore.
I hope you remove the un speech of BTS fromthe article , rectify it as wellas put coorect and precise informtion to aware public instead of misleading names and video . As a BTS army we demand an apology from you as wellas @USATODAY for the inconvinience . Thank YOU BTS ARMY
From your name i presume you are a korean so must be quite fimiliar with the UN speech of BTS as well as of its uninvolvement in this scandal which will rise to unneccesary confusion .
idk too. but they use bts UN speech as artwork for this scandal
I always want to say this but I don't get the chance to I want to thank you the most RM because your speech at UN and the message conveyed by BTS in all the songs helped me in finding myself and when I feel weak I hear your songs because they give me strength and I love you.

@USATODAY Delete @BTS_twt’s video (UN speech) in the article about kpop idols invloved in the scandals. BTS ARE NOT INVOLVED
Whats fishy about it is they used bts un speech video as the cover of the article and seungris photo wasnt in the article. What kind of journalism is this? Dont mess with bts they are related to this scandal. @BigHitEnt sue them pls and make them go to jail too @USATODAY
why use bts un speech on the cover of the article? And seungris photo is not even in the article. When bts is not even related in the scandal. This article is misleading. Did the writer paid to do this. So people will think the scandal is bts. @USATODAY remove bts un video now
@USATODAY Please delete the content about BTS as they are totally not related to this article. It is unnecessary to mention BTS's UN speech under this article. Please be responsible in order to prevent from dragging innocent people into this issue. Thank you.
@USATODAY ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? WHAT DOES BTS's UN SPEECH HAS TO DO WITH THOSE RATS

if people don’t choose 2!3!/‘Speak Yourself’/Namjoon’s UN speech then whats the point
@USATODAY why are using BTS UN Speech in an unrelated situation it could mislead people edit the article
And now it's happened to BTS with a USA Today article. When you click the article about the scandal, a video of their speech at the UN plays. What is wrong with these organizations? Why can't they take the literal two seconds to google a pic of the perpetrators?

Plus BTS gave beautiful speech at the UN for youth, why would they be racist? Stop accusing things without solid proves.

It’s not the writers doing, the writer wrote for AP and all publications just recycle what AP posts, USATODAY just inserts their Un speech while you r reading their article on their site for god knows what. Just directly keep contacting them and dming.

Yes agree, and ARMY needs to learn that instead of sharing fancams, gifs, memes they must share valuable info about BTS, so the locals learn more about them such as: links to albums, UN speech, nice articles/interviews about them.
3 of the 7 guys with an upcoming album called Map of the Soul: Persona referencing psychoanalyst Carl Jung; same guys with a powerful message of self-acceptance & self-love, which guy on the right spoke of in a speech at the UN last year. so yeah @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/GY3lDH9UuO
okay i just watched RM's UN speech and felt very proud of him & bangtan then i saw he posted the timing... i am proud of u bangtan @BTS_twt
Their diverse music intrigued me, and their rise from humble beginnings made me pay attention. Their sincere messages (like the UN speech they gave) made me a fan, and their charming personalities just made me love them.
BTS is a very difficult opponent, the more they break or disfigure the English language skills of BTS members. And that's when I'm going to laugh really hard, because their idols won't make a speech at the UN with a weighty theme like speak yourself
For those of you who may wonder why @BTS_twt connects to millions of us, please have a listen to #RM #BTS leader @UN speech. Their sincerity, humble and genuiness is embedded in self-produced music.

How to market @BTS_twt . Give them statistics, fun facts, their UN speech, etc. To attract more adult armys and the gp. Don't spam them more likely even you, you don't want to be spammed. https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1105936843512733697 …
I sent my friend who knows nothing about kpop, Namjoon's UN speech and this was her reaction. If this doesn't show how amazing and how beautiful the message BTS is trying to put out, then idk what does. pic.twitter.com/qmcHGW7EW4
did bts drop persona hints with the un speech........
True! I didn’t buy into what I saw as Kpop cuteness & contrived nature. I was into rock all my life. But I always supported representation & people doing more for others. I opened to @BTS_twt after the UN speech bec they seemed different. I’ll be seeing them next week in HK!
exactly! dropping statistics & facts, combined with links to their UN speech, spotify playlist, lyrics, etc. will appeal more to the general public. most adults might be put off by a cringy fan cam "omg those HiPtHrUsTs" and think bts is only for teen girls and also we need to(1)
And they’re releasing a new mini album the week they’re on your show. They also spoke at the UN (my pinned tweet is their speech) and have great messaging (loving yourself). I think you’d like mic drop which they did with @steveaoki :https://youtu.be/kTlv5_Bs8aw
"That would be cringey" Bitch, your faves talked about their clapped lightstick in a morning show while BTS talked about their UN speech and their sold out tour at that same show
Lol what your problem. We are doing our part spreading bts music because the world needs to hear that message about loving yourself. love ends violence. Listen to Bts UN speech, their music and the message embedded, It is there to help end violence through loving oneself
But it was the UN speech that sealed the deal. I got a better idea of what BTS is about and what their message is, and I'm SO happy that the LY series exists
Yes, it's important to be yourself! I think the OP meant more: "fangirl more about things that appeal more to them". So, be less: "DID YOU SEE THOSE HIP THRUSTS? " and more: "OMG, did you read the lyrics? " and "Did you see the UNICEF campaign and UN speech? "
If you see any hate comments or someone says its just kp*p, please please just ignore it, it doesn’t worthed to educate gp about the kp industry and why our boys are diff! Reply them with @BTS_twt messages, lyrics, concepts, UN speech, ref books etc
No they don't. Just the previous week, they dragged a kpop group & their stans for it. Just bc you liked it, doesn't mean the majority does or are open-minded. That's why we agreed to link BTS music and IF asked, briefly talk about BTS (song message, UN speech, album).
Since many curious gp are asking about BTS, link them songs or tell about BTS, UN speech.. don't link fancams, or memes and be sweet to people
Everything is like a dream to me. In 3 years, their first daesang at MAMA to BBMAs,AMAs Winner & Performer, award presenter at Grammys, gave speech at UN, youngest Cultural Merit Winner etc. They have grown and achieved all their dreams and dominate the World. #BTSxSNL @BTS_twt
Super Human? They performed the craziest concert in Canada, I couldn't even wake up until 12 the next day. But what do they do? Fly to New York the same night and give a speech at the FREAKING UN looking like GODS. #BTS #BTSxARMY #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY @BTS_twt #iHeartAwards
NO DAY HAS EVER BEEN BORING AFTER THE LEGENDARY UN SPEECH FOR ME #BTSxSNL #BTSonSNL
Okay so the skit on their album better be the one on SNL or Namjoon's UN speech. @BTS_twt #BTSxSNL
BTS is a 7 member band from South Korea. They write meaningful lyrics about social issues and injustices, Unicef GenUnlimited Ambassadors, gave a speech at the UN, speak about mental health issues, varied and deep discography-check them out https://youtu.be/D_6QmL6rExk
Respect others likings plz. If u think it's garbage then think again after you have "really" heard it. Understand the lyrics, go through some articles and see RM's UN speech. You'll know who they r.
I was among the few who wasn’t into Gangnam Style & I only knew Despacito because it played in my Zumba workout but I am now totally into @BTS_twt - UN speech, Not Today, & Micdrop got me started.
I agree. BTS has become a household name. Their accolades, achievements, the UN Speech, BTS’s global impact raising Cultural Awareness & Tourism on SK & the charity works BTS & Armys have done are fully recognized now by the GP.
WHAT IF AN ARTICLE FOR MY TEST IS @BTS_twt UN SPEECH SJDJSKS WATCH ME CRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TEST
Wow ARMY is so diverse..happy to meet you all..Yamuna 42 from India following @BTS_twt since Namjoon's speech at the UN..Working in the commodities trading industry, enjoys sketching, jewellery making, writing &traveling. Love all 7 kids but Rapline is my bias. #FindYourPERSONA
Skit: UN Speech @BTS_twt #prePERSONA
New ARMY hesitating to buy #MapOfTheSoulPersona because it's a mini album, don't worry... BTS' mini album usually has 9 songs, including title +intro+outro+ a skit. It's worth buying, if you can afford. I suppose the skit will be the UN speech. @BTS_twt #prePERSONA

BTS’ message will be expressed through this tour’s performances. BH is planning local promo events & will openly invite the press pic.twitter.com/sR9DnyoO9z
i told him that i was doing bts’ UN speech for my essay and he was like did you hear about the prostitution thing that guy did dhabah
Not even one. I stan too late when I know them since 2013. not into kpop back then..But I knew kpop since 2010, just not a fan. Untill I saw bts's UN speech, and really curious who they are, searched info of them and could understand why they gained a lot of fans.. No regret tho,
Any RUN EPISODE... RM's speech at UN and listen to IDOL, CYPHER PT4 and a compilation of BTS and ARMY singing together on concerts ....!
(( And i heard @BTS_twt on LIVE FM Radio in my hometown for the first time! Thanks to @915theBeat . with the song "Waste It On Me" and saw BTS on AGT, The Ellen Show, The Tonight Show, GMA & others and saw BTS at the UN with their amazing speech. #FarewellLoveYourself ))pic.twitter.com/GBiFqDLXUS
unlike big bang who were coached and trained to act the way they do, what bts show us is genuine. they give away so much of their hearts and put out music that shapes the world. joon even wrote a powerful speech for the un. if there's anyone we can trust, it's bts. not bigbang.
Lol dumb . Just like yo hitman wrote lyrics to cyphers lol and spring day was written by rm and it's the most beautiful song of BTS ( song or mv not in bu universe ) new armys are born THROUGH bts interview and rm made speech for un not hitman .
+ the map of the soul will guide us to through off our masks & personas not only embrace the person underneath but to do what Namjoon told us to do at his UN Speech - speak ourselves. It makes total sense that thats the title of the next leg of tour :') #FindYourPersona @BTS_twt
Do you think theyre gonna use UN speech for their skit track? #FindYourPersona @BTS_twt
Y’all ever think about how BTS deadass went to the UN and Namjoon gave a speech. The UN. They went to the fucking UN
Ok but we need Skit: UN speech #FindYourPersona @BTS_twt So excited!!!
I wrote about Namjoon's UN speech as apart of my college essays and I GOT IN I KNEW HE WOULDN'T LET ME DOWN @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/idolrapline/status/1104483927237029888/video/1 …
I am new to kpop; this is a random thought; Why do so many LGBT people like K-pop? (Besides it being good music & the idols being conventionally attractive/cute) I mean I know BTS did a speech at the UN about being yourself & that was cool. (Imma out myself, but I love Jimin)
i asked my english teacher if i can use bts' speech at the UN as a personal document for my final exam and she said "oh yea of course you can i know them they're cuties" AND IM
please, you don’t know what you are talking about. at least do some research. bts have made many people love theirselves,, including me. in their songs they talk about self acceptance and how it is okay to be the person you are. even at the un speech bts had a beautiful speech. pic.twitter.com/24JwWolEQK
This person said that its useless that our bts had speech in UN, but we dont understand what humanity is. Majority Army dont even know before about BS case, eventhough there are some army who insult him. But, dont involve our boys in your mess okay. Just hate army not bts pic.twitter.com/VchKaOQcka
Artists @BTS_twt in association with @UNICEF started a anti violence Love Myself campaign. They continued to spread their positive influence through UN General Assembly ‘Speak Yourself’ speech. Cr: @cutsiejoon https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bts/8483029/bts-unicef-love-myself-campaign-money-raised …pic.twitter.com/p0pwgeSMv0
it all makes sense now, speak yourself, RM UN’s speech (he is Kim Namjoon and RM), their clues on MAMA (the masks) and other things, bts is doing this concept because they’re SPEAKING FOR THEMSELVES, about who they really are. suddenly i’m in tears.
My mind going everywhere but heres some of it 1. Theres lgbt+ member 2. They are true to their words about it(that un speech) 3. They will proof what they say, not only talk about it 4. Txt will come off adult in that mean years 5. It'll be a huge scandal in bts 10/+ anniversary
additionally, in their music bts talks about many important topics and they partnered with unicef, went to the un and gave a speech, and cares immensely about their fans, and all wdw talks about is girls.
noah fence but ppl rlly out here tweeting “omg!! namjoon said speak yourself at the UN speech! it makes sense now!!” it was kinda obvious that it was a comeback hint lmao. BTS is always preparing the next step, it’s our job as ARMY to keep up w them @BTS_twt #MapOfTheSoulPersona
When my 65 y.o. mom asked me to show her BTS stuff I showed her Dope because it's simple, kinda like village people lol where they're all distinct recognizable characters w a rly solid choreo & catchy song. She rly liked it. I also showed her the UN speech & she loved that too!
This part reminds me of what BTS has been talking about also. Duality (idols/humans), loneliness (that comes with being an idol) identity (which he talks about in UN speech), insanity (mental health) & represent all of these through their music ( themes & stories.) My thoughts. pic.twitter.com/AMaRzsrRZk
It’s amazing they are using their platform to talk about themes like this. To explore who you really are. To know your mask, and to know what is behind it. It’s encouraging a healthy sense of self and self acceptance. Just like RM said in UN speech. I’m eager to take this journey
. @BTS_twt's speech at the UN drew in such new and diverse audiences last year. I'm excited to see the kind of minds and hearts an album centred around Jungian psychology (and the journey to self) will attract #MapoftheSoul
@ShashiTharoor a few words on @BTS_twt Kim Namjoon's UN Speech #BTSisComing #MapoftheSoulhttps://twitter.com/joonjuly33/status/1098930860361801728 …
You know, after Joonie’s speech at UN, people really interested in what type of band they are. This album Map of The Soul, i really have a good feeling about it. Mybe it will help to change other’s perspective towards them. I hope so. Other words, bh & bts are real genius.
The last webtoon chapter that came out, Jin was struggling and debating himself on how to save Yoongi, a person who doesn't want to be saved. I think this is about him guiding others to their map of their soul, to their own identity, learning about themselves.. hence UN speech
BTS are strong advocates of mental health. They held a speech at the UN to deliver a strong message of self love and empowerment to the youth. Their new album 'Map Of The Soul : PERSONA' comes out on April 12th, make sure to check it out. Until then take care of yourself
ok but i just remembered that some antis used to say namjoon’s un speech was only to promote bts’s next album “speak yourself”????? and now the album’s name is literally “Map of the Soul: Persona” LMAO. THE WAY I LET OUT MY UGLIEST LAUGH pic.twitter.com/nWDPzaeRy6
So BTS upcoming comeback album is related to rm's un speech. It is about finding your name, finding who you really are, and speaking yourself. I think "Persona" means being natural and showing your real self, and being confident for who you really are.
wait. namjoon spoke about his mistakes making up the brightest constellations of his life in his UN speech. that sounds just like a map of the soul? #MapOfTheSoul #BTSisComing #BTSTheory @BTS_twt
Who said that UN speech is not authentic because it's only for promotion? @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSxCanada/status/1105126299704741893 …
Let's add this one too. important files └ extraordinary important └ Namjoons speech at the UN @BTS_twt #RM #NAMJOONpic.twitter.com/nRIG51MmX6
I love that my mom likes bts and when we play bts in the car shes like “okay but bump that shit louder sweetie” and she likes Jimin because of his vocals and Namjoon because of his UN speech ksksksj
AGSHHSJSHS Today in the assembly they were talking about loving yourself and they used the last part of namjoon’s UN speech as reference. We love promo and spreading our president’s positive words! @BTS_twt
It's a long article, elaborating on their achievements, records, UN speech, their messages, donations, etc. All the facts that are familiar to army, but must have been impressive to the reporter who didn't think much of BTS when they made a debut. I'd rather not translate. Sorry
Ya gurl went to an interview. The HR manager asks me if I would like to be a leader or a follower then Namjoon’s UN SPEECH suddently came up to my mind and I chose to be a leader. Namjoon wants us to be a leader, to be a good example to everyone. @BTS_twt
I’m going to listen to Namjoon speech at the UN probably we can find the name of the new album @BTS_twt
Exactly. BTS practice what they preach, what's not clicking. They can complain if what Joon said at the UN Speech ain't what they're campaigning -- but even now when it's aligned, ppl still find ways to complain smh....
Same for me! I had been ARMY for a little over two months when Answer came out, but I didn’t join twt until the UN speech. So I’m excited and nervous to experience the difference with my second comeback!
Ok guys let's use some math for #BTS: Title of the comeback: Speak Yourself Theme of the UN speech: Love and Speak Yourself Random thing they do in albums: skits What if they insert the full speech as a skit for the new album??? @BTS_twt #BTSisComingpic.twitter.com/XM0bbL8c0S

confession of today: that one thing that really REALLY got me into BTS was actually Namjoon’s inclusive language when he spoke about love in their american interviews (that was the first thing I watched) And of course later on I felt especially proud of his speech at the UN GA
i just played the un speech to my parents, showed them many videos in polish about who bts are, played them spring day, and i can’t stop crying, my mum said “i can’t wait to see you finally loving yourself”
when you hear idols talk about BTS, you would rarely hear them talk about Namjoon. The fact that Kevin sat down and listened to his UN speech, praised his English, and even went far enough to say that Namjoon has a great mind... I respect his respect
BTS Gives a UN Speech https://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs via @YouTube
I really want these people to leave the fandom.. BTS is lgbtq supporter, Namjoon's UN speech, that one fan meeting where a fanboy asked JK if he would date him, JK answered yes. All these couldn't change them then nothing will. Better they leave BTS.
Kevin from The Boyz talks about RM & his English skills. “If I had to pick one member, I would have to say RM sunbaenim. After watching the UN summit speech that he gave, I was like WOW this guy is amazing" @BTS_twt #BTSARMY #BestFanArmy #iHeartAwardspic.twitter.com/yvSJEJ8Dcj
Uh bts was on TIME and went to UN, giving speech, still feel so unreal like did that really happen
I honestly signed up here because of @BTS_twt's UN Speech. When I discovered the speech, I can relate a lot bcs I've been in the same circumstance that it's hard for me to speak myself in amidst of my demanding society. Like, I was born free yet everywhere I am now in chains.
he is a perfect soul and i don't know what i would do without him in bts. he is such an influential person as well. it just always seems that he is only remembered for his mistakes, un speech, and speaking english. i really just hope people appreciate him more. he deserves it.
someone just asked kevin who’s his favorite member from bts and he answered that he has a lot of respect for namjoon!! Here’s his message for RM he even talked about the moment when namjoon gave a speech at the UN #BTS #더보이즈pic.twitter.com/4DzMFcVUe2

just watched #kevin from #THEBOYZ 's vlive and somebody asked who he would choose from @BTS_twt he said its hard to pick but it would be #RM because of his leadership and interectual mind #RM 's speech at the un was great
someone asked kevin who’s his fav member from BTS and kevin said “RM sunbaenim” he even brought up about the moment when namjoon gave a speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/p4Khsze0Oe
KEVIN JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW BTS’S SUCCESS WAS A REFLECTION OF THEIR LOVE FOR MUSIC, HARDWORK AND LOVE FOR FANS AND SAID THAT NAMJOON WAS HIS BIAS CAUSE HE SAW HIS SPEECH AT THE UN AND FOUND HIM AMAZING AND INSPIRATIONAL AND HAS MAD RESPECT FOR HIM AND SEND HIM A FINGER HEART PLS
MY ARMYDEOBI/DEOBARMY HEART IS THRIVING. KEVIN ON VLIVE TALKING ABOUT HIS RESPECT FOR BTS AND ESPECIALLY NAMJOONS UN SPEECH I CANNOT DEAL GOODBYE.
someone asked kevin who’s his fave member from bts and he answered that he has a lot of respect for namjoon, he watched his speech at the UN and he’s impressed by how joon keeps improving his eng especially since it’s not his mother tongue :( he also said he’s a great leader i’m
kevin’s favorite member of bts is namjoon! he complimented his intellect and said ever since he saw his speech at the UN that he has had a lot of respect for him. he also talked about how good his english is despite it not being his native tongue!!
For skz you can use start line, and mixtape 3 and for bts you can use Namjoon UN speech!!

He gets all the hype only when BTS goes to the west and after his UN speech. Still it's an improvement And 'but Namjoon' should be stopped to justify someone's mistakes.

DREAMING OF THIER UN SPEECH TO BE INCLUDED AS ONE OF THIER TRACK IN THE NEW ALBUM @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/WZs2DYNOOD
Many credits he shd hv are generalized as BTS’ credits. He wrote amazing lyrics =>BTS hv amazing lyrics. He wrote the UN speech himself =>BTS ask us to speak ourselves. But when things go slightly wrong ppl throw Joon n only Joon under the bus becoz he is the leader.
How I became @BTS_twt #ARMY: - @AuthorNinaPerez having excellent taste & enthusiasm - Mic Drop (this choreo is legit) - Choreo rehearsal videos - RM's joke - Reaction videos - Who is who - Everyone's backstory - UN speech - Reality TV clips - Live shows (interviews, performances)
If locals tweet about @BTS_twt and include the word “k-pop”, don’t give them the “iT’s bTsPoP” talk. Just give them a short reply about BTS being the 2nd best-selling artist of 2018 and their UN speech or say that you’re willing to give them recommendations if they want and GO.
The jealousy is snapping again? How pathetic of them. @BTS_twt has been speaking and sending messages of loving yourself from the very beginning. Besides those words including the UN speech is their own, from their brilliant minds.
the speak yourself tour is named that bc it’s some of the most memorable words from the UN speech, which was given in the midst of one of the most uplifting eras bts has ever had. it’s nothing more and nothing deeper than THAT.
When bts announced a Speak Yourself Tour, and performed intro: orul82 at MAMA, that’s them following through on the roadmap they made at the UN. Just as the LY series walked fans through the ideas in NJ’s fancafe post, SY will follow the UN speech.
Like the fancafe post from 2015, the ending words of the UN speech, including the call to “Speak Yourself” is a roadmap for BTS’ future albums. Not because of PR machine marketing, but because there’s no line between what they say publicly and their music.
I want to talk some about BTS, their UN speech, and the Speak Yourself tour because I saw a tweet complaining about the tour being called Speak Yourself and how it turns “sincere words into BH propaganda” I strongly disagree.
What is even RM doing? Is this the same person who gave speech at UN??
i mean i respect that i was just talking about how now the un speech seems like marketing and it lessens it's sincerity? but im not hating on bts at all i dont understand the hatred im receiving
what's even weirder is that the next bomb might be called 'bts' speech at the UN' or 'bts at the Grammys' and that's completely normal for them as well https://twitter.com/carpejms/status/1103960649019809793 …
my dad and i just watched bts on ellen and namjoons speech at the un and he thinks they’re amazing people i’m soft
Oh no! I know what he went through and I always worry it will happen to Bts. Like when they said em didn’t write the UN speech.
I agree, it's one of the things I dislike seeing under a tweet. It's annoying and goes nowhere. It just seems immature to me. Lyric videos, audio, & the UN speech has more positive results, especially to those who disliked BTS in the beginning
Did anyone notice this? So this theme is “speak yourself” but BTS actually gave us clues for us to realize this theme. At the UN speech RM said many times to speak yourself. They knew their theme since then. Mind blown #ARMY @bts #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/1SB3o2v2Uc
also,, im making my bro listen to rm's un speech to change his mind abt bts skskd
Tell your mum that these 7 guys are sweet, caring, heartwarming, humble, talented...They’re role model who never give up even in the hard times. They were even invited by the UN to give a speech to the young generation about #LoveYourself #SpeakYourself Tell her pls let you go.
Oh and lets not forget how your fandom twisted RM words in hus UN speech for your fanwars and accused bts of emotional manipulation of their MAMA speach
Armys who are degrading namjoon for this soompi award are not allowed to flex with bts deep lyrics next time. They're not allowed to post about 21st century girls or am I wrong. They're not allowed to talk about love yourself era, they're not allowed to speak about UN speech
Sorry for spamming @BTS_twt UN speech in your tweet https://twitter.com/ilovesmokingmid/status/1104237506747219968 …
I love that vids!! This is also a nice one, showcasing their vocals, with updated info and a sneak peek of UN speech https://youtu.be/Ac8J8iC3FX4
He goes on to highlight their accomplishments bc as he writes, “there are too many to count.” He especially praises Namjoon’s UN speech and their charitable contributions and how this has in turn inspired ARMYs to take on charity projects too. @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/JH2Y2X5m7T
Give them Namjoon's UN speech. That was so major and touching. He has won over so many of my irls with that speech.
bruh bts antis wanna defame them so bad........... I cant hear your negative energy i’m streaming answer: Love myself, the UN speech, and ddaeng
Joon is incredible. Just amazing in every aspect of his person. His growth and journey into learning how to love himself and in turn encouraging others to do the same is his UN speech and his ment at CitiField are still my inspiration for being positive and happy
This video has a good summary of their history. The UN speech is good also https://youtu.be/8XxYHkGM_lA
WATCH | BTS Leader Kim Namjoon gives his speech at the launch of Generation Unlimited, at the UN General Assembly regarding their campaign “Love Myself” with UNICEF https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg

What I find funny about BTS non fans is that they don't expect the members to have such deep voices.the number of comments feom locals about Namjoon's deep voice under his UN speech video
yallllllllll my lit teacher is letting me write my research paper on bts' un speech
Me too! It'll be my second as ARMY but my first since starting this account & joining stan twt (the UN speech was what finally convinced me to take that dive) - I don't think I'm ready!

You ever wake up in the dead of night and remember that BTS got a standing ovation after their speech at the UN and after Trumps speech he got laughed at

#DearNamjoon, I watched your UN speech again today. I cried. Again. And I've learned things. 1) My love for BTS meme is too much that it annoyed people. I might have to know the proper time to tweet it. 2) I can't stop doing things in 1)
They just blew up after agt, un speech, jimmy fallon etc. It did wonders for bts and now we really here selling out stadiums with more dates
I became an Army after hearing Namjoon's speech at the UN, I was blown.. within few days I showed my colleague that same speech and history repeated .. she does not call herself Army but listens to BTS.. then she introduced her cousins to BTS.
She said she would go home and check out their music and she was very curious about their speech in the UN..i still havent met her after thatill ask her what she felt about BTS when we meet
About the deep meanings their lyrics have..about how they keep trying to send a message yo the young generation to love themselves and stay strong and then i told her about BTS giving a speech in the UN..after this she said she wasnt really into kpop but after hearing about BTS
BTS really went to UN and Namjoon delivered his godly speech. Let that sink in. Which group did IT? Only BTS.
me: i don't know why my friend won't get into bts them: send her the un speech me: eh... nah i have something better *sends text* AMBER LOOK. AT. HIM. pic.twitter.com/RROrALG0NJ
ya'll say that every single damn time I'm tired ya'll said 2016 was BTS's peak, they went higher in 2017 with BBMAs, AMAs, BB Charts, etc. You said 2017 was the peak, they went higher in 2018 with Grammys, BBMA performance, BB charts, Citi Field sold out concert, UN speech, ++
I introduced my father to BTS by their UN speech and now even he loves their music he is just a crazy BTS fan like me and he encourages me to listen to Korean songs saying Music has no language. I am happy that I have a family member who is an army
Speak Yourself A song was written by V-ARMY for blood donation project. Inspired by RM’s speech at the UN, we wrote this song for BTS, for ARMY, and for anyone finding their own voice. https://bit.ly/2Nvs38K #FSFL2 #Suga27thBirthday #SpeakYourselfARMYSong @BTS_twt
What could she lecture you on? BTS especially teaches a lot so maybe starting off with some of their more serious interviews or the UN speech would help
I keep sharing BTS related articles/posts on FB including d 2 movie check-ins. So some ppl searched & askd abt dem. Shared some MVs, interviews, speech@UN 2 sum 3-4 friends/cousins. They liked & appreciated. #BestFanArmy #iHeartAwards #BTSARMY @BTS_twt
Giving the link of the UN Speech usually gets them interested. Then it's either I give a Spotify or YT link and don't ask any further. I give it a day or 2 before I ask what they think. It's been good so far. Nothing to fear coz @BTS_twt music is good.
My second local friend, I showed her the lyrics of Paradise because I feel like it’s such a relatable song. I also showed her a few of their songs she might like, TTU, I NEED U, etc. I also made her watch the UN speech. She told me that she understands why I love @BTS_twt so.
I keep talking about @BTS_twt with my friends but people my age are way to busy or caught up in their problems to listen to them actively. They acknowledge their success, especially UN speech and Wembley, like the songs I play to them, but not to the point to become Army.

If there was armys doin tat, they would be suspended by us. They way the kpop stans joke abt disbandment, made fun of bts emotional speech, mocking namjoon's UN speech all of ts shows that they really dont care of the real issues.
does anyone have a HQ short/summery video of namjoons UN speech that focused on the campaign part or ANYTHING? i have a speech on their @bts_love_myself campaign tmw & i wanna add in a short video to show the locals the true power of our president & the power/influence they have

In honor of @BTS_twt UN speech. I know that speech touched a lot of us and so we wanted to create a design that related to that. What do you guys think? pic.twitter.com/Pmch2z1owq
I think some people find it difficult to seperate geniuine armys who want bts to have the best promos vs managermys that claim joon didnt write his un speech and think bts are stupid.
so , he is the same person who gave a speech at UN right? hahahahhaa. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KsgYmG2e6f
BTS is first KOREAN act who gives speech in UN Aren't we talking about this pic.twitter.com/ExjAok1kdQ
Yes, this is the guy who gave the UN speech. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/5VpVAxzJCM
OVER FOR BTS! It’ll be over when they get a cultural merit, UN speech, Grammy nomination and presenter and get 10 million album sales and become the second best selling act of 2018 WORLDWIDE!! Also with the longest charting k song on Melon. Don’t compare where you don’t compete
I talked to my hair brother and he listened to Idol, Fake Love and Namjoon's UN speech and loved them all !! He is an awesome guy.
All his speeches are amazing and so memorable I practically have his Dartmouth speech memorised. And the Dartmouth pres was the WB president who took selfies with BTS at the UN btw!
We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to “SPEAK MYSELF”. -RM speech in UN 2018 #ARMYSelcaDay #BTSinSummer_Eyes @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/q2rrBhfd2F
Awww! Thank you! BTS’ fans love to adopt animals for animals rescues under BTS’ name! Normally we do it for a member’s birthday. BTS also has their own unicef campaign again violence! Also we totally agree with you. It’s super annoying. @UN speech: https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
So I have to right journal entries in a Leadership Course Im in rolled in and the Professor just came to me and said “I’m learning so much about k-pop through your journals” I’ve written about the UN speech and meaningful lyrics that BTS has
Shes not an army but she acknowledges that I am one so she would tag me whenever bts would appear in her feed like their TIMES magazine spread and UN speech
WHEN IS NAMJOON AND HER GOING TO CALLAB??? I WANT THEM IN THE NEXT UN SPEECH @BTS_twt MAKE IT HAPPEN https://twitter.com/Jstlivinbbyy/status/1101593400388726785 …
Bts is a 7 member south korean group that self produces and write songs on socio political issues and the importance of self love. They gave a speech at the UN last year on the importance of self acceptance. They have a diverse discography.
U already debuted and now u r biggest boy band, attended Grammys, gave speech at UN, became 2nd best selling artists and many more things happened And became an inspiration for millions of ppl @BTS_twt ur the best.
BB really have no idea what the demographics for the two fandoms are. Most ARMYs r actually mature and can work. And those who can't will ask their parents. The parents take ONE look at BTS lyrics, UN speech and UNICEF and they will be willing. But what has BP achieved?
what speak yourself is ann abt their speech at the UN and abt the end violence campaign. He was really amazed by that. he asked for their music and I told him abt the diversity of their music and he should check out fake love rocking vibe mix cause he likes rock music
I’m 37 and love their music and message. The speech they gave to the UN and the charity work they spearheaded is important
Armys are really good at promoing to locals but it doesn’t hurt to remind ourselves, always promo @BTS_twt’s work w UNICEF, their UN speech, their participation in writing, producing and composing, and their socio-conscious and socio-political messages in their music https://twitter.com/KNJTELLECTUAL/status/1102355249463881728 …
Yeah that's how we should promote to others. Use the UN speech, post links to music/lyrics, or show live performances. This showcases BTS's artistry as musicians, performers, and what kind of people they are
Wow, @BTS_twt Namjoon's speech at UN got 1MILLION likes already! The other 17+ million Army should come and like it too.. Link : https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=09 …pic.twitter.com/oExq6w4emT
This sounds like this this manageramy on this bird app. They claimed that joon didnt write his un speech or someone that lurks on reddit that shxts on every bts achievement.
Last time they did the same and git dragged by locals One of them said why kpop stans are arrogant Im glad that armys talk about bts lyrics,un speech,music diversity to promote them
It's great isn't it. If you want to know more about them. Here is their leader giving a speech at the UN https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
imagine naming ur extended world tour after ur UN speech only bts can relate
Agreed... at this point people are just pulling at straws. it’s very rare for one person to write and compose a song, it’s always collaboration. So trying to downplay bts’ involvement is crazy.. And I’d live to know where her evidence of the UN speech is
I hope its joons turn again since what am i to you was SO GOODDDD Imagine if the intro is just the UN speech omg i wouldnt even be mad HAHA
She even dares to say that joonie didn’t write his UN speech when the speech is consisted of bts’ song lyrics which joon fckin wrote
Is there a movie you could watch over and over again, but never get tired of? — bts un speech https://curiouscat.me/tfwbts/post/805057672?t=1551634492 …
Surpass BTS?? Plz come to me when ur faves gets nominated for Grammys, give speech at UN, becomes best global artists in this world, solds out 5 stadiums within 12 hours, 2.2M album sales and so on. Plz tag me when they achieve all these
Their UN speech and appearance. More specifically when joonie ended his speech saying "I am Kim Namjoon or RM of BTS from a small town in Korea." I was ugly sobbing.
gotta love how french journalists talk about bts as the "most popular band no one heard of" as if it didn't come from a desire to not talk about the asian band that tops billboard charts, makes a speech at the un, attends grammies, and sells stadiums out all over the world
Namjoon's speech at the UN led me to BTS.. being part of the corporate world for a long time, am kind of hard to please, but was impressed by his maturity, passion and his perspective, so looked him up & here I am. #TwitterBestFandom #TeamBTS #SoompiAwards @BTS_twt

Honestly when the series came out I didn't know what to expect, I honestly didn't get what the message meant but I just kinda figured it out and that showed me how to love myself and after RM's speech at the UN I made my own LED lights that said " #lovemyself" in my room
From produce 101s2. I wonder why the trainees are fighting to perform BTS's Fire. Then follow with Namjoon speech at UN before I consider BTS are a worthy group to be followed beside CNBLUE. #TwitterBestFandom #SoompiAwards #TeamBTS
I got Namjoon! I would definitely say thank you for inspiring me to be myself! His speech that he made at the UN was one of the best things I have ever heard! #TwitterBestFandom #SoompiAwards #TeamBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/kN59cMSK3b

I got to know from their UN Speech about loveyourself campaign
wait ,,, if BTS’s next comeback is called speak yourself .... does that mean we’ll get skit: UN speech on the album ,,,
For people who is asking about BTS, they represent youth to give a speech at UN amd talk about "Speak Yourself" https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=19 …
bts coming back to their new album "speak yourself" to find our armys were literally streaming namjoon's UN speech
BTS's biggest flex is and will always be hiding their Speak Yourself comeback announcement inside their UN speech, and that's the fucking tea. @BTS_twt #BTS #SPEAK_YOURSELF_Tour
sure. enjoy Listen to Namjoon UN Speech X Epiphany - Speak Yourself by Min #np on #SoundCloudhttps://soundcloud.com/ripley-cohen/namjoon-un-speech-x-epiphany-speak-yourself …
Lastly, their words and message resonate with many generations, and a few months ago were invited to the UN to hold a speech. One of the members has released a mixtape a few months ago which many called music therapy because it rlly resonates with many. pic.twitter.com/Xl90v8Xv6n
I am a 40-smtg year old.. Trust me, BTS isn’t just for the “kids” Meaningful lyrics about social issues and injustices, Unicef GenUnlimited Ambassadors, gave a speech at the UN, speak about mental health issues, varied and deep discography-check them out https://youtu.be/xEeFrLSkMm8

worse, yall even made viral twets mocking bts UN' speech.....but well, ig yall support asian representation as long as its not bts
my ex english teacher that moved school is using bts speech at un to teach speech writing.. can he pls come back
You all k-pop stans only want Asian representation when it's about your fave k-pop group or you wouldn't have clowned BTS' Grammy nomination and UN speech, voted against them when they were first nominated for a Billboard award, called them thirsty for western validation. https://twitter.com/uaenasus/status/1101546746012975105 …
That's the only awards ya'll winning? Why u acting like one direction was at the grammys and gave a speech at the UN general assembly like pic.twitter.com/gllLMqkWtp
Here you have #RM Kim Namjoon BTS leader UN speech. He’s philosophical, poetic, thought provoking. He speaks from his heart. Wise beyond his years, he’s a 94 liner. I love him as much as I respect him, truly gifted https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156 …
clearly...u can tell when they constantly say/imply bts was just b*p replacement and talk like b*p could've also done the UN speech if their company was just better hshshhs
We had a reporting about the UN and Globalization a while ago and GUYS!! My classmates used @BTS_twt's UN speech (I was literally trying not to freak out) #SPEAK_YOURSELFpic.twitter.com/foZL7lKAaa
Yes.. BTS is BTS, 1D is 1D So i stan the right group who gave a speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/H9KsLM5dPh
Un speech, sold out stadiums, top of music charts, Worldwide awards, order of cultural merit award, lots of money. Behind this is hard work, sincerity, and a great attitude. They are humble, they donate, they give us their heart. They are genuine, @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/SSpJ6EolfB
This blow up, just want you guys to know that BTS WENT TO GRAMMY, BTS GIVING SPEECH AT UN, BTS SOLD OUT WEMBLEY AND FAKE LOVE IS THAT SONG OF THE YEAR!
@BTS_twt "Yesterday's me, is still me" said Namjoon in his UN speech. Sometimes I can't believe in that. How is it possible that the girl full of dreams and hope from yesterday, is still me? How is it possible? I know, he also said "Today I am who I am with all my faults and +

[ @BTS_twt x Press] Trad. The Newspaper La Nouvelle République published an article about BTS following the ticket sale for The Stade de France. The themes of their songs, the UN speech, the President Moon Jae-In's apraisal are mentionned. https://twitter.com/lanouvellerep_/status/1101539224413790210?s=19 …
You are never too old to listen to music. I really hope you read some lyrics to their songs or maybe even listen to their leaders, RMs, speech at the UN to understand that they talk about things both older and younger audiences can relate to. And thank you for being respectful.
Always start off with an MV that is similar to their tastes. Or dependent on your grandma, their UN speech or a simple thing like playing BTS music in the background. Slowly gets them into it.
What people need to understand is that BTS is thriving because we armys are focused on making BTS thrive, all of that while still shutting some mouths up. When yall gonna understand it? No UN speech, no opinion. No Wembley Stadium sold out in 90 minutes, no opinion. Periodt. pic.twitter.com/Ew233aHmvn
After listening to Namjoon's UN speech she rambled to me about how important she thinks it is to let people be themselves before worrying about them fitting a specific gender role and djdkkdd she already Gets It™ with BTS I'm weak. https://twitter.com/KurageCharms/status/1101536778081656833 …
Whatever you say won't change a single thing so let me just go watch BTS speech on UN and then go to work.
And btw before you want to start an argument about bts do your research. Who’s the the first kpop group to sell out the largest UK stadium? Who’s the group that made it to the Grammys? Who’s the group that had a speech at the UN? Who funded the anti-violence awareness?
I saw on a post that she isn't even a fan. She once bashed bts on her ig story abt the UN speech then one day she started posting vids abt bts saesangs, etc.
was it really fake? and yes the fact that she twisted namjoon’s un speech words really says a lot about her... also not to mention the fact that she always seems to criticize everything bts do... it just doesn’t sit right if she really is a “fan” of bts
bro that's some good shit. and the un speech helped me with my English project once thank god for joon
we know the channel and no, no ones gonna click on it to give her more money. she’s making her own “merch” of bts and sellin it for $160, she nitpicks at them, and she tried to twist namjoons UN speech around and make it bad. & she used a BAD example to “prove” a point.
And best example for last one being BTS' UN speech. All media said its first kpop act as if any Artist Asian or even American did it first. Or will anytime soon. They just said it was success for kpop and not BTS
tea. bp is certainly on another level!!!!!! bts who sold out Wembley tix in just 90 mins or are the second best selling artist in 2018 or the ones who gave speech at UN? naah..i only know my yt queen
i’m so proud of bts oh my god . the things they’ve achieved this year alone still feels surreal like the grammys and then last year with the speech at the un and now THIS?????? they keep thriving and it makes me so happy, it’s what they deserve
That's really, really adorable! Also Joon's UN speech was amazing - not surprised it captured hearts. I found them in early November 2017 so I'm a DNA era ARMY. About a year older than you.
Yes! I can say I’m a UN A/RMY, cause I watched RMs speech on my IG search, then went to YT and watched @jimmyfallon interview, performances and well.. so yes that was my A/RMY christening.
“I now understand why you like @BTS_twt so much. It’s not only their music but also their message and who they are as individuals.” -My friend after I talked about the boys, their message, & showed her the UN speech & couple of songs. I feel like a proud mama...
I showed the UN speech of BTS to my dad and I think his impression on the boys is starting to change. He also complimented Namjoon’s accent when he spoke English I’m fucking sweating I’m so happy AHAHAHA. I’m not trying to force him to LOVE THEM but to at least respect them pic.twitter.com/jZPTEvXdKD
if bts motivates you to keep your grades up, helps you find your dreams, motivates you, sets good example (ex UN speech), gradually show your parents until they feel like the love is deep but also beneficial mentally as well as career-wise. bc parents care about stuff like that
yall act as if all he does is wreck things, when hes literally the fucking LEADER of bts, has given a speech at the UN, and is KIM MF NAMJOON, i have no words. n.o. w.o.r.d.s.
Tried showing BTS to my friends and it took one music video *Mic Drop* and a UN speech to turn them into ARMYs! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/qwG4Qaic4P
BTS: -Held speech on UN -Went to Grammys -Charted not one but twice on BB200 as no 1 & top 10 BB 100 -Is about have stadium tour -Wrote few songs that got them RIAA (and album) -Was named as one of the leaders on new generation by Time If they are not global stars, no one is pic.twitter.com/SgspKC4iEP
I find it really funny tbh like till what extent can they takr a certain group in order to match BTS's level or the popularity rn. Certain things are just impossible like the UN speech and Grammys. People no more view them as a boyband with crazy fans.
Was scrolling through the comments of BTS' UN speech and I'm- what type of no jam is this? pic.twitter.com/dAyBS5cLgp
you know i didn't watch Namjoon's un speech last week before my job interview and i didn't got the job today i watched it and also got the job ugh his power @BTS_twt
oh god I could literally go on and on but I only said what they thought BTS could never get BTS says hi with a Grammy Nom, BBMA award + performance,, AMA award + performance,, PCA, KMA (multiple awards)), Cultural Merit from SK Pres, Grammy Museum interview, UN speech pic.twitter.com/hy2JMO1XOM
Still BTS is actually talented cuz they can dance and rap and actually sing songs that have important messages like loving yourself and talks about corruption in school systems awesome I like your faves BTS has made a speech at the UN
someone please redirect this layman to namjoon's un speech, bts' gender neutral songs, namjoon's macklemore rec, and the fancam of taehyung saying i love you to armys holding up a 'lesbians love bts' sign because they CLEARLY havent done their homework before opening their mouth https://twitter.com/btscryptid/status/1101010225820246016 …
I think the first song I heard was B,S,T during the wings era? It didn’t make me an ARMY. However, for a couple years, I had a respect for them and how revolutionary they were. It wasn’t until their UN speech that I became an ARMY.
Being not able to see each and every update of @BTS_twt for 15 to 20 days was the hardest thing but as a ritual I never ever missed to watch UN speech before going to sleep, that speech is medicine for my confidence and for everything I have been through for past 2 years
don’t forget to include joon’s UN speech
LET'S NOT FORGET BOUT THIS LEGENDARY PRESIDENT KIM NAMJOON'S SPEECH AT UN @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/RF27blwa6U
My daughter was only 10 when she became an army in 2016. RM speech at the UN made me become one too. The message I wanted to transmit to my baby girl is the same, you won't be surprised to hear that she's listening more and acknolewdge it deeper when it comes from our boys
Anyways, I just sent the link of bts’ UN speech to my teacher and I also mentioned the Love Yourself and the End Violence campaign. I’m about to turn my teacher and my whole class into armys pic.twitter.com/5Ma2pk1jzY
armys that found bts bc of the un speech then found the music nd stanned... tru e allies
I know one leader like that - Kim Namjoon of @BTS_twt Watch his speech @UN for proof. @BTSUKUNITE @BTSGlobalNoona @BANGTANUK #SpeakYourselfTour #LOVE_YOURSELF #BTS https://twitter.com/DalaiLama/status/1100704675026747392 …
Joonie,I woke up this morning with a smile on my face knowing that bts kept me happy for more than three years. when I get annoyed on work I always remember the UN speech that you gave and never give up. it’s not my dream job but it assist me financially for my doctorate
i just recited namjoon's un speech in class @BTS_twt
He had a lot or great achievement with his band mates, BTS, such as attending UN with him givinf speech. Kamu bisa cek pidato nya disini https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Today in class , the dr asked who’s your idol in leadership and a girl shouted BTS Kim Namjoon and the dr was like the one who had the UN speech I’ve never been prouder pic.twitter.com/8B3Q7Cy9rH
Maybe you can also print some BTS positive lyrics, those that really encourage. Or some sentences from their interviews. Or you can get an excerpt from RM's UN speech. In a way, youre doing the Love Yourself campaign and at the same time promote BTS. Good luck!!
One thing I forgot to mention we have got a little idea about what #SPEAK_YOURSELF means throught RM's speech in the UN conference, so yeah. @BTS_twt #BTS
@BTS_twt @BigHitEnt @ForSugaForLife Beautiful song which was inspired by RM's speech at the UN https://twitter.com/ForSugaForLife/status/1100389409059352576 …
What I like about this is that people are becoming fans bc of all sorts of things: youtube (recommendations/fbe), bbmas, articles, UN speech, outcast, Twitter tags.... all of those little bits of promo and every event BTS participates in brings in some new fans and that adds up https://twitter.com/paralumanbts/status/1100325173062815744 …
Oh youre same with famous artist in my country. She said that she likes RM because UN speech but idk if she's listen BTS song or nah
I think she meant more like people who stanned BTS after seeing their UN speech? But that’s so cool that ur friend once worked at the UN
i don't even talk about bts to my family , except last year i made my sister listen to them and also made her watch the un speech which she liked then but that's that. there is a reason i don't discuss my fandoms with family
bts really gave a speech at the un general assembly... like... THAT happened. nothing will ever top that
if only he boasted about BTS’ incoming stadium tour, RIAA certificates, UN SPEECH, Two no.1 albums, A top10 hit and etc. https://twitter.com/soompi/status/1100502908599238669 …

kpop industry existed for many years but NOBODY does it like bts. a small company group went to the UN & gave inspiration speech, attended to some major us shows, performed at the amas and bbmas, presenter at the grammys, got daesangs in two different award ceremony in one night.
Before UN: He made a daesang speech UN : He made a SPEECH After UN: HE MADE A DAESANG SPEECH Is it only me who thinks like this about RM? I feel like his words sound powerful in his daesang speeches more than before. The words he use and say. DAMN. @BTS_twt #BTS #KMA #EDailypic.twitter.com/29ZKBoBMwO

As we all know, they had just attended UN last year. And Namjoon's speech touched a lot of ppl, not only armys or koreans but a whole lot of ppl. This time it's not bcos of them as a boyband but bcos of their message. And that's one thing you can only find in BTS.
I’ve always wanted to make a BTS edit with “This Is Me” and then I decided to put some of namjoon’s UN speech at the beginning of it
im howling please check out bts UN Speech and music if you’d like. very good stuff
you don’t know FUCK ALL about them, not each boy individually & especially not what they sing about. you think BTS made a speech at the UN to talk about preteens falling in love & breaking up in 3 days? you’d be fucking dumb to think so.
Bangtan look like big people. You know how Jungkook described Joon when he was giving the UN Speech? I feel like that right now when they just walked to receive the award @BTS_twt
Why do you called BTS a nugu group when they were on a front page of TIME magazine, gave a speech at the freaking UN, sold out US stadiums for 4 days straight- these are not actions of a nugu group. These are actions of a legendary group.

we gonna ignore the fact that bts’ comeback is probably april 26 & the name of the album will probably be speak yourself? because #ARMYPEDIA⁠ ⁠has dates until april 26th & #SAVE_ME ends on april 25. they named a tour speak yourself & joon said speak yourself in the un speech.
@BTS_twt Namjin be really living like this huh Why do you look like your about to do a speech for UN https://twitter.com/gingerol95/status/1100185371906895873 …
My most favorite speech next to the UN one
I love their music but it’s not enough bc I can become just casual listener. The thing push me stan BTS is Namjoon, his UN speech blew my mind. And of course I found many many reasons to love them more and more after^^
Translations exist. It's not 1900's where you'd find very few translators. BTS went to the UN to deliver a speech. BTS has a whole moment to end violence. Supporting tr*mp means you indirectly support violence and hate. Period.
Show them the UN speech, the performances, all the good things BTS did!! Good luck Ash
Guys quick useful links to introduce someone to @BTS_twt ( I already put UN speech) what else can I add??
i can't believe bts sold 2 million albums each with tear & answer, held a speech at the un, had 62 PAKS i with FK, earned 13 daesangs, performed at the bbmas, had a stadium concert, held a world tour, charted on hot100 multiple times, dominate the world pic.twitter.com/K38R2Tnd7x
Revisiting even the embarrasing and awful moments of BTS past only makes me think about Namjoon’s UN speech but maybe im just looking at these Armypedia quizzes with an optimistic eye pic.twitter.com/2XgsiOQL8T
maybe if they watched bts's un speech pic.twitter.com/vPnElmRYmP
stream navillera and bts's un speech https://twitter.com/SvintGeek/status/1099863479610105856 …
never forget BTS gave a speech at the UN General Assembly speech, only legends

You do know we only correct the articles with the kpop label connected if it's fitting. They call bts kpop all the time but we usually dont correct it. Now say if you make a headline saying first kpop group to make a UN speech or present at Grammys
Now if the headlines said "BTS is the first group to make a UN speech" it would be better and is BTSpop bec only BTS can do that and were able to do that bec theyre UNICEF ambassadors and doesnt have anything to do with kpop
BTS>>>gives UN speech>>>headlines say first kpop group to make UN speech implying it's possible and easy for kpop groups to give a UN speech when literally not even long time diplomats can do so >>>makes it seem like their achievement is simple and limited
soooo you mean to say Kim Namjoon-ssi delivered those inspiring and motivational speech at the UN with SafetyPins on his back & shoulders?!??!? #LoveYourself #LoveMyself #SpeakYourself #iLoveYou @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/p9ptcTUj8H
anyways one of my irl friend who hates kpop is a namjoon solo stan hhh he saw their UN speech and then fall in love with namjoon’s voice and hair .he showed me his youtube history full with bts interviews the buzzfeed ellen show hhh
who would've known that he had safety pins at the back of his shirt during his UN speech that made him extra fine @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/XMKaDkJKmh
my own sister just said to me to not send her bts videos(never sent her just shown her a few) out of the blue after i told her to never send me ticktoc vids like some ppl do ._. she said she liked joon's un speech wtf :|
puta. i was rewriting notes while listening to BTS UN speech and i was supposed to write 7 transmembrane but instead i wrote “seven member BT—” i cant with me pic.twitter.com/l5gLHgOxg2
This is That guy who has speech in UN #RM @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/1kYXD02H5Y
I suddenly remember that mocha uson was also in un where bts delivered their wonderful speech, like-
What makes me so brave to speak out my opinions? Regarding kpop,bts or in what situations. Thanks to RM @BTS_twt . He convinced me that not matter what speak ur self. U can’t let others to have negative thoughts on you Watch RM speech at UN if you still dont
Like I said I’m only going to post a memory I had because of them. Could be the day of the UN speech or like I said just a day that I remember listen or watching them helped me
Nah it's okay. It's just that gg stans called me xenophpbic for saying bts is in another league and that speaking at the UN is something that no other group can do given that not even diplomats and activists can give a speech there.
Wait wait wait... Do you remembee Namjoon's speech at UN?! He've said these kind of question if i don't remember wrong What could it mean?
Thank you for Jin Charmander for the compilation video of Jin Singing triple high note. Unicef for the UN Speech of RM And for the BTS members showing love and support with one another, making it all happen. Thank you! I purple you all @BTS_twt
Very beautiful speech at @UN by #NamjoonKim #BTS about loving who you are. #WorldPeace requires #InnerPeace. @UNICEF Please share! @BarbraStreisand @yokoono @PaulMcCartney @ringostarrmusic @cher @DollyParton @MileyCyrus @ladygaga @ArianaGrande @ygofficialblink
Yes and his un speech how can we forget that they came from a small company ? Like every related thing is connected they ain’t playing this time when joonie says 2019 will be bts year
This is very insulting and ignorant. There are many groups besides bts that have a lot of things to say, but haven't been given the spotlight or opportunity. To say no other group could give a UN speech means you believe these other groups have nothing to say or stand for.
Wait - so the set list can be a complete journey from the beginning until the Love Yourself era and they gonna play the UN speech in the beginning???? @BTS_twt
i tried to explain that BTS don’t want just money that they really care about the fans and told her that Namjoon did write the UN speech by himself now she’s silent hah
Namjoon's speech at the UN led me to BTS. Kim Namjoon not only impressed,he overwhelmed me.Two words came to mind 'World Leader'.The clarity of thoughts, his convictions, his passion reflected HIM. Looked him up, heard other rappers,read BTS lyrics, saw their dances & was hooked
BTS do have a habit of naming tours after albums but not always. Speak Yourself could very well be just a song off the album or be in the form of Skit: Speak Yourself (UN Speech). It does seem obvious that the album will be “Speak Yourself” but I wonder if that’s to throw us off
I'm up for someone with height of 181cm, husky voice, broad shoulders, speak English fluently, have done speech in the UN, lot of credits from his own writed songs, and still so many things else and yes, that's our President Kim Namjoon aka RM
Im loving this retreat. My retreat master in our session this morning just said, "GROW YOURSELF AND GROUND YOURSELF, THATS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW OUR TRUE SELVES?" She volounters for the UN by giveing talks like this ons , I wanna ask if she heard @BTS_twt's speech for UN.
Kim Namjoon. UN Speech. Time’s New Generation of Leaders. South Korea’s youngest recipient of Order of Cultural Merit. Only group with KMA daesang. Grammy presenter. Awarded by MTV, AMA, BBMAs. BB200 2x. Songwiter. Producer. Inspired millions to love themselves. Kim Namjoon. pic.twitter.com/duxNBpPVHR
BTS are different than most people that's because their music is powerful of course they're not going to be like any other group not any other group has made a speech at the UN in front of thousands of politicians not any artist r a Ambassador for their country they're successful
i can't believe it's been 5 months since bts held their speech at the un, became unicef ambassadors and were named one of the most influential activists and next generation leaders pic.twitter.com/e2RHZBwO5K
24 here and if this isnt me and my mom... even tho she admitted a lot of times that bts is really special & cried at magic shop and their UN speech, she still makes fun of me BUT i don't give a damn cause i spend MY money and MY free time the way I want period
So I was thinking of ways to lure her further into the fandom and thought of sharing the UN Speech. I rewatched it before sending and ended up crying again. Each time I rewatch his speech it sheds a newer light and a deeper meaning for me. Namjoon is so amazing. @BTS_twt
I can't remember mine specifically, but it was a quote from their UN speech
I started stanning them just a few months ago when I read somewhere the speech they had in UN and definitely stan them because of their music and their lyrics are always hearfelt. They are indeed a legend and talented. There's no doubt that BTS is the first Kpop group that I stan
i remembered when i was still a casual fan. i just love bopping to mic drop. tae had me there!! then i just noticed how i always search for bts on my search engine, then felt so proud during UN speech, then i decided that i should make my own stan acct pic.twitter.com/JkrN2RT67Y
so an english teacher in our school shared namjoon's speech at the UN and said he admired his words he is not an army but he recognizes the message that bts wants to deliver and i think that's beautiful @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/rCFe52pjXL
yesterday, i finally told my mom about bts and me liking them, openly. i showed her Namjoon’s speech at the UN. suprisingly, she didn’t get mad and that was the first achievement for myself. more to come, mom. more. HAHAHA
#ARMY and @BTS_twt already made a lot of movements in society with #UNICEF campaigns, #ENDviolence, #LoveMyself, #UN speech and many more. The most important part of movements is @BTS_twt music that speaks so deep and saves many lives. This is only the beginning
I sent him the hardships video on YT. Dunno if he watched it. But he was someone who couldn't stand BTS before but started respecting them after the UN speech..I guess that's a progress!
Since #SPEAK_YOURSELF seems to be the theme for next comeback, does that mean @BTS_twt will add Joonie’s UN speech as a skit in their next album? pic.twitter.com/9kptcBO3EA
BTS members' memory: 13-06-13 Jimin's was their debut 31-12-13 V's was their debut year 21-08-14 RM's was their 1st TV debut 07-05-16 Jin's was their 1st KSPO Dome concert 10-12-17 Jungkook's was the final Wings concert 02-05-18 J-Hope's 1st mixtape 24-09-18 Suga's was UN speech
thank u for the article but @BTS_twt launched #BTSLoveMyself campaign w UNICEF in 2017 (Nov. 1st), not 2018 u said namjoon's UN speech (Sep, 2018) was the campaign start, but we were congratulating 1 yr anniversary in Nov. 2018 already https://www.soompi.com/article/1184317wpp/unicef-thanks-bts-raising-1-million-love-campaign …
The "Love Myself" campaign did not start after the UN speech too.. the thought of it or the concept already even before UN speech

Check out BTS UN Speech wgich was written by speaker by himself ( he quoted there the lyrics from their multiple songs ) and repeat how overrated they are again Before judging check out their discography, preferably with english subs to get the whole beauty and importance of
Hssbsh I hate that I had to cut off some part of BTS’ achievements bc 280 characters ain’t letting me complete it I would’ve included Cultural Merit, UN Speech & more but anyways hhhhh
Hey there. @BTS_twt is a South Korean group who was nominated for grammys best recording package with their album LOVE YOURSELF:TEAR. Recently they attended UN and gave speech regarding love yourself. Here's a glimpse of that speech. pic.twitter.com/12ylO4UKMt
Awwww that’s when they gave their UN Speech :’) pic.twitter.com/CxTZ05UX8z
Difference is ARMYs were there for BTS even before the UN speech or GRAMMYS or whatever. We grew steadily & hit all the goals one by one together. We don't just go where the grass seems greener. We already cultivated our own and watered it together. The results are right there.
Haha don’t worry, the guy jhope is part of a seven member group from Korea called BTS, they gave a speech last year at the UN. You should also check out some of their songs, they r very passionate about their craft and take part in the writing and production of most of their +

adminT says RM will have the intro ! I say that this was a hint ! The last intro he did was ORUL82 It’s time ! Yes ! Plus speak yourself was hallmark of his UN speech! Another clue!! (I hope I’m right ) #SpeakYourselfTour @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSchPL_board/status/1073803574415687680 …
Omg! What's happening?! My cousin, who doesn't like kpop just messaged me saying she fell inlove with Namjoon's voice during his UN speech (which I just shared on my personal fb acc) and now she's checking them out on YT?!! @BTS_twt #ThePowerOfBTS
i know that date and will be my favorite memory of my life for that day it was their UN speech day. the same day of my BD. i will not forget this day @BTS_twt #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #BTSARMYhttps://twitter.com/armypedia_help/status/1098826106810101760 …
@narendramodi sir you are in Seoul now please meet @BTS_twt and bring them to India they got much influence in Indian Army's (fans) they are the one who gave a speech in UN general assembly and ambassador's of @UNICEF BTS also doing #endviolence and #loveyourself campaign
Yoongi's memory is last year's UN speechan unforgettable moment in history @BTS_twt #ARMYPEDIA
The fact that UN speech was on my birthday. Let’s talk about a good b-day gift.
Yoongi's teaser is The big day indeed... The speech at UN was definitely a special day... #Armypedia @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/snOGIMQt3t
September 24th, 2018 - @BTS_twt at UN as UNICEF Ambassadors and gave their speech, 'Speak Yourself' pic.twitter.com/4Ngpc3t8Ps
The dates are meaningful dates of BTS like JK’s billboard is Dec. 10, 2017 when the final Wings tour concert was held in Seoul. Yoongi is Sep. 24, 2018 for UN speech. We have to find 2,080 days and compile our memories with BTS in Armypedia

Great example was their VCR in every MAMA or MMA intro performance about Love yourself album, then face yourself..then his speech at the UN press "Speak Yourself" *brilliant mind*indeed
Yeah and its not the first time, remember that he mention the next Love Yourself series in UN speech, with very clearly message "Speak Yourself"
I think a good way to summarize BTS's success is explaining that the new addition of dates of their stadium tour is named after a speech their leader gave at the UN.
So this book that I am currently reading is motivational and it’s name is “I Can Do It!”.I have never read this kind of books before,but thanks to BTS and there inspiring speech at UN I started to believe in myself and love myself #ARMYLoveMyself #BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/0vfPjEVHvV
I remember sending joon's un speech to my mom and even tho we talked about it through the chat and her saying that it's beautiful and that she cried i-i felt that :(( i was bursting with happiness cuz i never expected this kind of convo with her esp when it's about @BTS_twt
wasn't the un speech on the the 24th? Or am I just hella confused
<During meeting prior to UN speech> Suga: "Just because they’re the fans of idols they get belittled but they are extraordinary people. This is not something anyone can do just because you like them." Remember this? :( @BTS_twt #iHeartAwards #BTSArmy #bestfanarmy

I thought it was necessary a translation of this : People aaaaaa The deciphered code is: "Smile and say cheese" And the date is September 25, 2018 the day Namjoon made the speech at the UN Now the number above must be the piece number( 1931) #ARMYPEDIA @BTS_twt @BigHitEnthttps://twitter.com/Sorrisos_for_me/status/1098672980857634816 …
Next step is drop namjoon's un speech and let them write bts's impact to the economy
Our teacher loved bts after we shows him the UN speech
i’m gonna watch bts’s un speech because they taught me to love myself
bts: gives explicit support to the lgbt community, writes lgbt songs, includes “no matter your gender identity” in a UN speech, etc kpoppies: girl group member: wears a rainbow dress kpoppies: https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/266036172122365952 …
if bts only like popular on sns bcoz fans make them trending, its fine with social artist nominee but they already prove that they are more than that ! #1 on charts not only in USA but all over the world, stadium tour, un speech, etc, they should be nominated as best group !
BTS really hinted at their next era in a UN speech pic.twitter.com/oJjbYxDPJ0
That's because I reveluv literally did that. They downplayed and invalidated all the explicit support bts have shown for lgbt (Ex 1: the UN speech), but hyped up Yeri just picking up the flag. Like I'm sure she's done more than that, but being a hypocrite isn't okay
Today at school my teacher played RM’s speech at UN and Idol on broadcast. Let’s just say ya girl was fangirling in class. My teacher is an Army lol. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/pdXEGGbt8Q
Spread the Army love yesterday telling school Inspectors about Namjoon's UN speech and their positive influence on students. @AloraChicoria @BTSUKUNITE @BTS_twt #LOVE_YOURSELF #BTS
BTS is gonna have stadium concerts with capacity of almost 100k, attended the Grammys, gave a speech in UN, and companies see them as part of mainstream pop culture. This doesnt have the streams and sales. They keep on having this onesided competition with BTS it's so funny https://twitter.com/bIuesidebabe/status/1098376576817758208 …
so writing gender neutral lyrics, encouraging other to be themselves ( including the lgbt+ ) recommending same-sex songs , uses bf and gf, even said ‘no matter your gender identity’ in his UN speech isn’t supporting the lgbt+ ?? y’all either silent or y’all just hate bts just bc
Actor Lee Deok Hwa mentioned @BTS_twt on YouTube Mentioned about BTS UN speech, wishes to go fishing with Jin #BTS #방탄소년단 https://twitter.com/gingerol95/status/1098229715041546240/video/1 …
'I don't get enough time to live as Kim Namjoon' - Burn The Stage 'I am Kim Namjoon and also, RM of BTS' - UN Speech what if, the next album is BTS stripping away their stage personas and *for once* being THEMSELVES, wholeheartedly.
Just realized namjoon mentioned speaking yourself in his UN speech and now the new tour is called speak yourself #bts #speakyourself
Ok so yall know their concerts are named after their albums and speak yourself is after their UN speech right? What if its not a concert but BTS are doing motivational ted talks across the globe? Bitch I still wanna go @BTS_twt
when comparing bts to most western artists yes, they seem more informed and educated about the topic (un speech for example) but i think the phrase should go “if you want to stan some1 who isn’t into politics stan the rest of kpop” lol
@BRISxLIFE you know bts finna drop an album better than Love Yourself Tear. Right? And it's called Speak Yourself. I'm calling it out before it drops. Title Speak Yourself. If you don't believe me. Go back and watch the UN speech with BTS
I love the fact that he increased people's awareness on global issues @BTS_twt 's Namjoon, now i see why he's choosen to be giving the speech at the UN's he is truly one of the most outstanding guy i ever seen in this world. I respect his passion so much
bts scheduled the UN speech on september 24th knowing it was my birthday ugh i love them and they love me
my mom used to not support me liking bts until i showed her the UN speech y’all eye- pic.twitter.com/noAeSiQ0NL
Am comparatively new ARMY. Never thought corporate world would bring something so beautiful & meaningful. During some work related surfing, came across a tweet by an ABC anchor criticizing Namjoon's speech in the UN. I interact with ppl at UNICEF, UN & other NGOs so was curious.
Thats you with literally every gg but then when bts talks abt gender identity at UN speech, yoongi says that "everyone's equal and there's no problem being lgbt", and they show multiple times they support the community and have no prejudice agaist it yal talk sh!t, just stfu https://twitter.com/Iovesevil/status/1098266076197068800 …
Namjoons UN speech was so inspiring! Also BST is one if them BOP songs you did have a great start in this fandom!! @BTS_twt #BTSTourInINDIA
By watching namjoon's speech at UN and by watching mv of blood sweat and tears @BTS_twt #BTSTourInINDIA
Namjoom oppa We love you sooo much You've help me when i most needed You don't know but your speech at UN change my whole perspective of thinking Thank you sooo much for coming in my life Please come to India @BTS_twt #BTSTourInINDIApic.twitter.com/0HM4GIbjVp
BTS, A seven member band from South Korea who performed their hit single 'Fake Love' at the 2018 BBMAS & also won the top social artist award. They gave a speech at the UN in Sept. 2018. They also presented an award at this year's Grammys. #BTSTourInINDIApic.twitter.com/kk2ftccsuA
I became an army in 2018 after the idol mv came. I wasn't into bts but then I watched Namjoon's speech in the UN and I was so touched. I watched them having fun in videos and I liked how they were very down to earth and very humble and that's how I fell in love with them+
hi i've just popped back on to address this real quick. bts are not a political group. don't pull them into politics. they are a KPOP group. yes, they have done things like the UN speech but that was THEIR choice. don't drag them into things they didn't sign up for. pic.twitter.com/6yijxIbs3c
Rosan namjoon gave hints during his UN speech. He said something about speaking up for yourself. Like how two years ago he gave hints at the BBMAs by saying love yourself.
ONLY BTS WOULD USE COMEBACK HINTS AT A UN SPEECH UGH IM SO MAD LDFKJSDAK; https://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/1097873494849740801 …
i’d love to flex and brag abt bts’ achievements in the tl but 280 characters aren’t enough for it all how am i supposed to say theyre the only kartist to be two-time bbma winners, amas performers, grammy-nominated presenters, unicef ambassadors who gave a speech at the un,,,
Drag queen Kim Chi joined the long list of celebrities who stan BTS with this recent photo of her in a fabulous purple dress! read the article: https://bit.ly/2SPPLBQ Also when #BTS showed support for the LGBTQ community in a UN speech: https://bit.ly/2SKAGlX @BTS_ARMYpic.twitter.com/g9lRIkXCb3
Yeah. My email to my dad was lengthy. I didn’t even touch on the BTS universe. I did start him off by sending him the UN Speech.
okay rant over lmaooo im so done w her jdjsksksks when my teacher played bts's UN speech in class all she could say was that she hated them and that they looked bad OK SIS LET ME KNOW WHEN YOUR FAVES GIVE A SPEECH AT THE UN
Full analysis of RM's speech at the UN is here, if you'd like to read the entire thing: @BTS_twt https://drive.google.com/file/d/15madTlUQWevFAlNXsUkN_te1RB7Jtdg9/view?usp=sharing …
As I thought about today's announcement and how far BTS has come, this paragraph from my analysis of RM's speech at the UN came to mind. I'm so happy for @BTS_twt and ARMY. Let's continue to make a beautiful galaxy of experience together. #SPEAK_YOURSELF pic.twitter.com/fg67ekpogR

When I heard that UN speech I just knew speak yourself was going to be next
I don't know why they made speak yourself concert.We already know that since the speech at the UN,Namjoon talked about speakYourself and we guessed it will be a new album.but this concert is still LY,so we are still in the LYera? hasn't changed era? #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xtAmRqWusB
Leave it to freakin Namjoon to reveal a concept at his damn UN speech! Legends only! MIC DROP. (cause your fave WILL never - but they’re still super cool).
I’m really into the arrow and heart Speak Yourself design, it’s great to see the UN speech theme as a refrain on tour! I feel confident the comeback concept will be inventive and new since BTS are using this as their victory lap theme. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/aYBnn38DWA
I had the #SPEAK_YOURSELF in my bio of my other personal account ever since RMs speech at the UN last year. Now the hashtag is actually real and is linked with the boys new tour and album #BTS @BTS_twt
This has actually got me thinking really hard hmm... Did Namjoon hint on next title of album in the UN speech? Was that the first hint of the new album? Or was there more before? Thoughts? #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt #BTS #LOVE_YOURSELFhttps://twitter.com/Jeff__Benjamin/status/1097889139503124482 …
UN speech imaginario pic.twitter.com/BTtEWsHpSV
Not @bts for literally hinting at their next tour name in Namjoons UN speech, they way ahead of the game
BTS’ new album will probably be called #SPEAK_YOURSELF and will include the UN speech as a skit. Release date could be April 26, which means pre orders should drop late March so I have about a month to save up.
okay but;; you can really tell the UN speech is one of their proudest moments..... and I bet it'll include things from the next comeback♡
Since finding out about @BTS_twt new tour is called #SPEAK_YOURSELF, I wanted to show my phone bg! I am moved by Namjoon's UN speech & when I found this I had to use it! My wallpaper & lockscreen! #BTS pic.twitter.com/fCzBZ61Xrs
so like fuck the entire speech joon gave at the un explaining what “speak yourself” means, huh? ur really trying to clown bts for 2 retweets over an issue that’s close to them because APPARENTLY speak yourself sounds embarrassing. grow up pls. https://twitter.com/theconfusedkat/status/1097888509334036480 …
Sooooo, Speak Yourself was kind of the theme for the UN speech... Does that mean they knew their new concept and album title and everything back then?! How long ago did they plan this #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt
i knew it that when RM said in the UN speech that "now we have learned to love ourselves so now i urge you to speak yourself " i knew this was coming but none noticed
THOSE WHO CLOWNED JOON'S ENGLISH DURING HIS UN SPEECH SAYING #SPEAK_YOURSELF IS WRONG, AND CORRECTING HIS SPEECH WITH "Speak for yourself" I HOPE YOU ALL CHOKE. Speak Yourself is a world stadium tour concept for BTS in 2019 and Kim Namjoon spoke about it in Sept 2018.
Hi, thanks for asking! BTS are a South Korean group that makes & self-produces their own socially-conscious music. They spread messages of hope & encouragement globally & even work w @UNICEF. Please check out their incredible speech at the @UN! :) pic.twitter.com/tpKGihIxKS
Since you are here... Hmmm... Maybe check out their songs not only their news? And also, their UN speech.. It is inspiring..
President Kim Namjoon UN speech leaded to the New BTS era #SPEAK_YOURSELF
Waking up to more twts re #LOVE_YOURSELF #SPEAK_YOURSELF TOUR and realizing that based on what @BTS_twt were telling in interviews, vlive and even in the UN speech, they knew this all along. This is well thought out. Well played, @BigHitEnt. https://twitter.com/RollingStone/status/1097910459989135360 …
Have I ever told any of you how much I hate One Direction fans like really they think that theyre better than Army for absolutely no reason like literally our boys have made a speech at the UN BTS went to the Grammys our boys are so great they turn down performing at the Olympics
After RM's speech at the UN i made a post on my IG and there is written 'Speak yourself' .. what is happening.?? THEY FOR SURE WANT TO KILL MY BROKE ass..
Namjoon told us during the UN Speech pic.twitter.com/uUGVxbgBRn
And I was waiting for this, from the time RM uttered it at the UN speech
#SPEAK_YOURSELF resonated with me so much during the UN speech. I’m so excited to see how our boys explore the concept and expand on the Love Yourself theme. So proud of them. We’re getting a whole new era, fam. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KLlXVixbiq
BTS stadium tour except it’s just namjoon’s UN speech #SPEAK_YOURSELF
So many locals and celebrities will attend @BTS_twt stadium tour oof more people will fall in love with them, UN speech and Grammys did the work and now we will see the results
Namjoon at the UN : Speak Yourself ! Army : we KNOW that the next album is gonna be related with Speak Yourself, we ain't beginners anymore @BTS_twt : Stadium tour, #SPEAK_YOURSELF Army : what??? Speak Yourself??? like in the UN speech??? really??? pic.twitter.com/rEuRp4dREp
BTS: Presenting on the Grammys, Stadium tour with capacities of 90k, Appearing on the time magazine cover as next generation leaders , Giving a speech in front of world leaders on the UN, K : pop
Did Namjoon just hinted us with #SPEAK_YOURSELF on his UN speech? Could this really be and possibly be the new era?!? Let’s all suffer together! @BTS_twt #ProudBTSArmyMompic.twitter.com/ijYDMafDvU
Raise your hand if you knew President Namjoon’s UN speech definitely related to later @BTS_twt content... #SPEAK_YOURSELF
SKIT: BTS UN Speech “Speak Yourself” #SPEAK_YOURSELF #LOVE_YOURSELF @BTS_twt
My mom is understandable,she supports me.she knows why I listen to BTS, she knows they been such a huge help with my depression before and etc...we now and then talk about them...I showed her the UN speech and omg..she said so many nice things about the boys it +
Just the name of BTS first stadium tour and the message Namjoon shared in his UN speech PERIODT
I can't beleive @BTS_twt really dropped a comeback hint in their UN speech LEGENDS
I have collected my thoughts. @BTS_twt sprinkled us with stadium tour dates for #LOVE_YOURSELF: #SPEAK_YOURSELF world tour. RM hinted "SPEAK YOURSELF" all the way back from the UN speech. It is now a part of this tour. A new revelation for their upcoming comeback?! I'm not ready.
So we’re all gonna hear a dramatic reading of the UN speech live huh. Buying front row tix
RM hinted it during his UN speech #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt I believe this https://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/1097873519814164480 …
THE COMEBACK TEASER WAS IN A UN SPEECH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE I’M .... AND YOONGI WANTED A STADIUM TOUR! IT’S HAPPENING 2019! @BTS_twt #LOVE_YOURSELF #SPEAK_YOURSELFpic.twitter.com/FptCub9JyQ
showed the bts un speech to my leadership class for my presentation and only my professor knew who they were https://twitter.com/koosite/status/1084494617599369217/video/1 …
Yeah, I knew RM’s UN speech on that day was definitely the clue for next comeback album. After watching his speech, I said, “Speak Yourself could be the hint of the next album!”
When BTS use their UN Speech as a foreshadow and an ultimate global advertisement #SPEAK_YOURELFpic.twitter.com/02oOj81hKs
When @BTS_twt comes to BBMAs,AMA,MAMA,MMA & other award shows, we remind ourselves to pay attention to their every interview, intro vcr, winning speech, signal on clothes, & gestures to find hints for next concept. We just can't expect them dropping hint #SPEAK_YOURSELF at UN
BTS will be doing a stadium tour with 90k capacity and the ticket selling is next week already... yet people are still worried they won’t get tickets... plus the tour name is based on their UN speech... NOBODY FLEXES LIKE BTS @BTS_twt #SPEAK_YOURSELF
Wow, after RM's speech in the UN.... I had posted saying the next album will have something to do with the phrase 'SPEAK YOURSELF'. And voila !! here it is.... @BigHitEnt just dropped the same on YouTube No, I'm not intelligent please !!
Is it just me or did anyone else figure out that they were hinting this tour since the speech at the UN #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Kbga13t5xM
Love Yourself Face Yourself Speak Yourself Jadi mereka ngasih spoiler lewat UN speech? :') @BTS_twt #SPEAK_YOURSELF
OHMYGOD THEY REALLY SPOILED THE NEW TOUR WAY BACK DURING THEIR UN SPEECH (WHICH, CRAZY!!) AND NO ONE HAD A SINGLE CLUE WE RLY HAHDJSJDB #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt
The brains working on their projects are amazing. The way they link everything, EVERYTHING! Even the UN Speech. It’s unbelievable.
LISTEN!! NO LIE i was busy writing a speech to hold in front of my class in english where i'd mention @BTS_twt and namjoons inspiring Speak Yourself speech at the UN and NOW THEY'RE HAVING A TOUR CALLED #SPEAK_YOURSELF ??????
what if the comeback name was BECAUSE of the un speech I’m betting our president NAMED this legend tour without even knowing it THIS KING
i got goosebump after realise that bts comeback was hiding inside the UN speech wtf
A COMEBACK REVEALED IN A UN SPEECH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE. L E G E N D S @BTS_twt #BTS #방탄소년단 #LOVE_YOURSELF #SPEAK_YOURSELF
First at @billboard, and now UN. We better watch every Namjoon's speech to get hints. #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/Jeff__Benjamin/status/1097889139503124482 …
Would it be asking too much for the 1st song on the new album to be respectively titled #SPEAK_YOURSELF and it just be Namjoon's UN speech @BTS_twt
Just wait until they include RM's speech at the #UN as the skit in their next album. #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt
So the @UN speech was the first hint... @BTS_twt reveal the first stadium dates for their 'Love Yourself: Speak Yourself' world tour! See more information in the tour poster and here: http://youtu.be/r-uN2VzsfXU #BTS #방탄소년단 #LOVE_YOURSELF #SPEAK_YOURSELFpic.twitter.com/ZZSGCLnbNy
@BTS_twt I knew the new album would be called SPEAK YOURSELF cuz Namjoon mentioned it so many times in hus UN speech SKSKSKSKSD I AM SO EXCITED ...I AM DYING OUT OF THIS EXCITEMENT #BTSARMY #BTS #LOVE_YOURSELF #SPEAK_YOURSELFpic.twitter.com/yMaxLoz0WC
IS THE NEXT SERIES ACTUALLY 'SPEAK YOURSELF' then? Was @BTS_twt UN speech a hint like we all thought? @KpopTuner Tanz see this...a FULL STADIUM TOUR IN US AND EUROPE this tour is gonna have 1.5 M attendees I can feel it already...gosh!! who is even doing it like them?
yeah im pretty there are enough seats for armys but sadly yall gotta fight scalpers too.. ooo i cant wait for the new album!! im guessing joon's UN speech speak yourself will be inside like the bbmas skit
Remember the UN speech? Namjoon mentioned it, right there.
Sometimes I wish that one day I can meet you guys because you are the only people that make me want to do something in life and your music makes me excited, happy, and joyful. Your music has made me the person I am and your speech at the UN has boosted me to speak myself. Ily.
@BTS_twt You are living out your UN speech? #RM tell me boy! Are you boomeranging back to us ???? Is that why you didn't do a day 2 in SG????? Our day 2 in SG is #SPEAK_YOURSELF ?? #BTSMania #BTSARMY #BTS
Also I’m so impressed by this subtitle “Speak Yourself”. I recalled the speech script by RM for UN. BTS taught us that “Love Yourself, Love Myself”. In addition, he taught us that “Speak Yourself” too. They express this important concept by having additional tour...Love you BTS
OK so can we just talk about the fact that BTS announced their next tour which is Speak Yourself and some ARMYs said after the UN speech that the next album is gonna be Speak Yourself like are we even human
BTS are unprecedented and incomparable i- y’all see all the BIG big things theyre doing? 113 weeks at no #1 top social artist on Billboard, gold & platinum albums n singles, giving a speech at the UN, attending the grammys, having shows in stadiums with 80,000 to 100,000 armys. i pic.twitter.com/nHFQ46oqDM
MY FAVES ARE NAMING THEIR NEW SERIES AFTER THEIR SPEECH AT THE UN #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt WHAT ARE YOUR FAVES DOING? QUICKLY
Ahh... Thank you for the giveaway ^^ Here is my inspirational quote. It's from BTS UN speech. "Find your name, find your voice by speaking yourself."
From UN speech to sma they only talking about speak yourself. I think it's related to new album
Imagine drop your hint on UN speech,... @BTS_twt #SPEAK_YOURSELFpic.twitter.com/0A4ONIX650
Recovering from the shock..It really is Speak Yourself which RM pertained to in his UN speech. when’s the ph leg??? Waaaah #SPEAK_YOURSELF #BTS #LOVE_YOURSELFhttps://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/1097873494849740801 …
We called it during UN speech.
BTS were giving spoilers in the UN speech, their power
My gut feel aftr UN speech said #SPEAK_YOURSELF would be the next album. If it is, i cnt imagine how epic it would be. The message the impact it’s gonna be more meaningful @BTS_twt
I think it related to un speech
As what ARMYS expected Namjoon already hinted us abt #SPEAK_YOURSELF during UN speech like there's nothing is coincidence in this house now the 12am is back I missed this @BTS_twt #BTS https://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/1097873494849740801 …
Imagine dropping your next album name at the UN while simultaneously delivering a high impact speech BTS ONLY
I KNEW IT!!!!!!! The UN speech reference was going to come back and IT ISSSSSS pic.twitter.com/A1KqP8GDg4
Since the UN speech , we knew it was a hint all along. LOVE YOURSELF: #SPEAK_YOURSELF @BTS_twt
This is the same guy who gave speech in UN, the same guy who received Cultural Merit Award, the same guy who presented an award in Grammys and ofc the same guy who lead the biggest boyband. He is PRESIDENT KIM NAMJOON #PresidentsDay @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/COpDTcFECx
Imagine laying beside Kim Namjoon in bed and he talks to you in this calm, soft voice, telling you that you should love you because he loves you :) the UN speech was really that bitch
Today, we talked about bts in class and discussed their role to play as influencers of the younger minds. Someone brought up their UN speech and how it drove a powerful message of loving yourself; through your mistakes and mishaps, learning from them and growing to +
#RunBTSep64 "Ah, BTS. You mean these Korean singers who did this amazing UN speech and with that cool stage performance?" Me: *sweats nervously* Y-Yes... pic.twitter.com/KmW9Ahcsou
ah right i wanted to let yall know i presented in front of the class today with my speech and i included about BTS speaking at the UN at the introduction. Yall my classmates where surprised when i talked about them for a topic about social issues
Part of Namjoons UN speech So let’s take all one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself. I’d like to ask all of you, What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? Tell me your story. @BTS_twt #PresidentsDay
Part of Namjoons UN speech And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’ll be me too. @BTS_twt #PresidentsDay
He's not an actual president yet, he's Kim Namjoon or RM, the leader of bts. He has a beautiful mindset and encourages people to love themselves and fight for their dreams, so for ARMYs, he sould be president. Here's is dome of the video of your screenshot, his speech at the UN: pic.twitter.com/JG2maZ2PRb
sometimes i forget THE kim namjoon delivered a speech at THE UN and that's... wow i'm so amazed and proud @BTS_twt
Hello from . I guess you've officially realized you opened Pandora's Box, right? LOL! I'm pretty close to 50 and part of this ARMY. Love Springsteen too. These 7 guys took me by surprise and now I'm hooked. The power of @BTS_twt! BTS UN Speech https://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak pic.twitter.com/1zmvrFJq3P
Ok..so..i took my second sis to see the movie loveyourself in seoul. Shes now a fan. Jin and Tae bias. I just played the UN speech for my oldest sis who was teasing her.. lol and shE CRIED!! Said shes soooo proud!!! @BTS_twt
This is Kim Namjoon, a member of the Korean boygroup BTS who’s also their leader, and it’s an inside joke with ARMYS (fandom name) calling him the President especially after his UN speech.
all respect to my president kim namjoon and this incredible speech he did at the UN,, my biggest pride #PresidentsDay @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/fm8MjZEfCJ
this is why bts is exploring the whole embodiment of loving yourself, while this UN speech it's amazing, their music lyrics are even better. I think it's important to have genuine people like them talking about self-love and encourage others to have an opinion, a voice.
We should all listen to Kim Namjoon's UN speech every day. His vision really can change us to make us stronger & better and therefore change the world !! It is not just his genius IQ but his huge heart we need. #PresidentsDay @BTS_twt #PresidentKimNamjoon #RMusicpic.twitter.com/xhVv9Dm4wB
okay, but how was their UN convention speech?
It’s #PresidentsDay so I feel we must put our President’s most famous UN speech back on the tl Kim namjoon. Our president @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/lMRw54jXma
Please go watch this video. It is so heartwarming and such a lovely addition to our fandom content. Dad And Sister React To BTS UN Speech And Introductions https://youtu.be/m8tjrd-2slk via @YouTube @BTS_twt
You guys can’t take opinions about bts seriously if they’re from bts antis, ofc theyre gonna make sht up. Someone was literally quoting an acct talking about bts’ music and It was the acct who got thousands of likes clowning joons un speech
Hi there. @BTS_twt are a group of 7 Korean artists. Their leader, RM, gave a speech at the UN last year and they presented at the GRAMMYs last week. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
The word constellation cams up in my readings was about to google it but then I remembered Joon’s UN speech @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/jfszn9ihPg
I have been taking anti-psychotics and going to therapy, but last October, my friend made me listen to Namjoon’s speech at the UN and it hit home. I started listening to BTS’ music and I realized I was healing faster than expected.
@BTS_twt helped me in my dark times. They have great music, great personality and kind souls. You should listen to their UN speech. They promote self love which is very important in everyone's lives
남준 오빠!! Today my team presented your biography, I showed them a video when you made a speech at the UN. My teacher commented, he said "it would be great if you added a video he was in a concert”
Since its hobi bday, he got the best seat. Remember when they fly to NYC for UN, its JK seat since he won the scissor rock paper, but later he gave it to Namjoon since he needs to rest before the big speech.
For real tho... After seeing the UN speech I started to do some research into BTS and the I’m fine was one of the first performance i watched and I started stanning after that. The song was so different from all the “kpop” songs out there, I was shook
Welcome to the ARMY! Age, gender, ethnicity, it doesn’t matter. If you want a true picture of who @BTS_twt are, listen to Kim Namjoon’s speech at the UN. ’m 45 a mom and proud member.
If you want to know something about who they are or what they are about please google BTS UN speech. It sums up a lot of their music regarding acceptance and loving yourself.
Same people who delivered a speech in UN So chaotic love you boys @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/seokcafe/status/1097151969993592832 …
A big boy very fond of crabs ~ When he runs like a toddler ,it's too cute to believe he is the leader of the most popular and well-known k-pop boyband in the world,and gave a speech at the UN! #RM @BTS_twt #ARMY #monohttps://youtu.be/C6uJaWh6wCQ
This is the same group that went to grammys? Speech at the UN???? BTS?
I will explain it in simple words: next generation leaders, Top Social Artist for two consecutive years, Grammys nomination, the biggest boy band in the world, speech to the UN and more.
Someone asked,why do you like RM of BTS?Basically,in her opinion, namjoon is smart,really cool,his english really great.She likes him after she heard namjoon's speech at UN.And she think namjoon quite tall.Sorry for my lack in english pic.twitter.com/BBZCRtNHPs
1. My favorite part of BTS visiting UN 2. presenting an award in Grammy 2019 3. Most memorable speech at MAMA 2018, Thank you for staying together no matter how hard it is, thank you so much for being u I should’ve known u earlier Bangtan pic.twitter.com/868UYf5Ai1
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE,WHERE YOU'RE FROM,YOUR COLOUR,YOUR GENDER IDENTIFY,SPEAK YOURSELF -PRESIDENT KIM NAMJOON AT UN. please she's so cute I'm indian..indians are really pretty and talented,stop RACISM..please check out UN SPEECH OF RM AND ALSO BTS, supporting Z-girls all the way
sometimes i forget the fact that my bf made a twitter fan acc for bts after he saw namjoon’s un speech
Every single @BTS_twt achieved something from beginning till now.. this is my fav moments of BTS carrier i never forget! - Billboard 2017 & 2018 - AMAs 2017 - Grammy 2019 - Medal Cultural Merit - UN Speech "team work makes the dream work - BTS" pic.twitter.com/Rw1vco12UI
BBMA 2017 BBMA 2018 kedua kalinya UN SPEECH so proudddd and then the Grammy im so thanksful to be a part of this fandom @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/UZWikuY5AD
1. MAMA 2018 @BTS_twt 2. GRAMMY AWARDS @BTS_twt 3. UN SPEECH @BTS_twt 4. PAS SELFIE SAMA PRESIDEN @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/atZLDKr3X6
BTS speech di UN General Assembly pic.twitter.com/njoeeHqr6W
Lastly I didn't even mention any grp I just gave a logic but I still remember how many kpop fans mocked BTS love urself series Making long threads of BTS selling depression, exploiting fans then shitting on their UN speech , MAMA speech . Whtvr ..
that un speech broke my heart when people starting mocking it and when they all started making tweets about why they didn’t disband was because of so and so. It’s just bts can never catch a break something they’d hate bts for is the same thing they’d praise another group for
I thought you muted BTS and ARMYs why are you here? The fact is that people were allowed to make tweets with 10k likes clowning joons UN speech, saying BTS sells their depression but now that your faves do the same it suddenly is great. ARMYs are allowed to clown other stans
* for us when many of u all mocked bts message, their UN speech nd emotional MAMA speech. Love yourself love myself peach .
for having an accent & dismissed the musical group as just “a boy band from Korea. BTS was giving an inspirational speech at the UN which was directed at the younger generation. It’s clear that @kendisgibson has something against Koreans,
Okay btch. First of y'all, literally all y'all never save a chance to sht on bts for the LY Series and how they're just "making money off their depression and milking it". Ive seen countless tweets laughing at their concepts, calling it nothing new, and laughing at RM's UN speech
anyways, bts says crawl back in your cage with their grammy attendance and nomination, multi daesang wins , un speech and attendance and so much more. if nobody gave a sh!t they woulve be popular. ignorance is not a personality trait sweety.
BTS alz make songs with social message with genuine feelings Many Kpop Stans from different fandoms:BTS selling depression, mocking their UN speech Kpop companies making same message as concept fr profit: few armys point out tht suddenly all armys r toxic.
Yeah some armys were saying stupid sht which i definitely didn’t like but the fact that kpop stans blew up tweets calling BTS “fake woke” for their UN speech and accused them of selling their depression annoyed the crap out of me
At least the army that tweeted it wasn’t talking about specific groups but about the industry as a whole meanwhile they legit quoted Joon’s UN speech ridiculing it and got thousands of likes saying BTS only opened up about disbandment because they wanted us to buy more but wtv
i guess ignorant is bliss huh?? Apparently all this BS that kpoop stans said about BTS using their mental health for emotional manipulation or how they made fun of RM English skills and speech at the UN, just because you.. one person didn't see it doesn't mean it isn't happening.
I thought it would be either "Speak Yourself," from the UN speech, or something about dreams from an RM performance monologue.
Try making her watch the un speech Not a song tho but I used that to convince my mother (and she’s really difficult to convince) Now she had grown to like bts and understand why i love them
BTS UN Speech
Cos namjoon’s UN speech deserves to be read in full @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/AzdFsXRzA8
I have an account for feminism that I made since January 2017 (2 years ago) and I posted this speech of @BTS_twt at the UN on there and it got so much love from you guys. I am so soft. Uwu pic.twitter.com/bU6Xe0ogV9
I think about Namjoon's speech at the UN and the amount of people who could have known about this event. His message about his own story could've reached so much more people if this kind of news had translations. #SpanishSubsInBTSPromo @hitmanb @bts_bighit @BigHitEnt @BTS_twt
Today I talked to my teacher about BTS and now she's going to watch namjoons un speech and give us homework about BTS ugh my mind
you realize that they probably have no idea who e*o is,,, right? they literally only know bts which is why they put their name and a link to namjoon’s UN speech in the first place ksksks
Click on the BTS link in the article and it sends you to another article of RMs UN speech
Today I watched Namjoon's UN speech again. Ohhh Namjoonie I thank god always that he created you. Your existence matters me lot. Thanks your words helped me to trust myself once again. Love you forever Namjoon. @BTS_twt
@thomas_page thank you for mentioning @BTS_twt’s visit to Dubai in 2016 and helping give more exposure to their beautiful UN speech via your article but may I ask how you knew? Did you watch the 2016 Summer Package in Dubai?
I'm really inspired by namjoon. Not only his music, but the way he looks at the world too(from what he tells us). I've made his UN speech and some of his fc posts as posters for inspiration when I'm feeling sad. I'm grateful that I discovered bts and part of that is kim namjoon https://twitter.com/lyricaleviathan/status/1096413732706574336 …
Probably because this group given a speech in UN advocate for UNICEF, were mentions Next Generations Liders also spread the importance in mental health among the young people and inspirate thousand of people to do good to others through their music. pic.twitter.com/Ari0nkCbdt
And I didn't expect him to sincerely like Suga's voice.. but he is so amazed that he said his voice is so manly and pleasing to the ears. I think I did well for making him watch RM's UN Speech, Run BTS Zombie Episode, and for making him listen to Scenery, Promise, WIOM & Ddaeng.
oh sorry about that, we as a fandom still are trying to improve ourselves because we tend to be overprotective when it comes to our boys since they receive hate without doing anything. if you have a time to spare, please do watch this speech at the UN shttps://t.co/iyfYZBY70y
For real, the UN speech is miracle for us. In my opinion it clear the boy band prejudice on them (bc not all people bhother to dive deeper to their music and lyrics)
I just listened to your ted talk and it was one of the best one of the best I’ve ever heard. I don’t think anyone linked their un speech in here but I think you would appreciate it https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
sometimes teens are scared to be juged by older so if they see other teens in the same "situation" as them they might be more open and we might help them. We also (my friends and i) want to show them @BTS_twt lyrics,UN speech, love yourself campain etc..Hope the director agree
Oh for goodness sake, the UN trusted him enough to give a privilege speech. So, the argument of his fluency in speaking English is irrelevant. TIME wasn't joking when they included @BTS_twt as next generation leaders.
It seems like I developed a hobby that whenever I found a pen and a paper, I will straight away write down Namjoon’s UN speech. It’s been everywhere on my workplaces. On my table, my laptop. I just can’t move on @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/0Vo2mdoTRd
Also, ICYMI, here is #BTS at the UN giving a speech about helping the youth of the world learn to "speak your name and love yourself". https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
i have really bad anxiety whenever i present in the front of the class but namjoon's UN speech about speaking yourself is my source of motivation. thank you namjoon @BTS_twt
Can we never stop talking about Kim Namjoon, world leader, president of planet earth and modern day philosopher giving his UN speech? ty for coming to my ted talk @BTS_twt
The UN speech and bts on the cove rof time magazine called next generation leader will forever be the most heartwarming
is that so? you mean to say @bts_twt were on the cover of Time magazine as next generation leaders, gave a speech at the UN, were awarded the cultural merit award, attended the Grammys and are South Korea's pride. thx for the remind
she's being an army since UN speech I know her
we showed some @BTS_twt speech at the UN and they cried
FYI my fandom doing charity TOO they not only wasted money for buying the stars, i find some accounts in social media that held charity by donating and etc, and when bts gave speech in the UN, I saw account that promotion to donate and they gave it to UNICEF,
For a project in my class I'm gonna be looking at a un speech and it might be @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/JKgFuaaY2W
now I’m not sure who you are but seeing as this is my stan acc you have come across I am obligated to share this and ask that you take a listen! it’s a speech Kim Namjoon the leader of Korean boygroup BTS gave at the UN, I believe it would interest you :)) https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1076405734097600512?s=21 …
BTS talk about their campaign and speech at UN while BP talk about their lightstick, no need to use big word to talk about lightstick
User @BTS_twt only need one member who is fluent in English to deliver speech for UN's Love Yourself campaign, to chart on BB since 2016, and also Jimin is Jimmy Fallon's favorite bts member. So what's not clicking?
I think about Namjoon’s UN speech a lot, specifically among the lines of, “What excites you and makes your heart beat?” simply because it’s what I would like to discover. For young students like me who aren’t sure of what your future holds, “just speak yourself.” #BTSLoveMyselfpic.twitter.com/cKg9u2txIJ
i just watched the video of bts at the un and i love watching jungkook care for namjoon and everyone praising namjoon, i watch his speech whenever i’m not feeling too good so now i can watch the them leading up to the speech and just
1st time I cried for BTS is when they won grand prize at MAMA 2016 2nd time was during RM UN Speech 3rd time when they are GRAMMY If next year, they won grammy, I swear I’m not gonna control and outburst my whole lung and cry out loud
even the UN speech i bet, mine is spanish and i understand his UN speech, the problem it’s just that she is maybe pressed bc bp isn’t in the big news like bts
Do you guys ever just watch BTS UN speech whenever your day not going well and then when you do you just cry? #BTSLoveMyself
@perdus_paradis heard someone say, im in to bts cuz they speak English. if Joons UN speech is mentioned, its abt him being/delivering a speech in an important place. his BBMAs speech was VERY easy to understand? your lack of comprehension to complex vocab is not his problem.
They started from nothing but a small dream, spending hours practicing. They were so dedicated. I highly recommend burn the stage the YouTube series and listening to the UN speech. These boys CHANGE lives. The amount of care they put out there is something we all need. @BTS_twt
Now... next time you bring them up, and someone scoffs and says , oh yeah "that kpop" band. you can counter with "first Korean artist to give a speech at the UN band" :)
She heard mic drop once and liked it! I'm hoping to start with UN speech I feel like that's where it finally clicks.
He said that Namjoon speaks English so well & he watched the speech from the UN & I’m just happy he’s genuinely interested in what I’m interested in. He sees my passion for @BTS_twt & pushes me to make the most out of it. My best friend forevaaaaa pic.twitter.com/u2N3sVhUmR
Look what my mom texted me today. I told her Spring Day. What other songs should I introduce her to? She likes Enya, Fall Out Boy, 80s power ballads, Madonna. I'm trying to be strategic. I'm also trying really hard to get her to see the UN speech too. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/jq2AzHULOx
I see army addressing the mockery joon has been getting bc of his English. It took someone to use another group and bts for them to notice. In reality army themselves have been saying worse things about joon’s English all these time, specially after the UN speech.
In Namjoon squeaking voice 'from now on...' A girl trying to belittle joon's speech like whut, do you even speak at the UN bitch. English is not his mother tongue language but he excellently carries the whole BTS to most award show with successful interviews. No complaint bitch.
Bts UN speech say hi. They can recite the whole dictionary but to usa gp, they arent special, as normal as who they meet on daily basis having a "good conversational english" as you said
Not every English speaker can give such kind of positive and thoughtful speech at UN. I’m very happy to see them being themselves. Accepting who you are and appreciating your origin is part of Self-Love. Be Authentic BTS! I’m so proud of you. #bts @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NFEpS8Skf6
THE TRUTH COMES OUT WHEN YOUR DRUNK! My brother is ALWAYS making fun of BTS and making fun of me for liking them. He’s drunk and messaged me, “I watched the UN speech that BTS gave. I love the message they are putting out there. I really like them.” FINALLY!! OMG
in English but they still not spreading the message that today world needs. They haven’t given a speech at UN. We love music bc it somehow relatable to our life. Yes it’s better if BTS can speak English fluently but it’s more than ok if they can’t bc they are Korean.
Moreover, BTS has always emphatically strived to be as inclusive and open-minded through usage of gender-neural pronouns in their lyrics and even openly encouraging people, regardless of nationality, gender-identity, or race to speak (for) themselves (UN Speech). +
anyways my self taught English speaking leader delivered a beautiful speech at the UN in English, what have your faves done other than constantly ride off BTS’ coattails?
Bts are realy fluent in chinese and japanese too. bts on ellen was like 2 years ago. They’re getting better in english. Diorang bagi speech kat UN of course lah kena bangga. Bagi speech depan world’s most important people kot. Meleis ni acah. Arab pun ntah lepas ke tak. Idiots https://twitter.com/z_ren95/status/1095334466224975872 …
So our teacher gave us an assignment to download speech that informs, persuades and entertain. And i think imma put the speech they made at the UN @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/contaeversial/status/1095525869357981696 …
Jk ive been hiding until recently i came out as a fanboy after joonie's speech at the UN lol. People judge me for liking a boy grp bt joonie said fck them opinions. :)
I’ll always rewatch BTS’s UN speech
this man did speech at UN, BBMAS, Grammys and everywhere but yet he still confused w his toys :( baby :( @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/relijoon/status/1095027688421638144 …
Also, the messages that they spread through their music and videos. The messages of self love, acceptance, friendship, mental health, societal issues. They ARE a big deal and should be noticed more. Bts were the first korean (if any) group to give a speech at the UN -
and hey I just wan't to slap you a fact that they made a speech in the UN. A korean boyband in the UN oh how a bout that? u can't relate. #BTS
I’m a UN ARMY I became one in Sept after this, I thought I’ll just be a casual listener but they won me over with the UN speech I know I have to support them with all my heart!
my man, kim namjoon, the one with an iq of 140+, the man who made a speech in the un, the youngest to receive the order of cultural merit, korea's pride, almost wrote with a marker on a blackboard. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/jWs3wYTaDM
I just saw a UN Speech Army! What a legit way to enter the fandom. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KQ8IGjrNOD
Listen to BTS SPEECH at UNICEF Youth 2030 The UN Youth Strategy #SoundCloudhttps://soundcloud.com/hanifa-rahmi/bts-speech-at-unicef-youth …
BTS has solidified their mark by the UN speech alone.
When I showed my mom BTS's UN speech the first thing she commented on was how earnest RM sounded. She was so surprised.
His real name is "Kim Namjoon" but his stage name is "RM" Do check out his music and BTS' speech at the UN and you'll find "guy with the glasses" even more attractive :)
yes, this is the man who gave a speech at the UN, presented an award at the Grammys, leader of the biggest band in the world, the future president, has an IQ of 148, and steals millions of hearts worldwide and what about it cr. gemini_0613_ @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/AXk8uiv1Y4
He said he was nervous? The man who gave the speech in UN and attended the GRAMMYS and the leader of the biggest boy band got nervous???? @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/riS7USxWNq
time magazine, cultural merit award, UN speech, grammy invitation and kpoppies still have the guts to compare bts to their faves https://twitter.com/illejeonkook/status/1094960952502448131 …
I couldn't believe that he was someone who speech at the UN and GRAMMYs LOL #RM #Namjoon #RunBTS #RUNBTSep63 #BTS pic.twitter.com/C4sec8q862
A person w/ influence started to get interested w/ BTS&I'm so happy that she's now talking about the UN speech. Until she mentioned RM as Kim Nam Jun cos that's how Unicef spelled it in the vid& now some army corrected her spelling aggressively. GUYS PLS DON'T SCARE THE LOCALS
joonie gave a speech at the un but he was still nervous about speaking in front of the rest of bts
oh and.. bts giving a speech at the UN headquarters
•AMAs & BBMAs (Top Social Artist) •Time Magazine's 'Next Generation Leaders' •BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy” •Order of Cultural Merit by South Korean Government •BTS Presents Best R&B Album to H.E.R. at 2019 GRAMMY Awards •etc @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KAuiTWKWQr
lmao BTS looks so weird. really dont get the fuss about them. their UN speech was great, but looks.......nope.
Well someone make fun of Taehyung because he can't speak English very well and questioning how they give a speech at UN. I ask him to learn first before talk and he replied me, "trying to know who is this rubb*sh BTS is gross."
Today I am who i am with all my faults and my mistakes . - @BTS_twt UN speech
Me gustó un video en @YouTube: H.E.R. Wins Best R&B Album presented by BTS | 2019 GRAMMYs Acceptance Speech https://youtu.be/0vkczu-AzBM
Yeah thats also true.. big german news outlets have written abt bts topping the bb200 chart and abt their speech at the UN. There were very nice comments by german gp talking abt looking beyond the box cause ger/eng arent the only languages
i told my crush (he is medical doctor) that i like BTS a lot and they keep inspiring me so he goes like yeaah i know them their song DNA, they delivered speech at UN right, hmm i know their leader *pointed to joon pic* he can speak english well
things that are real : 1) taehyung’s g5 in stigma 2) the bts un speech 3) bisexuals
I bet some amount of money to be yet determined that BTS' UN or Grammy speech is gonna be on their next album
I showed my aunt bts’ un speech. She said she was very impressed on how well Namjoon spoke English and she really liked what they talked about and represented
Part 2 where I mentioned BTS in my essays in English class We had to make an essay about someone who inspires us so I used BTS. I wrote about their UN speech and how they never give up I love adding BTS to my essays. The grader people will get to know how amazing they are.
Yeah we should be aware of the gvmt in every country tbh 1 of the reasons I’m a fan is bc of their passion for music. They had the same struggle as us & want to help us. Here is the speech of the leader of BTS at the UN for UNICEF, their message pic.twitter.com/iHYVD4yRTd
BTS paved the way. I dont recall any group from the 2nd gen performing at the BBMAs , AMAs ,giving speech at the UN ,boosting the korean economy by doing nth, being awarded & given letters by the president himself for spreading the Kor culture ww They did what no one did Stay mad
i got namjoon’s UN speech tattooed on me back in december and it’s finally fully healed so i can post it here @BTS_twt these words really hit home for me and i can’t thank bts enough for their messages of encouragement and love pic.twitter.com/1trHWJkOBD
Reminder that this person is the President #Namjoon who have speech at the UN Headquarters มาเจอเป่านกหวีดแบบนี้ ขรรมเลย @BTS_twt #TearItUpBTS #RM #BTS #BTSxGrammys #นัมจุนนี่ขี้แบ๊วกะนางฟ้าคนแมน #บังทันเป็นวงตลก #GRAMMYs #บังทันกับสติที่หายไปpic.twitter.com/0ZsD0YW3oL
Then if seventeen is like that why dont they have a deasang yet? Why arent they famous like BTS? Why didnt they go global when they had a reputed company behind them while BTS was in a small company? Why didnt they give a speech at the UN?
@BTS_twt UN speech https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
My therapist also knew about bts without me telling her. She mention their UN speech and their message

Dear Namjoon Your excellent leadership shined brightly again last night 20 weeks ago today you gave a heartfelt & lifechanging speech at the UN In the Grammy presentation you stated our next goal #SpeakYourself too ARMY It’s first step to making dreams come truepic.twitter.com/iKTNseixH1
Now a days people are getting so toxic. Please don't forget about @BTS_twt speech on #ENDviolence at the UN Assembly. Don't just jump to conclusions. Hate is spreading like fire because of all the misunderstandings. Can you not use this energy and do something good? #TearItUpBTShttps://twitter.com/UNICEFUSA/status/1092860162208133120 …
No UN speech, no opinion #TearItUpBTS
@BTS_twt make me watch things i never care before.. from BBMA to AMA to UN speech til the Grammy.. what an insight and experience you get when you are an ARMY! Thank you @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NagILX2Wyd
No UN Speech, NO OPINION. PERIODT lol @BTS_twt #TearItUpBTS
No UN speech, no opinion @BTS_twt #TearItUpBTS
No UN speech, no opinion #TearItUpBTS
I really hope others don't forget BTS' UN speech & their stance on #ENDviolence. Every day seems to be getting worse with many becoming increasingly toxic towards others by jumping to conclusions and spreading misinformation & hate like wildfire. #SaferInternetDay #BTSLoveMyselfhttps://twitter.com/UNICEFUSA/status/1092860162208133120 …
Lots of people calling BTS trash cz they thought BTS r TOO PRETTY to be called real men. Fyi, BTS presented a speech in front of UN general assembly, owns billion worth apartment in their 20s, and did lots of charity more than us. What did U do on ur 20s haters??? https://twitter.com/tinyseokjinnie/status/1094848032720355329 …
I'm kind of sad rn. My own brother who introduced BTS to me, talked (proudly) about their UN's speech to my mom and he even said that he likes namjoon. And now, he's the one who talk bad about them. I wanna cry. Is he embarrassed with me now, because i'm an ARMY?
Did you see BTS at the #GRAMMYs yesterday? Watch UN speech by RM of @BTS_twt #TearItUpBTS #MondayMotivationpic.twitter.com/dep8wcFazt
Slowly I’m turning my mom into a soft ARMY.... when I’m back home I monopolize the music in the car AND in my house and it’s 80% BTS, and also show her MVs on TV. Sent her the UN speech too and now I’m bombarding her with Grammy pics. Yes mama, fall in love with the boys
He has a solo album (an independent poject from his BTS group) called Mono. Its a free album you can listen to Spotify or Soundcloud! It received lots of positive reviews. He was also the one who gave the speech at the Un last Sept 2018. https://open.spotify.com/album/0XqAZHNx0xJDObehTI2587?si=Y9XH3FJrT9K5fY1VNV9HSw …
When I saw BTS delivering their speech at UN, that was when I saw them as role models for the new generation #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt
How BTS was suppose to be giving a 3 minute speech at the UN but RM said fuck it and gave them a 6 minute long one jsjs They really own the world https://twitter.com/hobiesmalls/status/1094841299084107776 …
that’s wonderful! i’m glad you liked it! yeah people tend to assume that because they’re a “kpop boygroup” their songs would be generic n shit but that’s not the case at all they really are, i’ve learned so much from them :’) have you heard their UN speech btw?
Sad ... when they were having their speech at UN, I missed it because a lecture... BUT IT'S OKAY COZ WE'LL HAVE MORE MOMENTS TOGETHER

Thank u for appreciating them they also deliver positive message through their music. Many people have inspired by them. They have campaign with Unicef and also had speech in UN, for the launching of Unicef & UN program for Youth Empowerment. #GRAMMYshttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=19 …
He love English/Korean/Japanese rhymes and wordplay. He also loves tiny sea creatures. Yup. That's Mr. Fluent in 3 languages, writes beautiful songs and Mr. UN speech :) @BTS_twt ( #TearItUpBTS)
THEY LOOK LIKE THEYRE MAKING A SPEECH FOR THE UN AGAIN IM SCREAMING #TearItUpBTS #GRAMMYs @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/GaYWXuaj5Z
Whoa!! I thought I just heard a recap of Namjoon's UN speech at the Grammys #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt
Kim Namjoon, Rapper, Leader of BTS, the one who delivered the UN speech
bts speech at the un https://twitter.com/atzgore/status/1094793590323273728 …
Our selfless and genius leader and president. The guy who wrotes almost all songs of @BTS_twt and inspires everyone with his beautiful words specially with his UN speech
similar nervousness when they had a speech for UN . That was intense haha
It's so funny how my sister hates bts but she knows everytime bts going to big event like "He's the man that gave speech at UN right?" "Oh you watching grammy? Bc of bts huh?"
Lol. That's RM. He's the leader. His real name is Kim Namjoon. He's the one that delivered BTS's speech to the UN General Assembly last year. His dimples are adorable, aren't they?
Tis been a mood for past 24 hours guys I don't think I'll be able to take it when bts actually appear and speak Tf it's not like it's a UN speech why??am??i?? #GRAMMYs #TearitupBTSpic.twitter.com/QxM4MiIBxo
In addition he spoke at the UN you should definitely listen to his speech. BTS overall spread powerful messages such as self love, women empowerment, and other social issues--> https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/03/16/12-bts-songs-strong-social-messages … I would link some songs but i have limited characters so check out this article
@BTS_twt is That A-list celebrity, the first kpop group to present a speech at the UN for the end violence campaign, the group that had been an underdog but now they're here at the front row of The Grammys #TearItUpBTSpic.twitter.com/BUTdhyohAu
The one with glasses is Kim Nam Joon - RM - leader of @BTS_twt and also the main rapper. He is quite talented (and hot lol), participating in producing myriad of bts's song and very good at using words. Last december he had a speech at the UN about generation unlimited pic.twitter.com/aCRCs9Wjgl
Ok but I ain’t forget how after their UN Speech she said “shoutout to Bts who have million of girls at home crying”
call me petty but i still ain’t forget when she down played namjoons speech at the UN by saying a bunch of girl were back at home crying #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/hopebiueside/status/1094770044788269056 …
she said something after BTS’s un speech that kind of undermined everything they said other than that idk
SJSJDJD THATS WHAT I THOGUHT i know she likes bts ,,i think ur thinking of someone else cuz i do rmr stuff on the tl abt the un speech thing
This the second proudest moment for me after UN speech #TearItlUpBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/DcLnJIifiJ
She’s a youtuber. She also did an speech the same day at the UN
she said smth about the fangirls must be crying rn after bts un speech but like ,,,. wtv people have done worse
"speak english a little bit" yeah that's why RM had a speech in UN coz he just can speak a little bit I hope there's no collab with the snotty one like them. BTS deserve better.
How can you say that a person who gave a long speech at the UN can only speak a little bit English...shame on you
A little bit?!?! Did he not watch the That 10 min speech at the UN....
OMG the morning speech was inspired by @BTS_twt ‘s message of ‘Love Yourself’ and quoted Namjoon’s UN Speech.
They're more than just singers, writers, producers, rappers and dancers. Their lyrics inspire MILLIONS and their lyricism is one of which that we're SO proud of! Please listen to their speech at the UN about speaking out for yourself! pic.twitter.com/F0WPq5sK92

can you guys pls reply with some of Namjoon's best speeches I need it for my assignment. I'm gonna write about the UN speech and the Citifield speech, but I need more examples and tag #TearItUpBTS!!! @BTS_twt
after mentioning their album was nominated for a Grammy, they could have continued to talk about the album itself, their music, their Love Myself campaign and the millions they’ve raised and donated, their UN speech ETC they focus on the fandom and how to #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt
Hey I think it would be an awesome idea to combine the #TearltUpBTS and Grammy hashtag with reasons as to why we support and love @BTS_twt I.e talk about their message, lyrics, musicality, charity work, un speech etc,,, I think as a fan base that would show great support!
Okay but here’s a challenge to Grammy presenters: Do not water down BTS to ‘boy band’ or ‘kpop’. Not the men who gave a speech at the UN. Not the men who inspired millions of fans to change their lives. Not the self-producing, authentic artists BTS #BTSxGrammys #TearItUpBTS
If you want beautifully written or poetic lyrics about self love etc., @BTS_twt may have them in store (if you're open to it) their genre's diverse too and they inspired a lot of people (fans and non-fans) on their UN Speech. #ERedCarpetpic.twitter.com/F0WPq5sK92

Why don't Armys post a moment that made them relaye to BTS under the #TearItUpBTS for instance when Namjoon gave their UN speech it made me remember how in elementary scool I gave a speech to my class on how we could make a better class environment for ourselves

flashbacks from the UN speech just came in my mind ahhh they've come a long way, they made it to the Grammys, there're really fulfilling all their dreams and i'm so happy and proud to be part of this journey, of this road together, forever #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt
I want to say namjoon's UN speech but really it's "I'm worldwide handsome, you know?" #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt

WHEN THEY GAVE THAT UN SPEECH!!! I knew who they were and had listened to their songs since pre-debut because my older sister was a fan.

i'm getting flashbacks of how nervous i was for bts' speech at the UN i'm gonna puke ive never been this nervous for myself #TearItUpBTS
When promoting @BTS_twt to the locals soon, please Link them to their UN speech, attach photo lyrics, attach links to their MVs or Songs. Again, if anyone already did a great job at this, leave it. We don't want them be overwhelmed. #TearItUpBTS

After the UN speech. So inspiring #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt
tell me, who managed to win 20+ daesangs, perform at bbmas, amas and AGT, win top social artist TWICE, give a speech at UN and is known as “the biggest boy group in the world”? #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt
When #BTS gave a speech at the UN assembly 2018, I thought I couldn't be prouder, but mehhhnn, it's #BTSxGrammys 2019! They thought we couldn't do it! Can't stop loving @bts_bighit proudly #ARMY, sooo #ARMYbehindBTS... #TearItUpBTS!!!
Remember when USA Today made this mini-documentary about the IMPACT of @BTS_twt after their UN Speech last year? This was just one of those moments you'd be even more prouder of truly how far #BTS have come, now they'd be at the #Grammys presenting an award omg.. #TearItUpBTSpic.twitter.com/KWGI1U3hvt

I don´t know of another boygroup to be asked for holding a speech at the UN. I´m so proud #TearItUpBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/IqlhMoZ5wD
I do agree wid u. Blackpink won quite a few daesangs last year, even got invited to present at the Grammys. Oh and let's not forget how Blackpink got the opportunity to make a speech at the UN assembly. Really, their success is much beyond that of Bts.
Are bts gonna include a ‘un speech skit’ in the next album?
I think I’m going local on my FB tonight for #BTSxGrammys. So many of my coworkers and friends comment IRL about what I post there. I shared @BTS_twt’s UN speech and got a lot of attention at work.
I hate BTS sm. Like what is there to like in a group which is being taught about in U of Berkeley and Khan Academy?A group which was at the UN to give a speech to the youth?A group which is going to the Grammys?A group of 7 talented and model boys who are an inspiration ?Ugh...
Thank you for sharing this version of BTS’s UN speech with their brainstorming ideas. My respect for Yoongi’s and NamJoon’s thoughtful and wise words grows every day. I am so inspired by these beautiful men’s mission to make a difference... in the WORLD!
Congrats & thank you I really hope you’ve gotten to listen to @BTS_twt music, hear their words, watch the UN speech so you understand that you’re guarding ppl who are literally changing & healing the world, that’s why we’re all so passionately behind themWe all feel the love!
AHSKKHG Y'ALL WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED!!! So I put up a status relating to the UN speech of BTS and one classmates of mine asked that she would watch it if it's in eng, so I send her the link and this is how she replied! I SWEAR THE LOCALS ARE IMPROVING! @BTS_twt #BTSxGrammyspic.twitter.com/gO2wk7mXbu
I was saying "bts are not just a kpop froup anymore they had a un speech" then i said does your kpop boy do this with a splash of water at it between every word then i realized I was going crazy
oh god I can never forget how I felt during the time when @BTS_twt gave the UN speech.. or when they performed at CitiField.. it was legendary. And this grammys... I am still so nervous! Same!
I’m so proud of BTS. they went to the BBMAs, AMAs, gave a speech at the UN, collaborate with UNICEF for a noble cause, humble and friendly when they won an award, literally a blessing towards everyone. THANK YOU BTS pic.twitter.com/vkWXnD3j1U
and industry, you needed more. Which is what BTS brought with the LY series, it's connection to UNICEF, the speech at the UN, sold out Citifield. They had something that would make people notice & cherry-picked the perfect shows to go on end of last year. What is the man +

remember when locals ask about bts, explain at them about their music and what they're doing ( about un speech and the whole love yourself series), drop sumn songs and ask what type of music they like. If you already see someone done this DON'T comment , please DON'T SPAM!
Don't be stressed baby, you got this Remember, you gave a speech at the #UN My LoveBelieve me when I say you can feel the energy exchange of encouragement from your supporters. We'll be cheering for you all @BTS_twt "Don't worry, we're already each others will" #BTS https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1094106512350298112 …
bts delivered a speech at the un, were the first kpop artists to win a billboard award (which they won two years in a row), have broken multiple youtube records, are global ambassadors for numerous leading brands, and are now going to the grammys, what have your faves done
Dear 2014 @BTS_twt though you are not aware soon enough in just a few years you will return to this city in very expensive suits presenting at Grammys. All that after selling same space 4 night in the row, after giving a speech in UN, and much more. And trust me you will love it. https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/488800013963624448 …
my mam’s friend text her to say she listened to bts’ un speech and loves everything they stand for and the messages they’re spreading n that she hopes i start believing in myself :( how cute is that
bts' appearance at the un ga is something that media and the un are still talking abt to this day. namjoon's speech has already made it to the list of bts' biggest achievements, imagine the impact bts at the grammys will make,,, it will go down in history. it already did
#BTSinAmerica ARMYS PLEASE REMEMBER: NO: memes, fancams, complaints or cringy statements (like "BTS own US") under official posts or locals asking for @BTS_twt YES: links to songs, mentions of their work, UN speech, Love Yourself campaign & message.

The fact that BTS, a whole korean group and the first ever boy band that made it to the grammy awards just feels so surreal tbh it's gonna go down in history. It's like the Billboard awards and the UN Speech all over again!!! I'm so fcuking proud to be an ARMY.
#BTS UN speech #zine, work in progress pic.twitter.com/8GooDNvAwr
I was on my way back home just now when suddenly my dad asked me about bts ..... MY DAD ACKNOWLEDGED BTS ?!! OMG !! I screaming inside eventho im not their fan but still i think it is one of the thing i should be proud of bcs old man recognised bts bcs of their speech in UN-
Indeed. I'm so sad that i only able to catch their UN speech a few days after because of work related deal. But still, it is don't make less of an ARMY.
belittling bts ? kings of lgbtq+ ? representatives of youth ? who gave an inspiring speech at un ? who are always and always educating themselves ? belittling them in this economy ? she ain’t shit and she always act as if she woke af but her racism is SMELLING
BTS 2013 : "come to our show,it's for free" Antis : look how poor BTS 2018 : sold out citi field,18 daesangs,BBMA's performance,Un speech,no1 bb,.. Antis:*petition against the blue house* BTS 2019 2e month: Grammys Antis 2019: mock them 4being rich what do yall want huh?
hoseok already released his mixtape....bts un speech...bts tear and answer...ly tour...idol ft nicki.....otw to grammys...yet still not hoseok x tinashe collab
The difference between this 2 group is BTS is much more HIGHER than your faves. UN asked BTS to give speech, BBMA asked them to come and even AMA too. And now Grammys asked them to present. YG mediaplays thats why america invite your faves. eYE hAVe to laUGh. Stay pressed https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …

It's not a hassle at all I made it to go with each tweet. Each day/tweet has it's own song, so it really builds on itself, when you read/listen to them one tweet at a time The 20th day is RM's UN speech, cause how could you not use that to motivate yourself #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/RWu20XE7E2
parts of the album sales were donated and additionally many armys donated. if those other activists youre talking about had accomplished the same thing they wouldve been invited to give the speech for UN's "Youth 2030" instead of bts pic.twitter.com/O4vqNP53Gp
@BTS_twt #RM please don't be nervous, YOU GOT THIS REMEMBER that you gave the perfect speech at the UN SO PROUD OF YOU MY BEAUTIFUL BABIESALL EYES WILL BE ON YOU SO ENJOY THIS AMAZING EXPERIENCE #jungkook #taehyung #jin #jimin #suga #jhope #bts #btsarmy #BTSxGrammyspic.twitter.com/i9BZgoOg8x
There was a shift in energy when BTS set foot inside the UN and gave that powerful speech.
"Waste It ON Me won gold certificates" on CNN Indonesia. they also mentioned BTS is the first KPOP group to enliven the Grammy Awards and the group that gave speech at the UN. I'M SO PROUD OF MY BOYS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NMdXotAjL3
Not only ARMYs but the entire world. #RM speech is now being part of english classes all over the world. #GenerationUnlimited #ARMYbehindBTS @BTS_twt
Well Ellen Degeneres asked BTS to come, Times magazine worldwide edition asked them to be in their cover, BBMAs asked them to come AMA's asked them to come too the UN asked them to give speech AGT asked them to performed and many more asshole. https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
Some people are misunderstanding. If it’s super hateful, this OBVIOUSLY won’t work, so block them. But if it’s a “What tf is a bts?” “Why are they even popular?” then reply nicely instead of getting defensive. Many adults were impressed by the UN Speech, for instance.
Thanks for your post @VisitUn @unicefkorea A very inspiring speech that I will never forget. "I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, little by little."Kim Namjoon @BTS_twt #ARMYbehindBTSpic.twitter.com/78sSjCfXpQ
I'm feeling the same as I felt when @BTS_twt were giving a speech at the UN...I'm very proud of them but also very nervous ehehe just me?!
i wonder, after giving the speech at the United Nations, if namjoon just doesn’t sweat the small stuff anymore. like, the UN speech was so extraordinarily important. and he excelled, his speech was fvcking inspiring. or maybe he still gets nervous, idk. but i wonder. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/R1Nn19JEzf
Let us never forget that Kim Namjoon (leader of k-pop group BTS) stood infront of the UN World Leaders with the other BTS members and gave us this beautiful speech. Never forget this iconic moment Let us neverf orget that BTS are more than handsome faces. #ARMYbehindBTShttps://twitter.com/Chells_twt/status/1093913266206765069 …
making my mom watch bts interviews and rm’s un speech
@BTS_twt of course! From being on the cover of Time, their UN speech, and Unicef ambassadors??? I would be honored
My mum is a spiritualist and when i showed her BTS' UN speech she said they were "the disciples of the new world" pic.twitter.com/WjVFh3nGhz
NAMJOON SAID HE WAS NERVOUS BEFORE GOING TO DO A SPEECH IN UN BUT HE DID IT VERY WELL. AND NOW HE SAID AGAIN ON THE VLIVE CHAT THAT HE IS NERVOUS BUT FOR ALL WE KNOW HE / THEY WILL DO WELL IN GRAMMYS. WE BELIEVE IN THEM. WE ARE BEHIND THEM #ARMYBehindBTS @BTS_twt
. @BTS_twt #RM Iu, u're 1 of the most caring charismatic sensitive eloquent person I've seen I know u'll be stressed out @the #GRAMMYs but u rocked your speech @the @UN so u'll rock the Grammys too It's sad that ARMY can't attend but we'll be there in your ♡ #ARMYbehindBTS
BTS' speech at the UN is still so powerfully relevant. Love yourself, speak your truth, and tell adversity Not Today! #BTS #ARMY #LY #qotd https://www.instagram.com/p/BtohgZsAOXs/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share&igshid=q0nd5lw4r8nq …
i think i might have a perf concept for my thesis already... love yourself, love myself. THANK GOD I CREATED an army ig highlight. nakita ko yung un speech ni rm ugh god ilove you, thanks alr @BTS_twt !!!
i think i did pretty good for my speech! i loved peoples suprised faces when i said that bts spoke at the un. but now im leaving class early because im in too muc pain to live thru the next two hours
he has 6 boys behind them, staff behind the stage. and 18M+ of armys all over the world. the pressure he must be feeling, like that of the UN speech he had. 4000% recharged to Namjoon and the rest of bts. #ARMYBehindBTS
@any interviewer thats gonna bombard bts with 'fans dying to know whos ur celebrity crush' we dont care about that shit, stop asking such useless questions, ask them about their campaigns with unicef or their un speech or their other stuff but not that
#ARMYbehindBTS Don't be nervous, you guys even gave a speech at the UN! Just do what you guys usually do and everything will be perfect! Please be save and have fun! We love you @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt remember how you all went to UN general assembly to give speech on youth unlimited to leaders of the world? well you gonna be fine at Grammy awards hun, i love you! pic.twitter.com/9EFNbmzmpR
My dad acts the exact same and my mom used to but she listened to the Un speech and now she's love bts but my dad I don't think will ever and that's okay. I hope your dad will understand their impact soon and how they help a lot of people. Lots of love bubs
I believe in shy guy Mony and our boys They really gave inspiring speech at UN infront of the world leaders and people around the world, even though ARMYs are not there They will do it well, I believe in them @BTS_twt fighting Be yourself, because you are perfect
31. Dawn 32. I haven't ride roller coasters lol 33. I don't think I ever thought about my lucky number/s 34. RM's speech at UN 35. Wow since I was 7 I already into kpop lol 36. BTS's early albums until latest album. Similar thing with Seventeen. 37. Eyes
idk if you remember but bts went to UN and gave a speech it's amazing how they went to the UN like they are bts and went to the UN it's a great achievement that the UN invited bts to give a speech to all those people in the UN, bts really went to UN and the UN invited them
@enews @etnow @accessonline ion wanna hear any ugly questions like bts’ celebrity crush or fav american food IM SICK OF IT ! and so does the boys so PLEASE ask relevant questions like the un speech or their first reaction if going to the grammy JUST ANYTHING BESIDES THE UGLY QS!!
And I keep watching BTS speech in UN GA 2018, those 6mins speech keeps reminding me many things, I even save the video so I still can watch it even when there’s no internet connection.
they were invited to the UN to give a speech and now more koran groups are getting collabs with artists from other countries too. in spain you would have NEVER heard kpop on the radio. ever since people started to request bts, now other groups are requested too
BTS's UN Speech
Massive sales, sold-out shows, major music award shows, numerous awards for their music, UN speech, Time cover, etc. @BTS_twt out here provin’ that the only thing they cannot do is mediocrity. May we all be inspired to always chase after excellence despite our circumstances
i am watching fox life and i saw the grammy ad and I said to papa that BTS would be there and he said "isn't it the group that gave a UN speech that you shared on FB." So I proudly said yes.
Their UN speech encourages a generation to speak up and have a voice for themselves. They donate $1M to their campaign with Unicef/UN alone. They do not sound off publicly and quietly do what’s right. Just because you are ignorant doesn’t mean BTS doesn’t do what they are doing.
By watching namjoon's speech at un and watching blood sweat and tears mv. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/zwyMjUGOfG
BTS individually are just seven strangers that met and they created a single vision filled with positivity and love. He was a spokesman for their beliefs, values, and goals. He could help convey their message to the rest of the world through the UN speech and shared his story.
bts: UN speech, BBMAs, AMAs, Ellen, Corden, Fallon, entries on the Hot100, two consecutive albums topping BB200, selling out citi field 55k capacity in under 15 mins, ++++ them: my faves were nominated for a Teen Choice awards first
tell 2013 bangtan that one day their bts episodes and bangtan bombs would consist of them winning awards left and right, them performing on american award shows, them giving a speech at the UN, and maybe soon? a video of their very first attendance at the annual grammys
Correction! BTS gave the speech in September 2018 Note: @BTS_twt is in partnership with @UNICEF to #ENDviolence for youth. Together they launched @_GenUnlimited to support youth around the world in education & employment at the @UN's 73rd General Assembly. #SpeakYourselfpic.twitter.com/4lv7FZ3PsB
I LOVE YOU PRESIDENT NAMS! This speech never fails to amaze me and make me smile and tear up everytime
So Namjoon & Jimin are my mom's favs bc of Joon's UN speech, & jimin bc she thinks he's v cute & talented, and she wanted to comfort him when he cried on BTStage. Her "wrecker" is Yoongi bc she says he raps really well and was hella funny in BTStage @BTS_twt #BTSARMYmoms
This is wonderful! The principal at my kids elementary knows @BTS_twt after watching their UN speech. He was very impressed about their message. Their impact goes beyond that of a “boy band”.
HOWEVER, when ARMYs bring up BTS’ achievements, others brought down. ARMYs won’t deny your fav’s achievements, but y’all will make fun of Namjoon’s UN speech and make it seem like The Grammys are less than Coachella.
BTS UN SPEECH T_T
i can talk bc BTS has done a UN speech, has a grammy nom, merit award, ambassador for many products, time mag cover, is 3% of SKs economy, etc. Also Columbia distributed for Fake Love. Your jealousy n ignorance isnt cute. https://twitter.com/longdongjiyong/status/1093683435112226817 …
Just rewatched their UN speech and I’m a mess .. the tears just coming and coming I love you and soo proud of you @BTS_twt
. @BTS_twt will also take the Grammy Stage with: —One of the top ten albums in the world last year & combined album sales at the top —A world song chart all-kill —An appearance & viral speech at the UN —Over $1M raised —Top concert ticket of 2018
stfu my dad knows why they gave a speech in the UN he said they represented youth right? hshssh then he is like "whose coming to grammy?BTS?" and he goes "oh that's cool they gonna perform too, we SUPPORT OKAY? WE LOVE BTS IN THIS HOUSEHOLD" pic.twitter.com/WSPewFh6Kl
nobody complained when they sat like this for their UN speech so i really don't get why a lot of people are pressed about this
when i thought the un speech were it for bts like thats the highest they could go and then the korean cultural merit happened & now the grammys,,,, honestly what is coming next i cant even fathom
you know what's funny? i've not been able to watch bts' un speech since it happened more than twice. this speech makes me have a breakdown lmao... the way i ugly cried when we watched it live, yall i didnt cry like that for YEARS
@BTS_twt notice my sugar momma she got some cute ass dogs who’ve memorized your whole UN speech in barks
After this huge event we might face racist/xenophobic comments once again. They will try to take that historic moment away from us but remember that they can't. Just like the UN speech or the comeback at BBMAs. BTS will keep making histroy and revolutionize the music industry.
so many locals appreciating bts and referring to namjoon’s UN speech
I think we should fill the main tag with informative information on BTS, who is BTS, lyric posters, song recs, UN speech, reasons why we love BTS etc. also, for the boys' fashion we should trend "BTSonRedCarpet"
Actually really tired of this. All I get is my dad saying ‘it’s been 5 years now, I think you should stop liking them’. When I attempted to show him the UN speech and why I adore BTS so much, he shut me down.
When BTS charted on Hot100 who hated them? Kpop stans. When BTS got #1 on Billboard 200 who hated them? Kpop stans. When BTS got a KMA nomination and won who hated them? Kpop stans. When BTS gave a speech at the UN who hated them? Kpop stans.
RM's UN Remarkable SPEECH I wrote it. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Ag6ZmQ1xLy
i hope u all know that my international relations major jumped out when my bts bias when from jimin to namjoon all bc of the un speech
i was asked by my counselor yesterday who’s the most influential person in my life,, without hesitation i said BTS and i said “insert UN speech”
OMG are they those 7 fine men who did a speech at the UN? That speech was so touching I fell in love with their leader
this is the guy speech in UN also this is joonie Ohh joonie u so cute @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/tmttshoseok/status/1093126488168251392 …
Kinda made me pushed myself a little back then, I started to find another major that will make it easier for me to land a job. But then after BTS’s speech at the UN, I realized how badly i want to speak myself
tbh one of the reasons my mom started liking bts was when i showed her the UN speech and explained to her that they arent just a boy group-they are out there and are spreading a message that so many needs to hear. https://twitter.com/jjkthelittleone/status/1093096449057964034 …
SAME! I was watching the UN speech and my friend who isn’t even mildly interested in kpop or BTS dropped what she was doing to come listen and expressed how impressed she was with them. I can’t wait for more GP to take notice. We should trend their UN speech as well!
Namjoon ah ~~~~~~~ I'm one of milions of ur fans - ARMY You gave an inspirational speech at UN, hit no.1 Billboard Hot 200, won many Daesangs and awards in Korea and international awards such as Billboard,AMAs,...w/ BTS And you guys are gonna be attending Grammy! Legends! pic.twitter.com/mxnSJaQANC
@BTS_twt: - goodwill ambassador of @unicefkorea who attended n gave speech at @un general assembly - being @time cover magazine as the tittle 'next generation leader' Now, they will be attending @RecordingAcad #BTSxGrammys as presenter also the album got nomination. ~
I first knew about BTS because of Taehyung: Hwarang I got into BTS because of Namjoon: UN Speech and Mono Deep into the fandom, my bias are: JIMIN & RM
My dad gets annoyed that I never shut up about BTS but I played the un speech for him again today and he said he got shivers *again* just like when I showed it to him when it came out. The impactttt
Nah. Comeback at me, when your faves are not going lose again with rookies. Comeback at me, when your faves are not in a brink of losing daesangs count with BTS. Comeback at me, when your faves perform and chart well on billboard. Comeback at me, when your faves do speech at UN.
one thing that some people still don’t get is bts’s actual capability and potential that go way beyond the musical circle. music wise, legends;but there’s a number of people who grew interest in them bc of namjoon’s UN speech and this isn’t something you see everyday. it IS huge
until yall can name another group that broke into the bb chart multiple times, gave a un speech, was nominated and invited to the grammys and has sold out a stadium in the us in less than 20 minutes yall can shut up with that "bts didn't pave the way" bs theres no one like bts
Kim Namjoon - leader of BTS - 24 years old - rapper - DIMPLES - A Very Smart Cookie (IQ of 148) - fluent in english!! he gave a speech at the UN about embracing self love!! check it out!! - theres so much to say but HHHHHHHH IM BAD AT THIS I JUST LOVE HIM A LOT U FEEL pic.twitter.com/kslTsAEi69
yeah OF COURSE we beg the UN to invite bts to gave a speech,, of course. yeah we beg the grammys to invite bts as an award presenter,, we beg the national television to showcast bts on the news https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …

ah yes I, too, remember when we signed a petition for the UN to have BTS make a speech there ??? I'll never understand dragging a group to bring another group up.

Kim Namjoon (from @BTS_twt) UN speech is memorable, i’m still so proud of them pic.twitter.com/hhvpUpS7cZ
Wow! My French is surprisingly good Great article! Well researched! Talking about everything that makes @BTS_twt special. Also giving example of songs dealing with specific topics and links BST MV and UN speech :) The PR! All this because they’re presenting at Grammys! https://twitter.com/asmie_twt/status/1093280046339538945 …
@BTS_twt was there because there are reasons for them to be there.. like albums, chart records, fanbase, their influence, their UN speech, too many to mentions.. theres really a reasons for them to be where they had been..
Bold of you to assume BBMAS, AMAS, GRAMMYS, UN for the speech, and AGT didn’t ask BTS to come. You should be happy for your faves, cause they have zero relevancy in America. BTS had to crawl so that BLACKPINK not even run but stand bbygirl, I’d shut up if I was you. pic.twitter.com/q149mkjsjJ
Our guys handled the UN and Joonie even moved so many with an unforgettable speech. I believe in them and I'm sure they'll have a great time at the Grammys. Maybe we should trust more in their ability to shine?! Their seven strong adult men who will do just fine!
when bts entered the US the bbmas PERSONALLY asked them to come present an award then PERSONALLY asked them to come perform. the amas PERSONALLY asked them to perform. the UN/ UNICEF PERSONALLY asked them to come give a speech at the UN headquarters and the grammys PERSONALLY + https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
my electronics media professor talked about bts UN speech, even played the clip and the guy next to me said “wow.... I needed to hear that”
i predict next comback will have something to do with speaking yourself & knowing your name & no matter what your into or what your name is just just learning how to be yourself & speak your mind. like namjoon said in the UN speech @BTS_twt
Totally, because we petitioned to UN officials that BTS better give a speech or we'll shoot https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
Thank you for giving his speech a chance. Namjoon is the leader of BTS and he actually wrote the UN speech which is based on his experience and his real story. He also learnt English all by himself, and a top student nationwide with an IQ of 148.
lol this made me think of all the times my colleagues who think it's cute to tease me about anything BTS-related are actually the ones who bring up BTS news/trivia first whenever we speak (UN speech, WIOM dropping, BTS coming to SG etc)
Uhm girl, we don’t beg and we don’t made petitions for BTS to be involved in BBMA, AMA, guess in Ellen, have a speech for UN Conference, to be cover of TIME MAGAZINE, and present an award in Grammy’s. What kind of sh*t is this?
it happens every single time bts does something grand or gets recognized by bigtime people/groups/events lol. they say they dont care but...... really, huh (i mean, even their UN speech was clowned by kpop twt LMAO that was peak Bitter Envy) https://twitter.com/jiminrnb/status/1093146895768117248 …
So uhm who’s willing to sign a petition to put #RM UN speech on Spotify @BTS_twt
remember how everyone were LITREALLY nervous af over bts doing speech at the UN as if we were the ones up there doing the speech??yeahh that's gonna be me again when they're announcing that one award on the stage at the grammy infront of top artists.
The GRAMMYs PERSONALLY invited BTS to attend and present. UNICEF PERSONALLY invited BTS to attend the UN assembly and give a speech....what exactly is your point? https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
I didn't know that for BTS to give a speech at the UN we had to sign a petition
I can't remember signing a petition for BTS to give a speech at UN or a petition for BTS to be on Time Magazine's cover or - hilarious - for BTS to go to Grammys. But go off I guess
I can't remember signing a petition for BTS to give a speech at UN or a petition for BTS to be on Time Magazine's cover or - hilarious - for BTS to go to Grammys. Just stfu https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
FYI we didnt beg for BTS to get recognized by BBMAs it all started there. the beg or petition youre saying? never happened. We just asked the radio stations to play BTS' songs & thats all. Did we beg or petition for them to get speech in the UN? Grammys? no they did it PERSONALLY https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
My nephew keeps asking me when Monsta X are giving their speech at UN...little creature, somehow he believes that all Kpop idols get the floor there, like @BTS_twt!
I know we're worried about red carpet interviews but people in the US know a lot more about BTS now. The UN speech and the LY Series are almost always mentioned when they are discussed here now. I have high hopes for most interviewers this time. I do.
@BTS started following BTS right after watching Kim Namjoon's speech at UNICEF. BTS is really something, keep going.
Urm, Hello excuse me Since when Army's beg them for BTS attend UN Speech and Times Magazine front page covers? Is they personally call them you know why? Because they are most influent, they are talented, their song is original, they find their way to promote their song not using
Same goes to BTS got invited by the GRAMMYS PERSONALLY and the UN SPEECH PERSONALLY.. Invited to the Micheal Jackson's 60th Anniversary PERSONALLY. BBMA personally Asked BTS to perform. Maybe if you just focus on BP mayB u can help em' get nominated in many awards https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
im having a very constructed conversation with a few friends abroad abt bts being one of their friends presented a speech quoting namjoon's un speech and now they're intrigued! im so happy
Anyways, BTS sleeps well,eats good food,composes & writes good music &chats happily with ARMY, unbothered, as the youngest recipients of the Cultural merit, having a UN speech, TIME cover, GRAMMY nom & invitation, several daesangs & int'l awards. That's all what matters.
Article about BTS UN speech https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/09/20/entertainment/bts-united-nations-intl/index.html … “BTS became an existence who is beyond the Kpop” http://naver.me/FB0qg1qP
BTS is first KOREAN act who gives speech in UN pic.twitter.com/ExjAok1kdQ
But how come local found Joon’s UN Speech(just now)??? It’s literally everywhere on my tl. No complain tho. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/H7zi1sB064
We? Army? Bighit? BTS? Beg? Petition? Uh? What?.......... Hun, BTS was personally nominated and perfomed for BBMA, AMA, etc, personally asked to make a speech in UN, personally asked to guess in Ellen, late late show, jimmy kimel, AGT, jimmy fallon, etc. https://twitter.com/GrayTheStallion/status/1092979240738394112 …
i saw some locals starting to appreciate bts too, even the namjoon's un speech blew up within them and they're actually having it. i'm so happy
I just told my dad BTS told a speech at the UN because i put namjoon's unicef speech as my whatsapp profile picture... my dad doesnt care abt idols at all so its another win for me!!!
BTS was invited to perform and attend huge award shows. Invited to give a speech to diplomats around the world for the UN. Huge global artists are in their DMs. Lmao shut up with your insecurity.
Lmao what are you talking about..even i never sign any petition for bts. They got UN speech, TIME Magazine, invitations m, etc without us begging
Fake ot7/ot6/solo stans don't care about "BTS" ..NJ is the one who can talk about bts album &what inspired them to write/produce & the behind the scenes of each song on v-live. He's the one who 6 members really adore. He's the one who did UN speech that touched people's heart.
The speech of BTS in unicef ..inspires me a lot.
So uhm i talked with my aunt bout BTS cause she saw me watching Joonie’s speech at UN and i explained to her about their advocacy and songs and impact and she was sh00k and surprised :<
every time comeback gets near, god gives bts a chance to speak on an important event ever since billboard top social 50. come of think of the skit, im not saying they'll win and have a speech on grammy, but there's a chance, though i feel like the un speech is sumn else.
News: BTS is the first Korean band to hit no. 1 on Billboard, win TSA 2 years in a row and attend grammys and give a UN speech and- Society: did they say plastic surgery? Mmhmm
Bts really out here teaching youths how to love themselves, being ambassadors for UNICEF, going to grammys and giving a speech at the UN but society just sees them as Korean boys who did plastic surgery and being popular because of some crazy fangirls make it make sense
My cousin who is a male doesnt really into kpop said to me that he admired RM @BTS_twt UN speech pic.twitter.com/FEsXSxOu8E
When @BTS_twt gave speech at the UN that was the most memorable for us ARMY and them as well
Hmm, the meaning of “I Purple You”/ is definitely the most important. Next would be the message they give about the “ocean and desert.” “Dream” would be another, meaning is given to that word through many of their songs like Paradise, So Far Away and in Namjoon’s UN speech.
Remember when every fandom was clowning the un speech, really fun times, anyways they’ll clown anything bts/army related it’s never going away
evER SINCE THAT UN SPEECH I SEE PARENTS AND ADULTS ALIKE SPIRALLING DOWN THE BTS HOLE I CANT BELIEV
I remember how I used BTS’ UN speech for my efcom class because I was so proud of them.. Now grammy? Always proud of this boys.. I know they will succeed more.. #BTSxGrammys
So currently i have to choose the tittle for my thesis but i’m not sure what kind of research that will take. I’m still in doubt to choose between an analysis towards bts’ UN speech or an analysis towards their love yourself series cover album. pic.twitter.com/yKX9d1EBxd
Incase you are worried about bts attending Grammys where armys won’t be there to cheer just know that they attended and made a speech at UN with all those world leaders and there were no army bombs and they did well. I’m sure at the Grammys they will be fine, this is bts
My boss respects the boys so much that he even sent me BTS UN Speech. I was sooo proud that day. My ego was sooo up!!! He is not a fan btw. pic.twitter.com/1pw6Gs1CEJ
my wife she got home from work today & after she gets settled in, i go, "sooo..." & she says "i know, i saw your twitter, BTS will be at the Grammy's " then i showed her their UN speech cause i was crying over it & we watched the new Run ep. together
Antis: you'll never make it Namjoon: we'll prove it you *BTS now* Invited to grammys to present award, won BBMAs top social artist, performed at AMAs, became the biggest boy group in the world, invited to UN for speech, etc. Namjoon: told you so
We talked about the diversification in nowadays diplomacy both in the agendas and actors... my professor had one JOB and it was putting bts’ UN speech as a prime example in this essay I will- pic.twitter.com/XLwVKUWtns
...if they can conquer making a LIFE CHANGING speech at the UN with no “visible” @BTS_twt ARMY, they’ll survive the Grammys. #IHope
I just wacthed Jennifer Lopez presenting Best New Artist at 59th Grammy with such a moving speech i believe @BTS_twt will follow suit or even do better.. (flashback to Namjoon's UN speech) https://twitter.com/BangtanSeaDayak/status/1092789706851442688 …
Those people who said "just #GRAMMYs" they are actually jealous and looking for ways to enter to @GRAMMYs Speech in UN, perfomance & receive awards in Bilboard & AMA, now .... #ARMY & #BTS we did it !!!!!! pic.twitter.com/RDDk6T74vJ
"I have many faults, and I have many more fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I'm starting to love myself, gradually, little by little." UN speech - #RM @BTS_twt #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/DMsd7YlGOy
...which is by being offensive and verbally abusive...? Well, I personally like to learn from music, not just listen. Please, watch bts un speech
anyways bts remain unbothered with their 2 bbmas, ama performance, un speech, time magazine cover, and grammy attendance and nomination
This person is not an ARMY but Joon’s UN speech caught their attention and his words connected with them! I had to quote this because this is what @BTS_twt is; they’re a safe heaven for those who need it most. I hope you find comfort in them as we all have love https://twitter.com/quixoticache/status/1092792514187149312 …
So the UN speech is irrelevant? Popularity is when not only the fans but also gp knows the artists. It's when they get compared with the top artists like Ariana, Imagine Dragon, Eminem
But they'we been in bussiness since long ago, isn't it normal they have more sales? And when talking about popularity - it's not only sales. Things like Grammy nom, UN speech - they don't happen to just anyone. So yes, BTS is popular worldwide and they deserve it pic.twitter.com/EbVzApow6H
Grammy, un speech, cultural merit award, bbmas, amas billboard top 10, billboard number 1, albums selling million, literally so many things I could go on forever
Did you delete the tweet? I sent a reply to you not knowing bts but it's nowhere to be found. Bts has political and social messages in their lyrics and write and produce their own songs. They also gave a speech at the UN about loving yourself and speaking yourself
If you’re nervous for a presentation or a speech, just think about how Namjoon talked to the whole world at the UN speech. He was so nervous, and yet he did it. If Namjoon can, then you can as well BTS believes in you. Just look at him, and you’ll feel like confident rush to u pic.twitter.com/FLllaK9EBq
the fact that the unicef is using a portion of namjoons un speech to promote safer internet day is only another way BTS has gone beyond the typical 'boy group' standards
UN speech, first comeback on bbma, grammy invitation, bts received korean pop culture & arts award, they meet President of sk & gave his sign to jin & jk. ugh forget it, i cant even pick one btween these https://twitter.com/kthmixtaepe/status/1092723153778831360 …
I love that Yoongi is s phychic, namjoon was right, it's BTS year again, Billboard, AMA, Grammy's, UN speech NYC, I still can't believe it. BTS deserves to get nominated now
There this kinda-not-really ted talk going on at our school and I really wanted to talk about namjoons UN speech but they said that we’re NOT allowed to talk about BTS pic.twitter.com/gilWoTImMQ
i still get goosebumps whenever i watch namjoon giving the un speech, especially this part. the message is short, yet powerful enough to spread it all over the world. what a powerful team. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/OZ4tYiNfqc
I don’t think they aren’t doing tht for clout, bc fyi, BTS gain lots of hatred in Malaysia bc of childish locals are triggered over small things and make fun of us and BTS. This started few months ago but many of us try to ignore them or reply with fancam spams or UN speech
The amount of locals saying "I'm not a bts fan but" and highlighting some of their great achievements such us their speech in the UN assembly or their performance at billboard charts... let's get this promo just and only for bts!
Namjoon UN speech left such a big impact on me. He truly inspires me, BTS inspires. Thats why i always share my love for BTS proudly even within a conservative surrounding because i believe in their music, message. @BTS_twt #BTS #방탄소년단pic.twitter.com/aahqXZmF1B
Yes, it is UNHEARD OF but they can't resist the pull of the boys @BTS_twt : UN speech bcoz of their contribution to UNICEF. Time magazine cover, Order of cultural merit. To know that they have a hand in producing, composing, writing lyrics. To know they release songs for FREE!
1. Who first caught my attention: Namjoon (from that UN Speech) 2. My 1st bias: V or Jungkook 3. Is my bias: HOSEOKKKK JHOPE 4. My bias wrecker: V 5. 1st BTS MV: Mic Drop 6. Fav BTS Choreo: Best of Me 7. Fav BTS Album: Love Yourself: Answer 8. Fav song: Answer: Love Myself https://twitter.com/lyugguk/status/1092084551453675520 …
The list of achievements and first-steps bts has taken here is too long to list in one tweet. We cannot forget the SOLD OUT world tour and the UN speech!!! This is a bts only event. Next!
When i became an ARMY and their UN speech @Amnaanjum8
@BTS_twt will dominate 3 awards in US, Given speech at UN, Sold Out Concert at Citifield, Received Order Merit. The first korean artist did that but how many artists in the world hv done all these 4 achievements. BTS is another level
And then her hubby suddenly asked, "What were they talking about at the UN?" I was like wtfhsjsgsgs he did hear about the boys then so I told about UNICEFxBTS and the Generation Unlimited and Joon's speech and they both awed #BTS @BTS_twt
As if RTing this dvmb sh*t can take away BTS’ billboard chart placement, invitation to GRAMMY, all their PAKs, their BBMAs trophies, their daesangs, undo RM’s UN speech, recall their 5M sold albums, and a million other achievements lmao. These local meleis are wildiiing I tell ya
then the next day she told me, "listening to BTS is good thing actually, most of the lyrics is talking about social, anxiety, and lots of positive messages, me as a doctor would like to litsen to them more after the UN speech,they are so cool and aware abt what people facing "
MARTY IM SCARED MY TEACHER STILL REMEMBER THAT DAY WHEN I SHOWED HER BTS AND BROUGHT IT UP IN CLASS....(I showed her the speech at the UN and she said great speech and what a great looking men(referring to all of them))
I think they will be aware of this. Remember UN speech behind from Bangtanbomb and Ama behind from Burn The Stage? They have conference whenever they attend new, unexperienced event
Ahhh also the UN Speech!! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/yminstradamus_/status/1092631248818692100 …
"I will prove it to you all" He did. They all did. From being nobody to giving a speech at the UN to being the youngest recipients to receive the Cultural Merit Medal to now attending and also presenting at the Grammys. #BTSxGrammys @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/dtOCK1Vfou
Okay since we have a LOT now, which is your favorite BTS achievement till now? Mine are- 1. the UN speech in front of so many world leaders, it was SO unexpected 2. Grammy invitation (I can't pick btw these two)
You know,,,,Kim Namjoon is a fricking intellect like I am rewatching the UN speech he made and I’m blown away. Not only is he speaking a language he taught himself, but the content of his korero is so inspiring and shows such thought and intelligence #NamjoonAppreciationTime #bts
I still need Skit: UN speech Make it happen @BTS_twt @bts_bighit
Noooo don’t put that idea in his head smh,he even included us in his UN speech
Oh? Anyways stream BTS inspiring UN speech! https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
bts has a lot of power, my parents are in love with namjoon’s un speech, one of my irl swore that she won’t be part of any fandom but 2 years after she has jimin as her icon on ig and another irl is a tae stan when she swore that she won’t like kpop THEIR IMPACT
i just rewatched namjoon's speech in un assembly AND i have it confirmed it once again: bts will only be the group i will love
RM even prepared the UN speech by himself. @BTS_twt are loved by their fans worldwidely because they keep on spreading awareness about mental health and positive vibes. BTS songs "Not Today" and "Fake Love" are about learn to love yourself. Humanity .
i’m watching namjoon’s un speech and i’m incredibly proud . it’s really hitting me that they’re out there LITERALLY working and achieving all of their goals-which makes this grammy news all of the more heartwarming. Ily bts and thank you for everything #BTSxGRAMMY @BTS_twt
this picture says it all 2013 BTS wondering if they could ever debut —> 2019 BTS going to grammy presenting an award and being a voice for those who can’t speak for themselves (UN speech) @BTS_twt #BTSxGrammyspic.twitter.com/G1PFWhVejB

@BTS_twt achievement so far this year *UN Speech *Billboard Top Social Artist 2nd consecutive year *1st Korean group to enter ‘Hot 100’ at #10 *1st Korean artist to perform at New York Citi Field *Awarded Order of Cultural Merit Attending & Presenting an award at #Grammyspic.twitter.com/CK7Lg6yE0X
@BTS_twt gave a speech at the UN headquarters, was awarded a cultural merit, attending the grammys. They are on a different league, why do I even bother about kpoppies opinion
people often think that “oh bts is just another ‘plastic’ kpop group” have u not seen how much theyve helped the youth, worked with unicef, gave a speech in the un, raised millions of cash not for themselves but for other people. id list all the things but ill turn into an essay
remember after the un speech where people were lining up to meet bts we're gonna see post malone and shawn queueing up for a bts hi-touch
2017 Skit: Billboard Music Awards Speech 2018 Skit: UN Speech 2019 Skit: Grammys @BTS_twt #BTSxGRAMMYs
I’m a UN ARMY I became one after RM’s Speech at the United Nations @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/MicheBangtan/status/1092613139919704069 …
they literally mocked bts un speech saying it's just a way to promote their albums eye- pic.twitter.com/xRsCk59Ezp
BBMAS AMAS UN SPEECH ORDER OF CULTURE MERIT AWARD STADIUM TOURS BB200 #1 ALBUM AND NOW GRAMMYS If you still haven't stanned bts I don't know what to say anymore #BTSxGrammys @BTS_twt
Me too! their first performance I’ve seen was Idol at AGT but became an ARMY after the UN speech they won me over and knew I have to support them with all my heart
Actually I knew about them since HYYH era, my mom showed me "Fire" when it came out (she stanned them since Dark & Wild) but I always ignored her :( the UN speech changed my life, all thanks to my 40 something mom who made ME an army
from performing & winning awards at amas & bbmas, giving a speech at the UN general assembly and now, attending the prestigious grammys 2019 IS INDEED BTS' YEAR AND I CAN'T BE MORE HAPPIER TO WITNESS SUCH A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR THEM #BTSXGrammys
I decided to stan after their UN speech so...
BTS 2013: we want to debut BTS 2014: we want first win BTS 2015: got their first ever win BTS 2016: first daesang BTS 2017: first BBMAs award & first stage performance at AMAs BTS 2018: BBMAs first performance, UN speech, BB hot 100, Daesangs 2019: GRAMMY @BTS_twt #BTSxGRAMMYs
Omg tq you are an intellectual n if you have time could you try to listen BTS speech at un it's really inspiring n motivating
-BB200 record -BB Hot 100 record -2 time BBMA TSA winner -a comeback stage at BBMAs -AMA performance -TIME mag cover -UN Speech -Grammy museum -guestings w/ Ellen, Corden, Fallon etc -sold out stadiums -now presenting an award at the GRAMMY BTS are making history #BTSxGrammy
I hate how y'all uglies praise kpop artists for doing the BARE MINIMUM like wearing rainbow shirts or something then we have bts always doing projects like love yourself campaign, giving meaningful speech in the UN, apologize for their ignorance Y'all: RM wore dreads
The UN speech really made an impact on me because of Namjoons words and the message @BTS_twt aimed to spread @BooBearPetal
i— funny how a wHOLE NAMJOON told the whole world in his UN speech to SPEAK YOURSELF. also, bts have been inserting political and social messages since debut. are you even an army? stream dna thanks, we’re slow af. we need to get to 1B views.
Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself. © BTS speech at the UN General Assembly pic.twitter.com/NjAoD1OHAi
joon literally made a UN speech about speaking up for yourself and loving yourself no matter your identity bts have done their own UNICEF anti violence campaign bts have donated to a number of charitable causes including schools i know americans tend to do more but it’s bc https://twitter.com/KGROUPCONFESS/status/1092533526212300802 …
The most memorable thing that i think is the UN speech Kim Namjoon really out there saying the most comforting words and inspiring me to do better @AvaCelesteD @NAYNAAWANLA
UN Speech, I could not stop crying by watching @BTS_twt @KNam_twt @WW_Jinnie
We didn't bring a group that has nothing to do with it, call them out, sure, but don't bring bts into it or say their message was "easily" accepted, when people even made fun of their un speech
The ones trashing your group aren’t even ARMYs, they’re probably the same type of people that dragged BTS’ UN speech. Y’all are picking fights with the wrong people...
YALL TODAY THEY HAD A WHOLE ASSEMBLY ABOUT BTS AND THEY PLAYED IDOL AS WE LEFT THE HALL HEKDJD I ACTUALLY ALMOST CRIED NO JOKE BC THEY ALSO PLAYED NAMJOON’S SPEECH AT THE UN AND LISTED THEIR ACHIEVMENTS JDKDK

Im looking back at why I started following BTS, it started when I first watched their UN speech where Namjoon spoke and I was in awe of their message.Their meaningful messages that they put in everything they do, that’s why I love them.
I love it when my non army friends ask me why BTS were on the Times magazine or why they might be nominated for a peace prize if they “haven’t done anything”. I’m over here like WELL IF YOU DIDNT KNOW THEY GAVE A SPEECH AT THE UN and WORK WITH UNICEF” and the look on their faces
truly unbelievable. speech in UN was just really on another level
I dreamed with the @BTS_twt prom party yesterday but it was like I was following BTS everywhere in some place that looked like UN speech behind the scenes... idk n then it was the prom party n when I was choosing my dress my mom woke me up to work...
Okay but to this day the UN speech feels like a fever dream like wtf that really happened ?? BTS really did that???

Yall remember when Kim Namjoon held a speech at the UN? He really did that @BTS_twt
maybe they're insecure bcs joon got to lead bts at young age, has 148 IQ, can compose songs, can make cool af beats, can dance, can sing, can rap fast than our internet connection, loves crabs, speech at UN, and the lists goes on.. basically, better than what they all can do.. https://twitter.com/adrift_mp3/status/1091964248174063616 …
I watched Namjoon's UN speech and I'm crying again @BTS_twt
Whether or not you're a fan of the world-famous Kpop group, BTS, the group leader's (RM) speech about self-love at the UN General Assembly last year touched our hearts & that's why his speech went viral. So, let's talk about self-love shall we? pic.twitter.com/GuQPnzd2VD
NOT @HOW WE HAD A WHOLE BTS COMPREHENSION PAPER LAST WEEK AND LIKE MY TEACHER SHOWED THE UN SPEECH VIDEO IN CLASS AND THEN ASKED WHO WENT TO THE BTS CONCERT AND EVERYONE POINTED AT ME KSJDHDLS
i think it's from the UN speech bangtan bomb when namjoon was reading his speech
"have u influenced ur family abt @BTS_twt yet?" IDK but: •sis beenbts choreo •bro dislike kpop but hve bts songs •6yo cousin can identify bts & chant •mom print me copy of RM UN speech when she heardtalking abt it •grandma brought home celery bcs she said bts eating it.
can meleis who bash armys and bts like it's their hobby list out their contributions that they have done that is WAY better than the group that have given a SPEECH at the UN? can they? that's what I thought. pic.twitter.com/JDOLA12f1Z
sometimes i forget that bts made a un speech....like.....they did that....... pic.twitter.com/QSd29olfZ0
if i saw people especially meleis, throw bts under the bus, i will spam bts lyrics, achievement, and inspired un speech under their comments
So the other day i rted unicefs tweet of bts speech at the un meeting. My mom follows me on twt and so clear to say My mom approves . love ya if you see this.
Honestly BTS being invited to the UN and giving a speech was more than what I could’ve imagined for them. They’re already way far above than any other artist out there so idec what happens in the future bc they’ve already done way more than anyone else out there
From UN Ambassadors for Love Yourself Campaign to their UN Speech And a cover for Time Mag. For being the youngest Awardee for Cultural Merit Award in Korea Now #BTSxNobelPeaceNominee?? BTS, what's next?? Im truly, genuinely, emotionally proud of you OT7. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xdnhsQVA3n
namjoon: ok boys we've spoken a speech at the UN, are nominated for the grammys and now the noble peace prize, what can we aim for next? yoongi: global domination rest of bts: [already taking down notes] #BTSxNobelPeaceNominee @BTS_twt

The UN Speech is one and if not THE biggest power move Bts has ever made. That day i realized how much of an impact bts has and just how big their platform is and the good they use it for. Had EVERYBODY watching
UN speech, Grammy and Nobel Peace normination? BTS is truly new generation leaders
okay but how weird is it gonna be for someone to see bts in history textbooks in the future w pics of them looking all smart n shit like the un speech and then they turn the page and there’s a whole sub section talking bout how much fucken gay porn is written about them
IMAGINE BTS GETTING A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE THO, JUST WHEN WE ALL THOUGHT THAT THE UN SPEECH WAS B I G pic.twitter.com/CNlCEiPHBd
Just like how I never shutted up about their UN speech
I know many army were joking about this nobel prize since UN speech... But never thought our boys really could be nominated for it... Watch out army for whatever you dream about... Its may turn out real... #BTSxNobelPeaceNominee
Omg yes!!! His speech at the UN was beautiful and so powerful, so just imagine what his speeches would be like as a president!
kpop stans don't have anything on bts so they just keep bringing up shit from 2013 to drag them & defend their racist favs fucking up in this day & age. if only they streamed namjoon's un speech!! their racist favs could never
I haven't edited a video since RM's UN speech, until today. Maybe I should've done this before now.
Joonie's UN speech which got me into him n BTS had this quote n it had struck me the hardest. Maybe because I always struggled with my faults n flaws. N today I got this card in a surprise giveaway. Our north east armys are so talented and have worked so hard. Thank you babies pic.twitter.com/hCz9M3mpjQ
Regarding the misogynistic lyrics that bts apparently used or said , koreanexposé need to bare in ming that bts are human too. They're not the most perfect beings on earth. They too make mistakes and they're learning from it. In the UN speech , rm said himself he is learning pic.twitter.com/m4zWSCYGdy
'love yourself era was a dissapointment,u only hyped it bc it's bts'- okay Susan? if an era that has given us a speech at UN,a Grammy nomination,a record breaking cinema release,US stadium concert AND helped thousands of armys all over the world is a flop to you then okay i guess
I can proudly say my mom properly recognizes Jin and Joon well cuz acc to her Jin is the one "I always keep sketching" and Joon is "the one who gave that UN speech" I'm so proud of my mom :3 Oh and her favorite song is Airplane Pt 2 #LoveYourselfinSeoulFilminIndia @BTS_twt
Hopefully he seen the UN speech
Another possible reason BTS is doing well in the US is the appeal for the young progressive Americans. They not-so subtly showed their support for the LGBT in their UN speech. And more subtly in their different interviews with the whole boyfriend girlfriend thing. As well as- pic.twitter.com/EzhPZKF23L
'i have to go nom-nom' SO YOURE SAYING THAT THIS IS WORLDWIDE GROUP BTS'S LEADER? THE PERSON WHO HAS MILLIONS IN HIS ACCOUNT AND OVER A HUNDRED WRITTEN SONGS IN HIS BELT? THE MAN WHO ONCE HAD A SPEECH IN A UN CONFERENCE? THE FEARSOME PRODUCER/RAPPER, A MONSTER IN LYRIC WRITING?
Ive showed him the UN speech Namjoon made and all the good things BTS has done and I still get smart remarks.
lmao imagine stanning bts whose leader said basically that no matter ur gender identity ur valid in his un speech yet degrading nd mocking nb lesbians Pls can they come off private nd acknowledge what they’ve done wrong

different people have different reason for stanning musicians I mean , I stanned bts from jk shirt lift in fake love My neighbor started stanning from the UN speech It is easy to stan , but if the music ain’t good , you can as easily unstan or stay for the visuals , no biggie
when I say BTS have a positive influence they really do...I'll be presenting my speech next week and the topic i chose is "SPEAK YOURSELF" I got inspired my namjoon's speech at the UN and it just have a special place in my heart along with their music. I'm so nervous tho @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ZswYnY1vWR
Watching Namjoon's UN Speech while headed towards my last psychology exam ever is giving me quite the mindset boost. Thank you for leaving us with tools to use for loving ourselves, @BTS_twt.
yo. winner of 2018 bbmas, speech giver on UN, receiver of Order of Cultural Merit, BB200 twice chart topper @BTS_twt says hello
#NamjoonAppreciationTime that day I watched Namjoon's UN speech, I asked my self "wth am I doing with my life" and cried a lot. That was the most difficult phase in my life. YOU AND @BTS_twt ARE SUCH AN INSPIRATION. YOU GUYS ARE.
u know what makes me angry.. i wanted to tell my ex about how namjoons un speech w his "gender identity" rly made me happy and it helps me when im questioning stuff and they just like... "yeah i dont keep up w anything bts related anyway why are u talking to me like this" and yea
I can't believe it's been months since bts were at the UN giving their speech. I still so fucking proud.
my mom doesn’t get why i like bts so tonight’s the night where i show her namjoons UN speech. i’ll keep u posted
Imagine being named after a person who shookt the world for his UN speech promoting the love for oneself and the accrptance diversity ... What an honor for both sides. @BTS_twt & Baby Joonie.. Go off @TheJose8A
the fact that bts had a speech at the un just hit me really hard again i'm so proud of bts i might cry
That’s the moment that I started to Stan bts! I had known about them for a while, and had a respect for them. But when I watched the un speech and heard namjoon say that, that’s when I finally decided “alright, I’ll give them a shot-“ and fell in love :’)
My sister and I told my mom about BTS going to UN General Assembly. First she was like, "Oh okay". But when she actually watched it on CNN that morning, her reaction, " Wow, BTS REALLY gave a speech at the UN". SHE WAS AMAZED.
I love how some armys preach bts’ UN speech and brag about their campaign with unicef but bully anyone that disagrees with them
@Blankismael @ldrnjms My favorite BTS memory is the UN speech and when they won many awards
remember when bts gave a speech at the UN. me too. wow legends.
My fav memory of BTS is when they went to the UN and speech about "Find Your Voice" @fdkedua @cchusnul20_ pic.twitter.com/RrBQI8rKAW
im still ????? about the fact that they made articles like "bts are the first KPOP group to make a speech at the UN!!" LIKE
Omg I just rewatched BTS's UN speech, and I have just now realized how beautiful Namjoon's speech was. The topics he talked about, his intonations, just the overall speech was amazing! I almost cried hehehehe + pic.twitter.com/vkj0WaaQCM
I woke up today and couldn’t stop saying “I love bts” I watched their interviews & the un speech and listened to their solos I couldn’t stop I had such a huge smile on my face it was disgusting but I swear idk why I was like that but I’m happy they can make me feel like that ughh
BTS OFC Taun lalu: -bbmas TSA -BBMAs performer -UN SPEECH -6m sales/ 1year -amas -AGT -the biggest boy band in the universe -daesang++, YT, ETC
These days on every night,i look at the white ceiling and ponder about things i could have done and i always recall the moment your speech at UN,it made me feel better that i can always make mistakes but i can also prove better me.Thank you Namjoon
"Stop bragging". And then his fandom is the first that boasts of having the most viewed MV kpop - blog -. At least we can boast of so much else, such as the fantastic speech at the UN, the top social artist to billboards for two consecutive years. And much more.
I remember that time is after midnight. I cannot sleep. There were 2 days i remember I cannot sleep. First during BTS UN speech and 2nd during the Citifield ticket sales and I am not even an American who will going to buy the ticket.
one day i will forever remember and will tell my grandchildren is that BTS went to the UN and gave their speech, Namjoon was so nervous his hands were shaking, the memebers were so captivated by what everyone who spoke was saying, the way they stood behind Joon to support him.
I finally met my US-based male cousins again after 5 years and they are so supportive of my love for @BTS_twt that I literally cried tears of joy. I expected to be judged but they gave me nothing but understanding. One of them even said that he saved RM's UN speech on his mobile.
Oh, and you should probably check out this speech that @BTS_twt's RM (Kim Namjoon) gave at the UN on self-love and speaking your truth too. #BellLetsTalk #LoveYourselfhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
Today I shared a UN speech, intro to OU2L8 and BTS concept trailer, with translation of the group name and short description of their concept: protecting youth, fighting inequality, being a friend you can count on in hard times.
From RM of @BTS_twt UN Speech: “Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin color, gender identity... Speak yourself” #BellLetsTalkpic.twitter.com/dep8wcFazt
30/365 I had lunch with Syaf. She asked me how i was doing n i said ive never been better. Proudly told her how bts love yourself series pushed me to achieve this state I shared abt bts poetic lyrics + joons speech in UN n that hit her bc she rly needed to hear those words pic.twitter.com/S035slKmU9
The un speech and all the great international achievements of our favorite idols @BTS_twt @alba134340 @Aaru_91
Yes, but remember that DDU DU DDU DU has overcome DNA and therefore blackpink are better than the bts, who gave a speech at the UN, which have sold millions of albums not only in Korea, but all over the world and that have created masterpieces.
omg ok so we were watching bts's UN speech during eng jn, and out of nowhere some guys in my class started saying things like they're fake/plastic etc etc, when literally no one asked ?? why are y'all being so defensive and triggered like calm down m8 geez
BTS& BigHit Joined with Unicef to stage the campaign Love Myself as part of the larger global campaign #EndViolence. During it,they have continued to spread their positive influence,such as with the UN General Assembly ‘Speak Yourself’ speech. @BTS_twt #BTSFanQuiz #AreYouBTSNo1Fanpic.twitter.com/IHfoGO3UeH
if the new bts album has a skit called “skit: namjoon un speech” im gonna fucking lose it
I looked at her Dad in judgement. "Sir, it's BTS. They're Korean. & no other Korean group have had the honor to deliver a speech in the UN & that's what sets them apart from this xenophobic society." Jane was like "ignore him, it was not that offending anyway". Excuse ME??? NEway pic.twitter.com/eYk06e5KBT
To anyone who has issues with selflove and selfrespect - just watch and listen to @BTS_twt UN speech https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg #BellLetsTalk
@BTS_twt prepare yourself joon im sending a bunch of letter on HOW YOU ARE A BLEESSING TO HUMAN KIND AND WHAT YOU SAID ON THE UN SPEECH CHANGED MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLES PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE. AND INSPIRED US TO SPEAK AND DREAM. https://twitter.com/mononamu/status/1089948549889093632 …
@BTS_twt Hey Namjoon I just have a question about your UN speech. Like a legitimate question, but your DMs arent open. Any way I can contact you?
@BTS_twt Remember the UN speech Namjoon made... Even though none of my family/friends know abt BTS, I put up the link to his speech as my whatsapp status, in hopes that someone would watch it and get to know them but I didn't think about it much bc no one really cared... But + pic.twitter.com/YCfRwtiRZu
My mom messaged me the randomest question & I thought it warranted a crowdsourced answer. "What starter video should I post if I wanted non-BTS folks to know about them?" I initially said--their UN speech, but I'm interested to see suggestions. YT only for now. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/7HDj69Ciic
Let them see namjoon's UN speech first and explain why they're not the typical boy band. Then dive in to their mv's. Starting off with fire and bs&t, not today, fake love etc. And dance practices like danger, boynluv, i need u etc.
@btbtbts1234567 @NamJoonie_2U My Favorite #BTS memory from 2018 was when they went to the UN meeting, and namjoon gave the most wonderful speech! pic.twitter.com/4q5bf8m4us
@BTS_twt receiving at least 7 awards in every ceremony, making a speech at UN, getting a Grammy nomination and being on top of billboard's charts twice a year https://twitter.com/spacebcctz/status/1089683521193590784 …
I introduced my friend, who is a nerd, in an unconventional way.. before showing the videos, I made her listen to Namjoon's speech at the UN I knew it would get her since that's what got me hooked. She was super impressed & now BTS is on her playlist All the best
All that has happened since LY: Answer....us stadium show, TIMES cover, UN Speech.....whew we are NOT ready for the numbers bts about to pull in the U.S. for their upcoming album
my mom talking with her friend on the phone: "yeah tinas good too, we're watching bts rn, they were on un gave a speech, came out on times too, were in new york and made a lot of tv appearances. we watched it all, we know it all" kdkxkxjdjdjd
Hmm! “Bts fans” never talk about serious stuff when bts themselves just recently gave a speech at the 73rd UN General Assembly for the launch of UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited initiative and had the hugest impact while discussing the importance of self love and how important it is
Ofc...Blackpink got 20 Daesang, order of cultural merit, speech at UN, Citifield sold out, #1 at BB200 2 times in row, and top10 Hot100. BTS who?
My favorite #bts memory of 2018 is the UN speech pic.twitter.com/eGREmbdvfk @fatimazia40 @Amnaanjum8pic.twitter.com/nEva1IyCjP

ever heard of UNICEF? or @bts_love_myself & END VIOLENCE project? yeah BTS is donating their hard earned money on this & thats why they were called to give speech in UN, but u dont have to know this bcz u need to study & learn about it yet.
"What excite you? What makes your heart beat?" - Kim Namjoon a.k.a RM of @BTS_twt at UN speech 2018 https://twitter.com/legend2817/status/1089868105667526658 …
He should watch BTS speech on UN, it's completely in englush and it's spreading their message which they follow in latest 3 albums
There're so many happy memories about BTS from 2018, but if I have to choose one, it would be speech at the UN. Watching them giving a speech, make me feel so proud @baejk01 @aidatunnur73pic.twitter.com/4WT9qwcZDU
okay but what if bts' next theme is speak yourself and they put the UN speech as their skit
This writer of this article might have only skimmed through RM's UN speech and missed the part when he said that he made plenty of mistakes in the past. To be philosophical about it, BTS did not give a speech but a testimony that despite committing errors in the past, they were pic.twitter.com/x5DlAHqgyR

I just had an actual break down about RM’s UN speech. Man, let me tell you that guy has real power I swear... Nobody in my family understands me. They think I’m crazy and stupid for liking @BTS_twt and I hate it.
Think the mediaplay is getting to their head and their hallucinating a wall to block BTS' Bb200 #1's bbh100 top tens, 2B overall spotify streams that only top artists get grammy nom, Un speech, Bbmas n amas stage, critically acclaimed albums sold out world tours-
@BTS_twt I was listening to reflection in the a few days ago and I realised how happier namjoon is now than when he was when he released reflection. After he released trivia love and did his speech at the UN last year, he looks genuinely more happier and I love that. I love—
xenophobic 1d stans getting brave about bts again huh.... anyways stream namjoon’s un speech :*
Guys help me out I’m going a 3 minutes presentation in front of 50 people and I’m changing my topic to bts what should I talk about?? I was thinking maybe joons UN speech and maybe the love myself campaign
BTS gave a speech at the UN and lunched a love myself campaign #Only_BTS_Can
Things that just made my day. I thought of Namjoons UN speech. I played Jin's high notes in my head. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/FHYRTob1q0
Last year we achieved many feats without even aiming for them. UN speech, cultural award r some of the gr8test examples. Some of it was a by-product of their bb200. So we just need to break charts & make ppl listen to their works. @BTS_twt 's music itself & karma will do the rest
Love you #Namjoon i remember that #Jimin almost died when he saw Namjoon practicing his UN speech @BTS_twt
This can be your UN speech.
@BTS_twt After I see them,listen their music,I open my heart,touch the world , I think my life is more colorful, thank u bts , thank u UN,RM speech is so inspiring .(my english is not well .) https://twitter.com/UNICEF_ECA/status/1089168051839356929 …
Done thank you so much for this ga The UN speech and also the fact that when they visited my home country Finland, they visited many places where I have been so many times I'll tag @sHbandaddiction and @MinRayven pic.twitter.com/xMvS2vkGwr
BTS is only who go in UN Give speech & this becomes many people inspiration pic.twitter.com/ipsQRNOjJs
namjoon rly is that person who sheltered all the members, brought them all together, leaded them through their careers, wrote meaningful lyrics for his band, made a speech at the UN, became the initial spark for BTS as a group, and took care of all the members
. @BTS_twt are celebrated for their bb main charts achievements, un speech, grammy museum interview & nom for an album, sold out stadium concert in the us, time mag cover, nat'l economic impact in sk & knowing that nothing can take it away from them makes me sleep soundly at night
I just want to bring back this iconic speech. Namjoon UN speech inspires me so much @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/2ws6zXw8AC
BTS Armies..report this asshole already Let's get him suspended! His band just gave a speech at UN..won the billboard Music awards...is the biggest boy band in the world right now with millions of fans which Toxic Indian Men like u with fragile masculanity can't even dream of! https://twitter.com/Kanatunga/status/1089118207716163584 …
#Only_BTS_Can speech at the UN
I just had a 30 minute discussion with my dad about BTS, how they have influence all pver the world, especially the youth. I talked about how they have very powerful fans, and that they have changed their lives through their music. I evem talked about their UN speech---
album sales, popularity, awards, concerts, movies, UN speech, book, webtoons, ads, merchandise, even fabric softener. All of these were topped by @BTS_twt . It is indeed a #BTS world. #Only_BTS_Can #BTS
Yes, I agree with your observations. They are maturing and becoming more confident in expressing themselves. Maybe the comeback concept could even be "Speak Yourself" since those words were used in the UN speech. I'll be here for whatever they choose!
I was talking abt joon's speech at the UN w a Korean friend and she said she doubted bts were qualified to give a speech and I started explaining what their message was and what they have done and at the end she was like:"oh I understand it now" and then she asked me my fav track

I was last June, but I didn't do social media until September (the day of the UN speech actually), so until then I was just randomly bouncing around learning about these 7 wonderful men on my own lol. I don't know when ARMY are no longer "new", but I sure still feel like I am!

Also, before you say ydc about YT likes. BTS isn't only about YT likes. They've got a Grammy nom, they gave a speech at the UN for the meaningful lyrics in their songs, increased their country's economy by 3.5B and broke into the US with Korean lyrics. 1* can't relate sksksk.
I'm coming from future... They topped Billboard 200 with consecutive 2 albums in the same year and gave speech at UN and they received order of cultural merit award with only 5 years of experience
we have this thing in my english class every friday, where we choose quotes and talk about them i chose this quote from namjoon's un speech. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/pP8BFXJMVv
wow becoming BTS at UN speech now?
So this man, namjoon that rap so fast and speech to un is actually the same person right here? Don't joke pls
I also had a dream where Namjoon was in the same seminar I attended and he was like one of the speakers lol everybody swarmed to him asking for autographs but I just stood watching him from afar. Idk. I had that dream after the his UN speech sjjsjsj
For an assessment at uni we have to create a piece based on a news article and you bet I wanna do mine on BTS, their UN speech and love yourself message so if you know any good news articles please send me links
It could! It has stayed with me Namjoon's UN speech. Speaking yourself it's like standing up for yourself, when you do so you are able to do what's right, for you and for others, in many cases becoming your own hero.
its the video ive used to introduce my mom dad and cousin to bts (+UN speech) and now my cousin really likes then
I am listening to #RM and #V @BTS_twt #4OClock right now. I still remember #RM speech at the UN about speaking yourself and loving yourself. I feel so alone and so sad right now. And im trying to cheering myself up.

This reminds me of that army who went somehwere with no internet connection for like 1 year and when she came back she was so in shock of the things bts achieved she kept replaying the namjoon UN speech
I was telling him about the UNICEF campaign, UN speech, Hyundai Palisade, the concerts, cultural merit award, BTS meeting the president of SK, how they literally started from the bottom and still going up (especially Yoongi's story bcoz i know he can pretty much relate to it)
i take an oral interp class and im going to try to go to district and state competitions. we use prose and poetry pieces, and i want to do Namjoons UN speech or the notes from hyyh. hhh i really want to use BTS for my pieces but im nervous
I really love the UN BTS episode because Jungkook was literally everywhere near Namjoon while he was practicing the speech.
YALL im at this mun conference and a group standing next to me is arguing over bts' speech at the UN

I don't know when I wrote this but I'm sure, I was truly inspired with @BTS_twt Namjoon's UN speech. MASK I talk so loud and laugh out loud; Yet deep inside my heart is empty. Still trying to convince myself that this world is pretty. ++
That's so sweet... The boys are so cute but they are also socially conscious, if you want please check their speech at the UN Also, sorry for your mentions, we get excited when people talk about BTS Have a great day https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg

BTS has helped me to love myself more and be confident about myself, especially through this love yourself era when they literally show us that loving yourself is the greatest gift from all kind of love. And Namjoon's speech at UN, it really touches my heart, they're just amazing pic.twitter.com/kzliWz0MUz
Well BTS did perform in front of their president and performance in a french concert to help the friendship with Korean . They also spoke at the UN , you should hear the speech it's so inspiring !!
was a side view photo of RM and man!!! I was so furious but still calmly said to the agent: do you know who you're mocking? That's THE PRESIDENT KIM NAMJOON of BTS. How dare you make fun of him. Have you been to the UN to make a speech? NO. Have you ever written songs? NO +
[at bighit’s auditions] BigHit: Why are you auditioning? Beomgyu: BTS have shown me I’ve reasons I should love myself, sir. Beomgyu: I wanted to speak myself, as Namjoon hyung said in his un speech, and follow my dreams. BigHit: [nodding] BTS, from afar: [in tears] Hire him.
I agree with everything you said. I want to share that RM is the reason I got into BTS. I saw his speech at UN and I became so interested with how his mind works. It's not reiterated much, but RM really is different and special. I hope more ppl realize that + appreciate him more
Guys... there’s a french video where people are asked « BTS or exo? » and a girl said...... she stopped stanning bts when they did their speech at the UN because she thinks they do POLITICS.......... WHEN IT WAS A WHOLE ASS SPEECH ABOUT DREAMS AND YOUTH?????
bts 5 yrs after debut has already gone to the un to give a speech on youth empowerment, received cultural merit from sk govt, 2 no. 1 albums in the us, a kma musician of the yr daesang, sold out citifield (a us stadium) in minutes, etc so stop downplaying them pls uknee
Idk, OP didn't mention any members name..maybe it offended solo stans and other K-pop fans tho.. I've seen many biased accounts writes like "my bias is the best--","If my bias wasn't in bts,--"..And think about it. the impact was HUGE after his UN speech. The book that he read-
Y’all love claiming all of Joons lyrics as BTS work but when we praise joon for being the mind behind BTS amazingly poetic and touching lyrics all of a sudden we are solo stans. When it comes to the UN speech it becomes BTS gave such a moving message but no Joon did.
May we all remember Dr King and his important legacy today. Without him, President NamJoon could not have made that UN speech.
I COME BACK HOME TO THE INFORMATION THAT MY MOM MADE MY DAD WATCH ALL OF BTS LIVE PERFORMANCES AND THEIR UN SPEECH IM AKSJJDHDHDHDHD pic.twitter.com/KB7Xrqaonj
just like what RM says on his speech on UN General Assembly
It’s not just the lyrics, it’s his charisma and his speeches. I haven’t seen (so far) a group leader or any kpop group who give speeches like that. Do you think BTS will have this big impact if not for the UN? The speech was amazing. Give credit where credit is due.
y'all kpop stans literally call TSA a paper award, call bts' daesangs are charity, saying the UN speech is just a way for bts to promote their album pic.twitter.com/oukzDcMiyW
A memorable moment with @BTS_twt is tearing up while watching UN speech @bangtanmylife @taetae_skn
feelings and care treat each other and army let People feel so healed. In 2018, they even delivered a speech at the un, participating in the new plan of the United Nations children's fund for the world's youth. In front of diplomats and leaders of many countries, BTS is fluent--
they said they were translating bts songs and the un speech in Arabic for their mother to understand .. still wondering why you’re blocked tho
i just translated 6 bts songs and joons UN speech to arabic so my mom can understand it

BTS UN Speech Sept 2018 https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Did I listen epiphany, promise, magic shop and BTS' UN speech to stop feeling like sh it? Yes I did. And I DO feel better what would I do without them
Omg why are you still awake?!?! Also that’s a BTS Episode which is almost like Bangtan bombs only longer and with a theme or central event like behind mv shoots, billboard 2017, UN speech, etc. So maybe that can be where you pick up after Bangtan bombs
I'm curios...can u list the same achievement that BTS have achieved so far with the kpop group that u have mentioned?like UN speech, BBMAs, AMAs, GRAMMY, cultural award, KMA?anything, thank you
BTS: *speech at UN about youth and how people should love themselves* Other artists: *plays song on little pony* Yeah compare the incomparable.
What bts is known for: first korean group with two #1’s on bb 200, UN speech, unicef ambassadors, top 10 song on bb, 2 longest charting bg songs on melon, generations leaders What your favs are known for: media playing with bts’ achievements
a memorable moment was when i was watching @BTS_twt UN speech in my statistics class and i almost cry in front of everyone uwu @silvanaspeaks @jkookfabs @njshoney
Bts: perform at Citi field, speech at UN, Grammy nom, riaa certified Them: yeah well YG artist PARTIED with Justin Bieber
Anyway stan world's biggest boy band who got a GRAMMY nom, gave speech at UN, sold out City Field, made their company the richest of SK: BTS aka LEGENDS pic.twitter.com/HdVbabl785
When did anyone say BTS was "the first in America"? Never I guess. BTS was the first kpop group to attend BBMA and AMA, the first kpop act to held a speech at the UN, the first kpop act to win 13 Daesangs in a year, the most Album selling Kpop act.
BTS got more meaningful achievements such as UN Speech to RIAA certifications to 5-Million Album Sales(Best selling kpop album of the century) to Sold-out concerts without 80%sponsored seats and dedicated(non-lazy) members, and even wonderful fans called ARMY ..<3
Chill mate !... BTS got more meaningful achievements such as UN Speech to RIAA certifications to 5-Million Album Sales(Best selling kpop album of the century) to Sold-out concerts without 80%sponsored seats and dedicated(non-lazy) members, and even wonderful fans called ARMY ..<3
He can speak and understand intermediate level English. He is into advance English now. Remember when he saw Namjoon's UN speech script? He saw the words and he understood some of them at a glance that is why he reacted that way. He studies really hard.
for me it was my first comeback and it was when i met a lot of really nice people and we all celebrated @BTS_twt ,,,, also the UN speech really made an impact on me @yunamhope
Wow, that’s progress. We are still working on it in our house. We did get him to watch the UN speech. He even put that on his TL!
Most memorable moment is the UN speech they gave last year and it was such an honorable moment for them and us because we ARMYs are a part of it too..That's why Im very proud of our boys @BTS_twt @ILoove_OT7 @Gummy__Suga
All of them are famous, but Jimin get so much hype and attention in Korea since 2017 I think. And Namjoon is the most well know cause he is the leader and his speech in UN. Jungkook is popular cause he is the center in everything, he always receive more than the others.
A few people have messaged me to ask why there’s no mention of the Unicef campaigns or the UN speech – there were initially, but my editor cut them both. I did keep a link to the BTS Episodes of the UN speech in there though. pic.twitter.com/mHrlGYy6q9
i would like to thank namjoon and his UN speech who helped me the most and i’m not even kidding, @BTS_twt love h
their speech at the UN really inspired me and i cried while listening to it for the first time lol. AND ALL THE MEMES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE NEW WEBTOON THAT CAME OUT LOL pic.twitter.com/07ZHLELYsN
"An ARMY" then add the UN Speech of RM .... they will be scratching their heads but they will be smiling. But i believe this is a worthy assignment really.
My most memorable moment with them so far is the speech at UN and MAMA 2018 speech. These speeches touched my heart and truly strenghtened my bond with them. Also the moment i started to truly understand their music and feel the love/passion they have for music.
I think: if he’s a guy’s guy, Not Today or Mic Drop; if he’s an artsy/brainy guy, BST or Fake Love. And then the UN speech clip. Then appeal to his fun side with the Run Manito game.
and the UN speech as well because they've become ambassadors for the worldwide youth and time naming them next generation leaders It's okay I mean antis wouldn't be able to take it anyway if you're going to put all their achievements and it would be way too long
bts un speech still hits me whew
throwback to the time my teacher really played bs&t, the UN speech and Jimmy kimmel x BTS @BTS_twt . pic.twitter.com/LW3cGyYJTG
fun fact: the bts ellen interview was the first bts interview i ever watched (the UN speech isn't an interview so i'm not counting it).
3 videos are required, w/ an optional 4th. I wanted to make it 2 required, either the “Idol Explained” video or the Live Performance, but I felt that watching the Explained was important for the assignment. & I feel including the UN Speech is a good to discuss cultural impact.
BTS even held a speech at the UN about their message (love yourself, speak yourself) and are ambassadors of Unicef (namjoons speech) the next song is 2!3! (mentions how the fans sing the end alone at concerts while bts is listening on stage)
I am working on my English and Spanish oral, and for the myth and hero's nocion I will talk about BTS and especially RM and his speech at the UN How they are today's heroes towards young people
“And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, But Yesterday’s me is still me” Kim namjoon - UN speech @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/QC2vgAOoW5
I very recently got introduced to BTS, just last October after their UN speech. I checked out Idol’s MV & I was so fascinated, I watched it on repeat for a few days & Jungkook kept catching my eye. That’s when I decided to look up their names & know more about them. The 2nd
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/oL0f1tqsUYA?a [Eng Es PT Sub] Korean News - BTS on UN Speech, Fallon, GMA 180927
Y’all I actually can’t believe BTS are really making history, like they’re doing things (speech at UN, webtoons, selling out stadiums in 10 minutes, etc) that other groups have never done before. Ppl say BTS are overrated when they’re outselling your favs by MILLIONS. #SAVE_MEpic.twitter.com/ssBWwjkpXo
It's perhaps not the best photo of them, but I think it's the most memorable moment. The speech at the UN is something unique! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/RgMBz0CFTR
Stop they played; Fire 2, 3 BST And talked about the UN speech @BTS_twt
Everyone this is BTS. Youngest recipient of Cultural Merit Award , Next generation Leaders , Gave speech at UN and were nominated for Grammys and is dominating the world @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/daintyjimn/status/1085479013777211397/video/1 …
but it's fine she won't ask for my handle she doesn't stan bts (but when i was translating Namjoon's speech at the UN, she read it and watched a bit of the video and she said he speaks so well and he's good at English and he's reallyyy handsome so i'm not mad cjsbxnsjsj)
[putting their fans as first priority] sept last year, when bts delievered a UN speech, they mentioned their fans first, saying "we have the best fans in the world"
my seatmate in class knew im an army and he said he was so amazed how namjoon learned to speak english with the sitcom friends and also said that his speech at un was amazing too. he doesnt know this but it means so much to me. seeing and hearing other people appreciate @BTS_twt

I was today years old when I read the lyrics of Answer: Love Myself and found out that Namjoon took parts of his UN speech from it "The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow (I’m learning how to love myself) With no exceptions, it’s all me" @BTS_twt
Hi y'all :D im going to the Woman's March in LA on saturday and wondering if anyone one has any ideas being either @BTS_twt lyrics or quotes to put on my poster (other than the UN speech :p) that I am taking (: if u hav any suggestions pls help thank you~
@Walmart step up Really Ninja posters. You need bts posters because Ninja hasn't done anything that great not like bts, bts had there speech at the un, won many awards, nominated for a Grammy and is the biggest boy group in the world and what had Ninja done, play Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/gxcic9AhjO
I have to choose a yearbook quote, so I chose something from the UN speech, but put the speaker as BTS instead of Kim N… — what quote? https://curiouscat.me/taehvungult/post/760848666?t=1547611275 …
i’m deadass about to use namjoon’s UN speech for my public speaking assignment @BTS_twt
Honestly I have so many stories. She’s so cute. I put up their MV’s and we were watching Dope but about halfway through I was like “ok I’m gonna show you the UN speech” and she’s like “NO WAIT let’s finish this first”
Let’s make a trend of #ThankYouTheLeaderRM for all the responsibilities he had taken well of #BTS in the last year 2018.Lets appreciate his leadership from his powerful UN speech to his emotional n wise words on all award ceremony, his encouragement to other members to speak up. pic.twitter.com/O4Bjo6h0nf
OK, I accept your opinion. but I also have my own opinion. Do those who are blacklisted have to be bullied? can't they forgive? sorry, but I still have a heart. Just remember Namjoon speech in UN too
So, in the beginning of the semester I made a presentation about BTS' speech at the UN, #ENDviolence, Love Yourself, and BTS' messages in their songs. I learned today that I got 20/20, I'm so happy I had to share it with you ARMY Thanks @BTS_twt, you inspire people everyday
idol stands for i'd do it all. bts have been proving exactly that. they do it all. writing composing producing singing rapping dancing performing acting variety shows philanthropy speech at the un receivers of the order of cultural merit and soon to be book characters
who else loves the part of intro where they played their mvs from '13-'18 w/ the bgm of answerlove myself the me of yesterday the me of today the me of tomorrow i'm learning how to love myself to be exact they even added @BTS_twt's UN speech at the end im notcrying u r #BTSatSMA
Me ha gustado un vídeo de @YouTube (http://youtu.be/-WNmdPIu37o?a - 190115 SMA 방탄소년단 BTS Winning Daesang Speech @28th Seoul
i love the fact that bts use their old mvs for vcrs because it's almost reiterating what joon said at the un speech : even their past them is still them. it's like them saying that even though, in the past, no one acknowledged them, that bts is still the bts that's big today.
Okay so, Am I the only one whose eyes welled up when they played Namjoon's UN speech?? That's some powerful shit right there. #BTSatSMA @BTS_twt

So they're not up to date to their current news too? BTS is they youngest achiever for Order of Cultural Merit for their country and they were invited to give speech for UN some more. What????
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak?a [ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy”
we were told to make a powerpoint about people who completed my 2018,, i included @BTS_twt and a vid of their UN speech and my teacher got curious about them so i told her things about them and how they encourage people to love theirselves. later that day, she told me she ++

Canadarmys, remember when BTS came here and no one even knew they arrived, they proceeded to have a week of activities and concerts and left peacefully to head to NY for the UN speech?? Wow, we really are THAT bitch
Some cute shit for the TL: So my friend knows very little about BTS, she & I live apart rn because of school but she’s truly my bestfriend She loves Joon (she calls him Namjoon cus of his UN speech) so I texted her & she sent me Jin pic.twitter.com/612U10D7GB
SO MY TEACHER LET ME PUT BTS AT THE UN SPEECH IN CLASS AND WE WATCHED IT!! Anyone interested so I write how it went??
same!! i have a friend who doesn't really care for bts but adores namjoon so much ?? she coos over my wallpaper and she once admitted she listened to his un speech on repeat bc she likes his voice so much
it’s actually the new UN speech being given by Obama and Namjoon, he stans BTS and wants the world to behave x x x
Last time BTS came back from US, after UN speech, got some GP attentions, ppl were saying it was only bcz of that controversy... This time they r getting attention for their albums, self composed music, world class performances, I wonder wht ppl has to say abt it again... .
@jiminschilipepr @yananshands my fav @BTS_twt moment was definitely the sense of pride and love we had for them having the opportunity to speak at the UN and delivering a beautiful and meaningful speech for our next generation pic.twitter.com/I3j7sp6wBd

Latina moms know their job!! My mom said that BTS is the only group that we have liked that don't care about fame and that care about others in the world. My mom EVEN cried hearing Namjoon's UN speech I love that our moms care so much for us and them. @BTS_twt
Aaah fictional story ok Im very sorry! And Im not homophobe and I know that bts arents homophobe. They even said it in the speech at the UN! But do you like them being gay?
UN speech definitely @BTS_twt
for real guys, before aku confess pun he asked me about bts, like he genuinely wanna know what the hype is all about so i briefly explained and even gave him the link to namjoon's un speech

wasn't there a time after bts' un speech where we all tweeted our actual names and who we were. idk if you did that at the time but maybe that's how they knew it
so many things happened last year..so many achievements bts have a chieved but my fav is still the UN speech and them being the youngest to recieved cultural merit award. :)) also sk president and bts interaction lmao

@BTS_twt Favourite moment is the UN speech
OMG JUST GOT AN IDEA! GONNA WRITE AN ARTICLE ON UNICEF LOVE MYSELF CAMPAIGN AND I WILL ADD BTS LY AND NAMJOON’s UN SPEECH IN IT !
Im writing an article for my last project in english and i think i want to write about namjoon’s UN speech and make it connect with self love and add UNICEF in it. Imma promote bts to my English class
How important and meaningful their lyrics and messages are. Shiw them Namjoon speech on UN, mention that he used the lyrics from theif songs and wrote this speech by himself. It's the best way to show to people BTS impact
you should defo talk about their UN speech about loving yourself and their campaign with UNICEF. also their records and the positive impact they've had on society & their fans.
when they are speech in UN. That's the best moments @BTS_twt
I made an essay about youth and what comes along and I just used their UN speech and what joon thought me through these years , stan BTS for good grades
I can't believe these kinda creatures stood behind me on my UN speech.
Lunch break for me is @BTS_twt time. I'm always glued to my phone watching twitter and youtube and my coworkers knew I'm in my BTS world again.. one of them got curious why i am so addicted to them. I just smiled and let him watched the UN speech.. pic.twitter.com/T6rgPVfhkJ
got to be the only student who got an A at my english class for a speaking test by doing a whole talk about how their music is positive and how they changed kpop’s perspective, even got my teacher to play the UN speech, who is now an army too bts really did get us good grades
The fact that I caught my mom watching RM's speech at the UN makes me really think @BTS_twt
most memorable are UN speech, they are feature in time magazine and receiving cultural merit award
My teacher is a fan of bts, she even showed to us, Namjoon Speech in UN infront of our class.
They' re a good man makes good music, with sincere lyrics. They collab UNICEF for LoveMyself Anti-Violence Campaign and it raises to up to $1.4 Million. Also, BTS Encourages Youth In Historic Speech At Launch Of UNICEF’s “Generation Unlimited” At The UN General Assembly.
-In a few days I'm turning in an essay based off of Joon's UN speech -Got an A on a writing about The Truth Untold story (Smeraldo Flower) -I'm turning in an essay based off of So Far Away -My mind always goes "what would Namjoon do?" When I do my writings - @BTS_twt O!RUPROUD2?

Sooo I might have made the best of my eng project and did a bts newspaper cover, main article was about the UN speech,, talked about it a bit and I asked to watch it and this stuff so the teacher told me bring it next time we’ll watch it in class!! I’m so happy,will update u pic.twitter.com/J3dl7KigF4
bts really went from having their names written on their shirts bc no one cared to remember their names to giving a motivational speech at the UN about speaking yourself and having an identity
No break ups but asked my 11 year old having confidence issues at school to listen to RM's UN speech on YouTube, over the Xmas break. She said it's one of the most uplifting speeches she's ever heard. Kudos to BTS for talking and singing about mental health issues.
Thanks a lot for the GA! @justneenasakura @poojapant615 All moments spent in this journey with @BTS_twt are special. When they gave their UN speech was probably when I felt extremely proud of being an ARMY. They are truly leaders of the young generation.
There're so many happy memories about BTS, but my favorite memories would be giving a speech at the UN. I smiling proudly to see them and their speech also so inspiring. I hope in 2019, a lot of happy memory will be made with ARMYs and BTS again @babesgiraffexx @lovlyhani1pic.twitter.com/DTVBAio0ww
I just recently found out that Kim Namjoon's speech at the UN General Assembly has the same contents with the lyrics of Answer: Love Myself. "The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow (I’m learning how to love myself) With no exceptions, it’s all me" + @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/hvAgIUL4QR
He totally does. I actively started following BTS after listening to Namjoon's speech at the UN. His maturity, passion, openess, his conviction, that came through his speech hit me hard. From that day onwards he has been a source of inspiration @BTS_twt
so i showed bts' un speech and also some lyrics translations to my mom i've never been proud she looks happy that her daughter stans the right men
For me personally it has to be @BTS_twt concert in Amsterdam. But overall I would agree that the UN speech was one of the greatest moments! Or the Citi Field concert - I felt so proud!
Baltic ARMY Reply with your favorite moment of 2018. Don’t forget to tag @BTS_twt in your replies! Also RT for Social 50! Mine is UN speech - pic.twitter.com/rQHh9SWlIt
My intuition is telling me that this group will win Billboard music awards twice, nominated in grammy, be the cover of TIME Magazine, do a stadium tour, give a speech at the UN, Promotes Self Love and helps a lot of people to heal. Will it be true? @BTS_twt
I don't have 2 friend to tag;) And best moments will be UN speech, BTS getting the presidential awards and Mama...
Thanks for the GA. My favorite memories would be BTS receiving the cultural merit award, being the cover of Time Mag and giving a speech at the UN. Our influential kings @future_min @thecyphergirlpic.twitter.com/Q9WsnwEl5m
Thank you for this thoughts, they echoed in my mind as I believe Namjoon was born a leader even when he didn’t know it. His UN speech touched me so deeply. I love him so much #mono included in my Spotify heavy rotations @BTS_twt I found this drawing, always so thoughtful pic.twitter.com/7OKOxXMY1z
my favorite bts moments were during their UN speech and their MAMA 2018 awards
My Elementary School kids had their graduation today, so the principal,. A middle aged Korean man, gave a speech congratulating them. He ended said speech by directly quoting Namjoon's UN speech, prefacing it as "Words from @BTS_twt leader Kim Namjoon at the UN." I was...OJO pic.twitter.com/7AlP1CFu1G

Listening to @BTS_twt UN speech again. I’m still glad that I followed my dream instead of my Mum’s. I’m always thankful
Thank you so much for giveaway.There are alot of bts favourite moments in 2018 but the most proud and memorable moment was when they were at UN at gave speech.Being an army i cant be more proud to have idols like #bts for me 2018 was like a dream each moment was memorable. pic.twitter.com/v8UHRl1XUB
when people joke around that I'm listening to kpop and fangirling at this age then know @BTS_twt as those guys who gave THAT speech at the @UN and then say what a beautiful speech it was. Me: Please... it's not kpop. it's #BTS here stream DNA https://youtu.be/MBdVXkSdhwU
so my love story with BTS started from my attraction to JK from that AGT Idol perf. so started watching all their MVs looking for JK when I saw him at Airplane pt. 2 video I know I’m hooked but only became an ARMY when I saw RMs speech at the UN that was it they won me over
I'll say that my most fav is the UN speech, i cried and smiling proudly everytime i see their photos or video—the news are everywhere, i feel like a proud mom watching my kids grow up their speech also.. so so so inspiring, i see some my country's gp praise them pic.twitter.com/Q2Z38rgJ84
Oh i forgot to tell my fav memory of 2018. There is so much happening last year (ಥ ͜ʖಥ) from albums, achievements, concerts, UN speech and even mixtape..
Then I saw their show, interviews,... The UN speech push me become an RM stan. As long as I engaged in the fandom I find that he fit me so much:)))) So I love him a lot. He has dimples like my two sons:))) So cute! Now I have one convert ticket for Thailand LYS tour.
@echeribas @BTS_twt my favorite bts moment is their speech at the UN! I think they broke the barrier of being just a boygroup, showing their true meaning and message to the world, inspiring millions of young people and even the older generations :')
UN speech @NimShorty @Amrina_022 @BTS_twt

My forty something mom has been an army for years & she kept showing me BTS videos since HYYH era, I always ignored her, I only said ehm OK, they're just some kids... boy was I wrong/dumb/close minded, I saw the light after their UN speech and I haven't looked back ever since
I was sorta an bts anti because I was an toxic army anti, but it took me a while since DNA to become a fan until 09.25.18, a day after their UN speech (I think).
getting mad at bts'speech in the UN, getting mad at bts being invited at the grammy museum. getting mad at bts raising over $1.4M for a campaing tht helps women & children but when exo gets played at a fountain water funded by their fans it's revolution and representation matters
Can I turn back time and tell this 19-year old boy that he's gonna deliver a UN speech one day? And also be the greatest leader to lead the biggest boy band in the world. AHH sweetie, the places you'll go & the heights you'll reach! #Namjoon #RM @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/341932877698711554 …
Namjoon was the first one to remind me that crying is ok. The first time I saw his speech (MAMA), I cried. I haven’t cried for a loooonnng time.. it felt weird but it’s nice to feel I’m human again. I always cried watching his UN speech btw. LOL! @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/knjloops/status/1083265893147258881 …
I LOVE U SO MUCH NAMJOON U KNOW, YOU ARE THE BEST LEADER EVER. U SPEECH AT UN AND YOUR NEW MIXTAPE GOT #1 ITUNES MORE THAN 90 COUNTRY @BTS_twt
they became popular, they became known, they're known worldwide, they broke records after records after records, they gave a speech at un, their album design got nominated at grammys, they became top social artists, they received more than 100 awards in just a year, they're bts. https://twitter.com/BTS_tit/status/314446777589825536 …
BTS goes to the BBMA's and y'all call it irrelevant, they chart on Hot100 and y'all call them westernized and overhyped. They perform at the AMAs and y'all hype the racist comments they got, they give a speech at the UN and y'all clown Joon's words calling him cheesy
yall mocked the FUCK out of bts’ tsa award, made fun of their grammy nom calling it useless and given out of pity, you made fun of joon’s un speech, you downgrade EVERY achievement they’ve had in the us and yet you have the fucking nerve to talk about respect?
“who is promoting hangul the most right now? bangtan sonyeondan. bts is the actualy vessel and promoters of hangul.” @dkdktv92 un speech he hit the important points! this is why i don’t understand how come some people still say that bangtan is irrelevant in south korea. pic.twitter.com/AA4ee2GX9c
yall allowed people to talk down on the un speech but want to talk abt asian representation wen that was probably one of the hardest things bts had to do in terms of being asian men.
not @loud mfs saying bts' UN speech wasn't revolutionary because it didn't cover all issues in the world and instead focused on giving voice to the youth, also mocked "speak yourself" bc it didn't make sense to them, but now yall care about rep? these fake wokes SMELL. pic.twitter.com/70sVFDw2wo
When bts got #1 on bb,kpopie were quite, when the won bb award they call it a paper award(the same paper award they are tagging their faves like crazy to get a nom), when bts spoke at un they mock joonie's speech, I could go on forever.pfft group of idiots eaten up by jealousy
BBMA, AMA, top 3 talk shows, speech at UN, 2 #1 BB200, multiple hot 100 entries, multiple RIAA certfications, Invitation to grammy museum, so much more and they just boiled it down to some mtv award to which BTS didn't even go to. This is so sad.
y'all said the TSA is just a paper award, y'all degrade bts inspirative UN speech saying it's only a promotion for their albums, y'all degrade LY: Tear package saying you can draw the flowers in 10 seconds, y'all degrade bts for owning daesangs saying it has lost it's credibility
mocking about bts social artist award at bbmas, mocking bts UN Speech, mocking bts for grammy nomination, mocking bts for owning 2018 daesang, mocking bts on hot100 but when another kpop group step one (1) foot on america it’s revolutionary and representation matters.
if they are going to talk about us getting mad can they at least remember when they got mad when bts got their 1st win, their 1st daesang, went to billboard, went to american music shows, when they were nominated to grammys, and when they did the speech at the un
yall literally even tried to drag namjoon’s un speech what yall talking about who fcking cares about ur faves bought performances, fountain thingy or other bs, it ain’t revolutionary hypocrites and everything ur faves might achieve in the west is thanks to bts in the 1st place
Kpoppies got pressed when bts won at BBMA’s.They were mad when bts performed at AMA’s.They were mad when tear got a Grammy nomination. They were mad when BTS got invited to make a speech at the UN. But when E*O played at a water fountain it was life changing and revolutionary
But honestly its so easy for y'all to talk shit like this but when bts went to the bbmas and amas and performed there, when bts performed at dick clark's show, when bts gave a whole ass speech at the UN you all don't care but y'alls fountain show rlly mattered huh
Kpoppies got pressed when bts won at BBMA’s.They were mad when bts performed at AMA’s.They were mad when tear got a Grammy nomination. They were mad when BTS got invited to make a speech at the UN. But when E*O played at a water fountain it was life changing and revolutionary
Not at how eggs got mad about the UN speech & couldn’t even make a point because they didn’t bother to look up what the entire point of the meeting was. Also got mad about bts starting a charity campaign because it’s not y’alls favs. Don’t start
namjoon: releases mixtape, delivers a speech in UN, leading bts to world domination, saving the whole music industry, produces songs on top of songs, prepares for the next comeback "im getting lazy these days" "i should work harder" EYE
2019 bts: yall are going to be billboard no. 1 and make a speech at the un headquarters 2013 bts: pic.twitter.com/JfTNwbhBzF
whenever they get recognized, or literally anything, making fun of the grammy nom, the UN speech. Its rare to see kpop stans actually respect bts. So thanks ig
someone on YouTube was upset that ppl are using BTS as a culture representation of Korea instead of the Korean language and called BTS music low quality by comparing them to McDonalds and this is what DKDKTV has to say. Thank you Danny for the UN speech https://youtu.be/yzROUqr_A0I
Disrespectful BTS fans are not ARMY. Rewatch the UN speech! Lisa respects every culture and tries her best. She deserves! #RespectLisa
GUYS what should i make my senior quote?? i want it to be said by bts, maybe even a quote from joons UN speech ?
when I first saw this I thought you guys gonna react to BTS debut stage too but it was totally different anyway thank you for the UN speech tho @dkdktv92 you better keep that “oopsie of the week” go and watch it guys the content is gooooooood https://youtu.be/yzROUqr_A0I pic.twitter.com/l2DGyXL15E
yes, they are a biased twt acct claiming to reveal truth when they all do is filter news. They didn’t even post the UN speech about BTS, when that’s a positive news . They all post bts related stuff is all negative. That’s how filtered they are.
Are you kidding me ?? @iHeartRadio you are unprofesio Al , do you don't know BTS @BTS_twt ,i Will introduce for you ( the best artist seller ini usa, Billboard 200 second time , un speech , time cover ,have gold and platinum in USA etc ) stupid you

BTS is low quality music. Someone on the Internet calls BTS low quality music - and David gives out a UN speech. @BTS_twt #bts #dkdktv https://youtu.be/yzROUqr_A0I via @YouTube
My Top 3 @BTS_twt Proudest Moments in 2018 are: 1. UN Speech 2. Receiving Cultural Merit Award 3. Ending Love Yourself Era with an important message everyone should slowly achieve during their journey in life. Proud is an understatement at this point.
BTS is like shitty fast food? David gets triggered (and gives a UN speech) in our latest OOPSIE OF THE WEEK. Watch it now - https://www.patreon.com/posts/23860001 pic.twitter.com/XhUw8jGr3C
UN speech and then the cultural merit award right after... pheww that was such a good timing.. @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt My bias is OT7 . My favorite moments are them winning awards and RM's UN speech I want #8 the most, I need good skin pic.twitter.com/DSUItm6YR6
I literally hate the fact that no one pays heed to bts' UN speech but they rather press on the fact that they won social media award.
bts episodes be like - UN speech - cultural merit medal
today, i did a persuasive speech about @BTS_twt in class (talked about em theories, jimin's promise, UN speech etc) and i'm so happy it went well!! pic.twitter.com/Wqv1DApFtS
I figured it out 170317 - the day I saw bts at 2017 KCON Mexico 170521 - 1st BBMAs 171119 - Their AMAs performance/ USA debut 180520 - 2nd BBMAs 180924 - UN speech 181006 - Their concert at CitiField (thx @starrynightgcf)https://twitter.com/disorder_8/status/1082916521645621248 …
Ok so 170317 - the day I saw bts at 2017 KCON Mexico 170521 - 1st BBMAs 171119 - Their AMAs performance/ USA debut 180520 - 2nd BBMAs 180924 - UN speech 181006 - ???
bts really went to a un meeting and gave a speech, I’m so freaking honored to stan
I just rewatched bts’ un speech and I’m in my feelings again
Whole Korea know BTS is the very first and yougest artist who won Order of Cutral Merits Medal in korea and made a speech in UN ! Sucess?? How dare you compare bts with who???? https://twitter.com/bts_my_smeraldo/status/1082896155552374785/photo/1pic.twitter.com/3pKJxWqRik pic.twitter.com/xMbb8ddzcd
Remember that scare we had when we thought BTS and trump were both going to be at the UN HQs at the same time, but he was there the day after BTS gave their speech, whew we dodged that bullet pic.twitter.com/oRyiTWEvLa
Jimin has said that even though they perform a lot, he still gets nervous before every show and as I was watching BTS’s intro to Not Today last year for sbs I noticed Namjoon shaking so that’s what made me think abt this we also know how nervous Namjoon was for his UN speech
I would just like to say that the context of this scene refers to philanthropic works of ARMY. It's the behind the scenes of the UN speech
Exactly!! He really does work so hard THE UN SPEECH!!!! That was one of the most beautiful speeches I've ever heard, the way Joon spoke so clearly and so professionally... That will always be a BTS moment I'll never forget
The fact Joon is able to translate for the boys so fast in interviews as well, it’s really incredible. He’s so poetic and has such a way with words also, I mean the wordplay he does in both languages. And how could I not mention his speech at the UN
Stan @BTS_twt Queen! Ps: This man is Kim Namjoon aka #RM leader and one of the great rapper of the group. Check him out. He gave a great speech at @UN and they are the ambassadors of @UNICEF #ENDviolence campaign + @_GenUnlimitedpic.twitter.com/23vqJp45wh

so they did hinted the next era during the un speech huh? pic.twitter.com/NK3rr6u4y3
you telling me their UN speech was a part of this!!!
The speech from citified concert was also one of my favorites and how can we forget about the UN speech , it’s hard to pick when everything this man speaks is so deep , effective , well thought off and comes from a genuine place in his heart . I love you Namjoon
thanks for your thoughts and hard work! The Speak Yourself part is literally the UN speech :)
maybe the hint is in rm speech in UN ???they always show that at the VCR whenever they perform at award shows..
@pvnkdaisies @_raplinemyg @BTS_twt my fav bts moment is when they gave a speech at the UN

If we get the UN speech as a skit on the new album——— @BTS_twt

WE STAN! Reminds me of when I had to take an audio class and used bts related news (un speech) and music samples for my projects lol
Not to be *that* fan who makes everything about my faves but I only recognized that world bank man bc of bts and the UN speech
that the TxT account literally just uploaded the phrase that Namjoon said at the UN speech "What's your story?" couldn't be done by luck for sure. So yeah that's all i got so far, there's definitely a million more clues but i am not a genius haha #BTS #TxT @BTS_twt #IDOL2X2
PLS I NEED HELP! I’m writing about @BTS_twt speech at the UN but I need a cover photo so please drop the best one from that day, idk which one to use! Thanks
BTS was busy in 1)awards function 2)collecting awards Daesang. 3)UN speech. 4)Releasing new album 5)Love yourself tour 6)Teach us (army) love yourself. 7)run BTS episode 8) bon voyage season 3 9) January new awards function coming they are busy 10) more ly tour ++++++
exactly like remember when they said that BTS should get a grammy nomination to really be considered as successful even after the 2 BB200s the hot 100 the UN speech and all the other things they accomplished in 2018
They hold - and they've always held - BTS and their fandom to a standard much higher than they hold any other group or fandom. To the point that they invalidate ANYTHING they do, from their heartfelt lyrics, to their MAMA speech to their UN Speech. The double standard is ugly af
i have to analyze a speech at school and ofc i chose bts’ un speech and im actually kinda excited to write it
I’m listening to Namjoon’s UN speech with Epiphany & I’m really going through it. Why aren’t we talking about it anymore? It’s so powerful & I have been crying because Joonie really hit the best points. Joonie if you ever see this, thank you @BTS_twt. https://soundcloud.com/ripley-cohen/namjoon-un-speech-x-epiphany-speak-yourself …

bts does dolls, movies, books, on car advertisements, cosmetics advertisements, global ambassador of puma, worldwide boyband, grammy nominee, billboard winner, daesang winners, did un speech, unicef campaign, cultural merit awardees,,, CAN PEOPLE EVEN RELATE LOL
My mind is stuck with SPEAK YOURSELF since Namjoon gavr speech at UN..it have to be Speak Yourself the new era @BTS_twt
It does make a lot of sense. According to the un speech, u need to discover, 'WHO ARE YOU?'
just passed by a billboard playing bts’ un speech
OKAY! do we notice how the circle never closes? could that be because self-love doesn’t have an endpoint and should be an accumulation of everything we are? Her, Wonder, Tear, Answer Namjoon’s UN speech BTS performing their tb songs our past still remains relevant to our future pic.twitter.com/h57mEYOR91
I mean if we didn't bts would not have 2 number 1 albums, 2 bb100 songs, pwrfomed at the amas and bbmas, having a speech at the UN ect
I guess South Career only cared about BTS/Namjoon having speech in the UN. They never really cared about THE SPEECH ITSELF. Smh #RespectLisapic.twitter.com/2uT9vUTiGK
@BTS_twt V-hy so serious bro? This is not un speech tho Rm love is a maze but damn u is amazing pic.twitter.com/FohhNN7Han
In China, one day of last year and 2019.1.1, BTS appeared on the CCTV13 (one channel of the biggest mainstream TV station). one newpaper published an article about bts. All of these I think is because the achievements they got, such as speech in the UN, and Time magazine, etc
So, it was an army who started the hate towards Lisa? Bro, like wtf? are you serious, you idols gave a speech at the UN about encouragement and loving yourself, and all you do is hate on someone because of the color of her skin, u are disgusting and BTS DOES NOT DESERVE U AS FAN.
@BTS_twt RM gave a really good speech in UN. But your words and actions do not match ! Why can't you love yourself with all your flaws which are not under your control. Do you really have to fit into the weird constraints that the society put in ??
I believe RM's speech at GDA today was a "sister" speech to his UN message, since the same theme of "naming" plays a significant role in both. Today's VCR also contained his key UN phrase "Speak Yourself". For that reason I'm reposting my analysis of his UN speech here. @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/msbeatrice_81/status/1044404970425122821 …
Re-reading RM's speech, I am strongly reminded of his UN message. This idea of "naming" being significant is found throughout both. I feel like this speech is a sister of his UN speech, where he asked us to, "Find your name, and find your voice, by speaking yourself." @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/JK_Glitters/status/1081871134516281344 …
I start to stan them bcs Jin kiss the statue, My ex roommate stan them bcs of their UN speech, My bestie stan them bcs she heard JK moaning, My friends stan them bcs bts are crackheads So yeah, it's easy.
Hopefully more ARMY stop being ashamed of our name. I used to feel awkward when people asked what ARMY is/mean But after @BTS_twt (RM) speech at the UN, I learned to embrace it. I am a proud Adorable Representative MC for Youth
Yeah they r thesame ppl who gave meaningful and inspiring speech in UN. @BTS_twt Don't ask me any questions just embrace the moment. The dorkable group I love and stan https://twitter.com/bangstan7/status/1081874646025162753/video/1 …

This clip had me so emotional! It featured their Love Yourself Tour, the BBMAs, Jimmy Kimmel, their UN speech and their NO and FIRE eras... They've come so far... I'm forever proud of them... ~ L @BTS_twt #BTSatGDA #BTS #GDA2019pic.twitter.com/E6ulIrGjQd
I thought we already collectively knew that speak yourself was connected to the next era since the UN speech oof @BTS_twt
Yeah i know & btw its hope world by jhope But i told that whole account is fake just someone created idk who want to play with us BTS is enough So we'll wait and see but what absolutely kinda sure of it that un speech have something with comeback as speack yourself so we'll see
bold of bts to assume im not going to cry at the vcr when there's a whole UN speech flashed right before my eyes

There is a group of people sitting next to me at this restaurant and they’re talking about bts, but more specifically about joon and praising his speech at the un, and how he learned English from watching friends- I’m :(((
@nataliagermanou thank you for praising bts and mentioning their UN speech and their appearance on TIME magazine!! this shows you are professional and take your work seriously. armys are grateful!!
I just watched namjoon's UN speech again and I'm feeling so inspired. @BTS_twt thank you
BTS released 71songs in 2018 only, the tour dates, the promotion inside and outside Korea, the UN speech, still the tour continue in 2019 and they already work on their next album recorded some songs. And you have the nerve to say your faves work harder than bts??
In their about section you see a quote of RM’s speech at the UN; “What’s your story? Speak yourself” The channel exists since 26. October 2017 Link to the video: https://youtu.be/cLiqIN937Bk @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/1O2BZkvqpU
I did a small part of one essay on bts and army and then I also did a WHOLE essay on Namjoon's UN speech... I'm yet to find more essays I can relate to my 7 favourite men
@Nithi_sai @BTS_twt my fav moment is when they gave speech in UN..I waa awestruck
Me ha gustado un vídeo de @YouTube (http://youtu.be/SS_Brvci5X8?a - My Dad reacts to BTS "Artist Of The Year" Speech - MAMA Awards 2018
GDA better give BTS a VCR of all their achievements. Include bb achievements, tv show appearance, UN speech, RIAA certifications, box office success and their solo achievements. I’m looking at you hopeworld, Mono’s 90 iTunes no. 1s and Jimin’s soundcloud breaking record.
bts: worldwide icons, most awarded korean artists, delivered a speech at the UN, considered as the world’s next generation leaders but still get shy when their commercials are being played at the golden disc awards
And oh, please watch BTS' speech at the UN Assembly in New York and find out what you're looking for. Let's see if you're still going to be racist and insensitive towards them. Bet you will cry if you watch it, dear.
@nataliagermanou i heard you defend bts and show them who they are (Time,and UN SPeech) thank you for educating those people who said mean things towards this 7 guys who change the history of both korean and American Music History. You have my respect
just listened to the UN speech again and got reminded lars løkke met bts before i did pic.twitter.com/k9IuD4V4So
True, when they called me childish and why like bunch of man wearing make up, I just shoved BTS UN speech and all awards they win on that person face
i was with a guy for a short time & he really respected BTS as an Artist, he liked Joonies UN speech, enjoyed crack videos and could‘t understand why other guys would bash them. He even put my Hobi pc in his phonecase. Sadly i didn‘t catch feelings for him but we‘re friends
Look at the details of what they’re selling - photos, clips from YouTube, the un speech, etc. - basically they’re making money by using bts’ content, money that should be going to BigHit. It’s their intellectual property
Disgusting @opentvgr .Atleast they contributed and save lives in this world . You should watch BTS speech in UN to educate yourself.
#BTS Thank you #Billboard #BTS has been a positive influence around the world. The message of Loving Yourself to the world has no language barriers. The UN speech of Speak Yourself along with UNICEF has also left a positive impact. Setting records and high achievements @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/dsqTxmz81R
I am so happy that you mentioned the UN Speech. Thank you for joining in this happy community
Great article. I enjoy the way you write. And thanks for mentioning their UN speech
The DVD is basically bts mv's, bangtan bombs, other clips and the un speech
Translation of my tweet: Let's go back and remember the words of Kim Namjoon so people who don't know BTS can have a small taste of the message they are promoting to their fans. Speech in the UN. #greecerespectskpop #eutixeite
@BTS_twt Is either a Run crack vid or un speech. There is no in between
they’re suing this company that’s selling unauthorized bts content like the un speech
THE BTCHES THAT WERE TRYING TO SELL BTS’ UN SPEECH ARE BEING SUED LMAOJJBGHZJ
oh so apparently they’ve been selling bts’s un speech on dvd without permission and bighit is taking legal action
@bts_bighit @BigHitEnt we do not want the un speech to be included in such stuff because it was NOT made for profit, also we do not want any of this stuff if it's not approved by @BigHitEnt
Thanks for sharing your experience with ARMY, and what stemmed from an anthropomorphic heart with legs Mostly, thank you for taking the time to look up our suggestions to you, from the UN speech to the music. For giving BTS a chance. That’s all we could ever ask for. pic.twitter.com/VLwC2QI2rQ
Unfortunately I don't speak Greek, is there someone to translate this? And Miss Kenourgiou, it's really sad and shocking that in this time there are still people who think like you and your colleagues. Listen to BTS and read their lyrics or their UN speech. Open your mind pls.
I think armys proved their power with the sold out tour, and the 2 #1 albums. @BTS_twt showed the gp that they are different with their UN speech. A lot of armys including me believed back then that this would be the turning point for their separation from Kpop industry
But really we claim Kim Namjoon (RM, leader of @BTS_twt) as our President. I genuinely believe he will be Secretary General of the UN in his lifetime. Have you seen his speech at the UN? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
i made my friend listen to mono and they actually loved it, & now they’re asking me to recommend some bts songs/vids, & some lyrics to read as well! they seem to care more about the lyrics and what bts have to say though so i’m planning to make them watch joon’s UN speech first

My fav @BTS_twt moment is when they gave the speech in UN last year!! The most honourable nd proud for all ARMYs
Seeing how you pinned Joon’s UN speech on your profile this sure as hell contradicts it but are we surprised? Troll will always be a troll while bts and blackpink keep on collecting them coins
@DanReynolds look at @BTS_twt @BigHitEnt and RMs speech at the UN. You spread the same message of #LoveYourself #SpeakYourself @UNICEF #LGBTQ COLLAB? #BTSxImagineDragons Keep going, I purple you!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
100% agree with you!! That’s really is wonderful they’re both such big fans And they both have impeccable taste in biases (you can’t go wrong with any member) Aw, that’s really sweet that your grandfather liked Namjoon’s UN speech so much!!
Yes it really does!! It’s amazing how much diversity is in the ARMY fandom and I love it!!! They both love BTS! My grand dads bias is Namjoon (He liked him at first but I’m pretty sure his UN speech is what hooked him) and my nephew loooooves Hobi
A lot of people don't realize BTS is a safe heaven for a lot of us. I personally still listen to Namjoon's UN speech for self healing. That speech still leaves my heart feeling like its has fallen in love with itself after a horrible heartbreak. It uplifts me.
Does their time give birth to time? How is @BTS_twt doing a sold out world tour, promoting their current album/era in S.Korea and internationally, giving speech in the UN, attending AND performing differently for award shows in S.Korea and internationally... AND done recording? https://twitter.com/Aeonian_V/status/1080956009890238465 …

last time, BTS dropped a hint in their first BBMA speech for the LY era, what if they dropped a hint in their UN speech this time? let's discuss #BTSISCOMINGpic.twitter.com/zPpJvmqXqQ
you ever get so fucking emotional over BTS like FUCK??? joonie's UN speech, jimin's promise, the whole song that is epiphany, just HHHHHH
Gostei de um vídeo do @YouTube http://youtu.be/XCC06kSrkfA?a BTS RM SPEECH AT THE UN! REACTION
Omg so true the UN speech has really shown the gp that BTS are more than a typical boyband
BTS RM SPEECH AT THE UN! REACTION: http://youtu.be/XCC06kSrkfA?a via @YouTube
Bts helped me by showing that no matter what you look like or your hardships, you can learn to love yourself. Their UN speech especially struck a cord with me. It made me realise that they are normal people and if they can love themselves, so can I. - Ana, Uk
BTS has helped me love myself by giving their messages across the world. Their songs are so powerful and have so much meaning. What really helped me love myself was the their UN Speech! So amazing!! Thank you BTS! Nicole Ennis United States
Like y’all did with the billboard award? And Grammy nom? And UN speech? And the r*ghtwing Japanese propaganda used against bts for their political agenda??? Hmmm okay. pic.twitter.com/LvObtGqX9u
so you know how we got the BBMA speech as a track in LY: Her can we pls get a track of the entire UN speech in the next album @BTS_twt asking for a friend
Fact: I still get goosebumps when I see @BTS_twt's UN speech.
Bts really gave a speech at the UN I still can't believe such an event happened. They truly are our generation leaders and I'm glad they're being recognised for it. The influence and the power they have I'm so happy they were the chosen ones. They nailed it with the speech.
after my mum saw the un speech, anytime she hears bts, she always asks abt joon. my mother is an intellectual n mayhaps she has a bias
my english teacher trying to make class more interesting by randomly including bts in her speech? HAHAHA and she talked abt the un speech too
I MEAN IS HE THE ONE WHO PERFROMS DDAENG? THE ONE WHO PERFORMS CYPHER PT. 4? THE ONE WHO MADE SPEECH ON THE UN? IS HE THE LEADER OF BTS? pic.twitter.com/h0BgfwoFV8
Its 2019 and I'm still listening to @BTS_twt #RM UN speech. One of the most beautiful speech ever! tbh. Listen to BTS SPEECH at UNICEF Youth 2030 The UN Youth Strategy.mp3 by hanifa rahmi #np on #SoundCloudhttps://soundcloud.com/hanifa-rahmi/bts-speech-at-unicef-youth …
I was watching a video edited w BTS’ UN speech in it and I started crying, nothing new
I 100000% agree!! Scrolling through your account makes me wonder where American politics is heading... Everyone should really watch this inspiring UN speech by the leader of BTS Kim Namjoon https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
You're not alone! Welcome to the Fam Welcome to #BTSARMY We #support We #stan We are the best #Fans in the world ( #RM told that at @UN's speech) Welcome to @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/3XDHGdc6iY
Welcome Since you're interested in politics, here's a thread that talks about some of their political/social commentary through their music & actions - it's from earlier last year so things like their UN Speech (happened later) aren't included either. https://twitter.com/protectingRM/status/1005605183399911426?s=19 …
I love bluegrass and know a tiny bit of Irish rock lol. BTS does have rock elements in their discography—Fake Love, War of Hormone, Danger, Epiphany, etc. Am I Wrong has blues and political commentary. Anyways, I hope you watch the UN speech.
and when they deactivate you feel so happy and satisfied even after they acknowledge that they are wrong.. do you think thats a right thing? aren't you even an army? you proudly say that you watch bts' speech at the UN but none of them you take it seriously by heart.
I saw Namjoon speech at UN in my tl on another account so I decided to find out about BTS, then I started to listening to their songs.. then here I am https://twitter.com/goldenjungkie/status/1080439887872942081 …
I'll take this as an compliment that their country acknowladge and cherish bts for helping south kor increase their economy income this year and bringing exposure to kpop wave and south korea by being the first kpop group to go on bbma, ama, and having UN speech
@jpurplesbts @BTS_twt @btsfilmfic when they had their UN speech
I love BTS becuz they hear about our issues and sing about it. They always talk about current events. Rm and wale rapped about police brutality, racism, how the world has to change. Rm in his Un Speech talked about how to speak ourselves regardless of gender identity.
Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/1O1rryNeX5M?a BTS (방탄소년단) SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy”
My fave BTS moment is 100% them going to the UN general assembly and giving the speech. It was so moving and beautifully inspiring, overall a huge step for them. @BTS_twt @jhsiconic @oceanicmemories
Ahhhhh so manyyyyy. Their UN Speech, them winning Daesang, Promise, their Grammy nomination.....etc. I honestly can't choose. @Dani_N_Ash @DaniInThisIsh @Nguyenhel0000
Story time: So my mum watched the gayo daejejeon with me on New Year’s Eve. She kept asking me who was the oldest and how old he was, Cos she only recognised RM from the UN speech. I pointed out Jin during the performance and she said he’s the most handsome. #Jin #진 @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/r1I3KU0izU
@shookykkookie @shookykoyya @Btslockscreens4 @inourseouls My fav bts moment has to be the un speech pic.twitter.com/M3dDcAcexg
So I’ve been reconnecting with friends this past couple weeks, all muggles from Spain. And 3 of them knew about @BTS_twt for different reasons: Knew about #BTS collaborating with @steveaoki Saw their @UN speech and wanted to know more Saw IG posts from a #BTSARMY friend
I listened to president joon’s UN speech
made my bestfriend watch the UN speech n we talked about how i truly hope bts will be taken seriously more and more n she started ranting about xenophobia & how stupid people that limit themselves bc of cultural differences and language barriers are. Her mind pic.twitter.com/H5jRIjXV4Q

Nice speech good for them
Honestly @BTS_twt has had so many memorable moments that’s it’s hard to just pick one. For me the one that stands up more is the UN Speech. It was something that gave them global recognition not just with the music industry but with world leaders. Very proud #BTSMomentof2018pic.twitter.com/h8wwdRMxZd
《• Sept •》 BTS kept on making 2018 amazing by making me feel EXTREMELY proud of them. They are proud UN ambassadors and have donated millions to their campaigns for youth all around the world, Joon gave an inspiring speech in front of world leaders and made us proud pic.twitter.com/NuGuJf3wnI

#BTSMomentof2018 It was when I heard their speech at MAMA, telling us they were close to disbanding but stayed, that was the moment I knew I had stanned the right group. Also the UN speech. It made me proud. I'm glad I found them. Thank u @BTS_twt for everything u showed me
Every moment with bts is a cherished moment. One of the many things thats memorable is the UN speech of our president Namjoon. Love all of them so much @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/f7o6LvCuXr

A lot of people do care because they have CHANGED and SAVED many lives esp. the youth. That's why the SoKor govt is proud of them. Listen to RM's speech in the UN perhaps you'll UNDERSTAND. P.S.

Program info. [War of Words] War of the vicious tongues. this is JTBC's main talk show deals with various hot issues in Korea. Today's theme was aboutba famous scene for 2018. One of guest, Rep. Lee chul-hee (politician), recommended BTS's speech at the UN General Assembly.
Bts have also expanded that conversation outside of their music, namely when they gave a speech at the UN this year. They are seen as Global Ambassadors of love and peace by many people. Your tweet does not do you any favors, and I suggest you delete. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y …
Then show his speech in UN .... and say isnt he amazing

I can’t hear you over the 71 songs BTS produced this year, their Grammy nomination, multiple #1 songs on the charts, order of cultural merits, their paks, daesangs, Namjoons speech at the UN, billboard awards, and their sold out world tour including an arena concert in America
"No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself." (Namjoon's UN speech)
There are some many but I picked two of the many (random pick of my pics ) The UN speech was huge and I loved it that they spoke about sensitive subject and so caring. Malta was kinda down time and just then being together(well almost) was great. Every moment with BTS is amazing pic.twitter.com/5BPC3wNaIY
Hi Rm,you are so great and a good example to make me to learn ,thanks to the Lords,let me see your speech in UN news on TV, I am so happy to listen and see the your moved my heart! Thanks to the Lord!Amen! Dina From Taiwan (2018/12/29) pic.twitter.com/gsKhE5Sr1V

BTS won 13 Daesang,over 100 awards,got platinum & gold RIAA & RIAJ,over 5M albums sales & two #1 album, 5B views,2B Spotify streams,Top10 on BB performed at BBMAs & biggest us TV shows, gave a speech at the UN got Cultural Merit Medal in 2018 only,they have outsold y'all faves
I'm watching Bangtan Bomb of BTS when they have a speech in UN while waiting their performance in KBS.
Not only that, they don't even assert their power on tv shows. If it was any other kpop group achieving all things BTS did this year (#1 on BB,UN speech, RIAA cert. etc) they would perform last,no questions asked. But BH doesn't even care for that, the boys still the show always.
PREACH, I am in the same position, bts was out of the norm for me too. I have never bothered with any type of artist or music, but when I saw RMs UN speech I started looking them up and fell in love with their message.
the only reason bts works here is because they have a genuine message backed up by genuine talent and even then it took almost two years of promo here, a sold out tour, and a UN speech to mark a distinct shift in gp sentiment
Yas !!! Kim Namjoon had the best speech ever and inspired all children and adults all over the world, I'm so proud on him KIM NAMJOON you are the best THANK YOU #croatianeedsbts #btscroatia #BTS #KIMNAMJOON #balkanneedsbts #남준
Althought it may seem like SK gp isn't familiar with BTS music, I think their achievements are definitely getting more ppl to listen. My mom who has never listened to any k idol music her entire life, now catches every performance ever since Joonie's UN speech. Her friends +
RM is actually the reason I got into BTS. Because of his UN speech, I became interested in finding out how his mind works. A lot of artists are inspiring and influential but RM is different. His thoughts, his passion and how he expresses them- https://twitter.com/KayePopBangtan/status/1077947081036361728 …
still can't believe bts did a speech in the UN on my birthday
Yes, that is @BTS_twt's speech at the UN for @_GenUnlimited leading @ChannelNewsAsia's round-up of pop culture moments that shook up 2018. https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/trending/top-pop-culture-moments-that-shook-us-in-2018-11065632 …pic.twitter.com/cg4QCRC7w9
Listen to BTS’s speech at the UN again and learn...”No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself. “ and I & others are now speaking for ourselves some of this has been going on for too long. Smh
Every moment with #BTS UN Speech, Time Magazine, LY World Tour, Billboard ALL of them! mostly how they give back the love to #Army @BTS_twt
Every second is my favourite bts moment. They make us proud countless time. But if I have to choos it probably UN Speech. My eyes watering everytime I heard Namjoon's speech. How they used to dream for their voice to be heard, and finally they made it to the UN, fucki*g UN
jus made my sister listen to ddaeng aNd bts un speech pic.twitter.com/U3XbmRxzNX
True! I’m new army (just “joined” in Sept when I got curious abt them after the UN speech) and now I am gorging on their dance practices, RUN BTS, BV, etc. Next stop: LY Concert in HK!
2nd with their personalities, that they show during RUN BTS and more. 3rd Namjoon speech during the UN was so DAMN powerful that even my niece (8 years) started to think about that, she asked questions, she was interest in their message https://twitter.com/__Samira7__/status/1044270469703241728 …
I just recently showed my 61 yr old ex-coworker friend a couple of BTS and MX mvs, and she watched Namjoon's entire UN speech. I don't know if she's a convert, but she's watched a few more mvs on her own. She's in love with Shownu "but WITHOUT MAKEUP"!!!
Exactly the point, both groups have achieved something this year but you don’t to put the other group or member down because they didn’t get a Grammy nom or presented a speech at the UN. Those don’t matter to Got7, a wax figure shouldn’t matter to bts.
My fav part of the speech c:
The speech at the UN was wonderful. Thankful that BTS is involved with this cause.
the un speech and bts winning AOTY at mama
I am so proud that i stan these incredible seven humans who share their positive message through their music, speech and action!!! "You shown me I have reason, I should love myself"!! I purple you
It's a hot topic after they gave UN speech. Impactful.
Not only BTS is on the list of issues that left a big impression, but also UN Speech, Billboard No. 1, and Love Yourself are in it. https://twitter.com/BangtanSeaDayak/status/1078216826159489025 …
BTS unite US Ps : have u seen RM and bts had speech in @UN ? You should watch! pic.twitter.com/m9ZtTAYvEy
Same here... my husband only knew about bts....bts only.. he even watched their UN speech..proud wife here
my brother saw like 30 seconds of bts’ UN speech and he likes them now and what they stand for
sometimes i go back to joon's un speech and then feeling sad bc some people still don't take everything joon and a whole bts said from heart seriously
BTS had their best year yet. Over 5M albums sold, sold out world tour with multiple stadiums, UN speech, multiple awards won in and outside of Korea, performed on talk shows and award shows, and best yet a Grammy nomination
[ENG] SBS NEWS chose @BTS_twt's speech at the UN as one of the most touching moments for the Koreans in the year 2018, which made them cry and laugh.
Joon’s UN Speech
usa my. best memory of 2018 is when namjoon read his speech at the UN conference
my original acc got taken down cause technical difficulties so heRe I aM!!! *agressive uwu rt and follow if u are a fan of any of the ff, lets be friends (pLS) -bts -bnha -hq/haikyuu -taehyung's ass -bakugou's biceps -jungkook's gcfs -rm's speech at the un -kaachan -izuku
i cant believe my 2nd bts concert was the night before their iconic UN speech i was living pre-speak yourself era
#BTSLoveMyself This year was amazing. I lived it happily. Got to know #BTS & enjoy their music, watched then crossover to America with a trembling heart but focused on us, won our hearts & made us proud at the UN with a speech for the ages. I’m happy!
!!!! @BuzzFeed used @BTS_twt their speech at the UN in their list of 45 important things from around the world! pic.twitter.com/8nlx7LRu9p
Bts UN speech, namjoon’s speech was very inspiring and important. We have to speak ourselves and know who we are...
For me, it's the inspiration and motivation to do better starting with yourself. Namjoon's UN speech and the entire LY series were the key factors to that. I can't thank @BTS_twt enough for doing what they do.
My happiest Moment with bts was the UN speech because it was the Moment i realized they understand me and stand behind me no matter what even tho they dont even know i exist they help me so much
My happiest moment with BTS was when I saw videos of them when they went to UN and I listened Joon's speech. That's when I understood what I want to do in life. They really are my inspiration in life. pic.twitter.com/VTiYVGfYzy
I’m so sorry but I’ve been laughing for 10 minutes now at BTS’ duality, the boys who were pulling animal hats with squeaky sound effects are the same people who delivered an incredible and formal speech at the UN, I love their duality pic.twitter.com/bKOgUdX7EQ
His speech at UN. It moved and inspired me a million times till today. And that was how I finally introduced BTS to my mother.
There's too many beautiful BTS memories but my top few are when tear got Grammy nominated, when BTS opened up to us during mama hongkong and when we all formed a cult for jins birthday also the UN speech I wish them great success, happiness and good health for the coming year.
@BTS_twt at UN giving significant speech, it just shows they arent just an idol and artist, theyre like humans that are so inspirational to us
me sneaking bts UN speech into my essay about celebrity endorsement as if im really doing something
Like they know about UN speech but they didn't listen to it. Is it so hard to read korean subtitles? We are whatching korean content everyday thou? So we know that reading subtitles isn't THAT hard.
And I seek to develop a peaceful relationship with myself, and finally embrace myself. Thank you @BTS_twt for everything you do. It’s just like the contrast between “Reflection” saying “I wish I could love myself” and RM’s UN speech saying “I have come to love myself”
What about that 1 billion stream on spotify? Grammy nomination? Un speech? Being the first kpop band to ever sell out citi field in 10 min? Being the worldwide phenomenas and paving the way more like lifting the standards of kpop. Bts>exo #facts
US The UN speech
the reason they constantly use him is bc some ppl care too much abt what antis say. i've seen in some other parts of twt there are antis calling bts members ugly, talentless, even come for joon's un speech but we don't blow those up daily bc who cares?? they're antis for a reason
#RM Hands were Trembling at UN speech.But he Gave Best Speech.its being used for Education purpose thats big achievment. RM; inspiration to overcome Nervousness.Thats D leader i love Also Thank U RM for intro:Singularity its always stuck on my mind #ReflectionRKive @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NgxthlsZ6Z
Usa and my best memory would be the bts UN speech
omg bts filmed run episodes in canada when in a couple of days namjoon had to do their un speech
#BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt Thank you for your words of encouragement!! I’ve always been over weight and after hearing the speech at the UN and hearing Love-yourself I decidedi was going to do just that! I’ve lost 50 pounds so far and I’m still going strong!!
It might be his UN speech to me, this UN speech show me how big BTS impact to this world, and it show me hope, that if i work my best and puting all my effort and love into my work something great will happened Joon work with all his love, thats how he give love to the world
I’ve learnt to face myself and to embrace who I truly am. Namjoon’s UN speech really helped me realize this. I’m not just “me” now, I also am who I was yesterday and who I aspire to be tomorrow. I’ve learnt to embrace change and to love myself with all my faults and flaws
It’s a tie between the UN speech, Magic Shop, and Mono. The UN, speech was beautiful. Magic Shop, the lyrics are very therapeutic and calming to me. And Mono was so well written, and to me shows his growth as an artist. He has had an amazing year! #ReflectionRKive #RM
I thought I'd give a gift for the holidays so here it is BTS as quotes from the UN Speech @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/vdroh4ep6h
It was mono which made me feel so connected to his thoughts, myself and the whole world. At first listen it made me cry. Then I became soft for the people around me for we all share such experiences. Same with his UN speech. I was so impressed #ReflectionRKive #RM @BTS_twt
The UN speech as well as Mono spoke directly to my heart I have so much respect for this man and I know I can learn a lot from Namjoon #ReflectionRKive
I was most proud of Joon not only when Tear, the album where he worked on all the songs, but also Answer both went #1 on BB. And of course the UN speech moved even locals as intended, and don't forget the magificent mono! #ReflectionRKive #RM @BTS_twt
His UN speech. But Trivia Love and Mono mean a lot to me too.
Ive recently met up with my irl bff who have zero knowledge about BTS, but then she knows that I love them so much & that she saw Namjoon's UN speech & she said, "I didn't know they speak like that, they seem different than others." And I've never felt more proud as an ARMY
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
Listening here from Denmark you you @BTS_twt Thanks for blessing us with so many highlights in 2018 that I cannot count them all... The love yourself series Burn the stage + the movie The world tour The UN speech All the broken records 메리 크리스마스

BTS appeared on LBCI during a segment talking about UNICEF’s achievements video throughout the year which included RM’s speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/lIXrjL8fyV
The people I know, some of them make really nice comment when they found out I'm ARMY. they said the boys give good influence to the society, help teens. they read news abt how BTS musics help us. And not to forget, they also mention RM speech of the UN. I could say, Its very+
I love every moment with them but my fave must be Namjoons UN speech, cuz for the first time my friends and family didn’t just see them as a kpop group but they understood how much bts impacted me to do good things
i never said i'd fight hate with hate, so... namjoon said in his un speech to respect people's gender identity so if ur gonna bring bts into this please remember that too! also i'd rather defend the person who was hurt than the person who hurt them and refused to apologise
Their digital n physical sales are through the roof. Their concert being sold out. They joined forces with unicef w #endviolence campaign. BTS RM even gave a speech in UN headquaters. Their fans are so diverse. pic.twitter.com/QDegcKsjJu
B*tch you think I care about YT views, call me when bp surpass bts on Spotify streams, #1's on iTunes, billboard charts, RIAA certifications, daesangs, when they give a speech at the UN, and don't get too confident about your views bc next cb we might be doubling that number.
I can’t believe it’s been almost three months since BTS gave their speech at the UN already... it feels like just yesterday :( https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
#TDYTopSocialArtist @BTS_twt #BTS had a phenomenal year, 2 #1 BB Albums, Love Yourself: Answer went RIAA Gold (1 of 33 for 2018), MDR Platinum, IDOL Gold, UN speech, Cultural Merit...opening so many s & s to amazing music! So glad got to see them live...best of All! pic.twitter.com/Kuoq8zrg2x
still cant rly get over the fact that bts delivered their un speech On My Birthday and made me spend an entire half of my day crying over them
My most memorable moment this year was … when BTS dropped hope world,mono and LY tear also their MMA performance and their un speech #HappyNewYear #2018Memorypic.twitter.com/swOaVp5vle
My fav bts moment is when they get to give a speech at the UN
if you wanna convert them or make them accept that they're here to stay and shouldn't be seen as an aggression but a good influence, maybe make them watch UN speech if u wanna help ur friends deal ofc. if u like watching them suffer bc bts is everywhere is good too
this speech give inspiration bcoz of BTS i handle myself from depression, sadness now i can love myself , no matter how i look i can explain myself , i can do everything
It's incredible how every time I listen to this speech I start to cry.
++ 05/21/17: 1st BBMAs 05/27/18: 1st #1 on BB 200 11/19/17: 1st bts performance on a major U.S. award show 09/24/18: UN speech save these dates ARMYs! @BTS_twt
Is it time to empower the youth to be a part of decision making.. I have seen my self for youth to be given a voice. But voice with empowering them is useless. It like just giving a speech and there is no backing to the words behind it.
Moving speech - #Brave #Respect
Such an amazing speech delivered by our dear leader RM BTS are amazing not only as an artist but also in person..As the year progresses, I wish that your success keeps on soaring high..We love you and will always support you @BTS_twt
Wow his speech was soo encouraging to young people like us.... We purple you BTS
Even though i watched this hundred times before i still can't get over this powerful speech I'm so thankful to be an #ARMY Thank you so much #KimNamjoon for this amazing beautiful speech I LOVE YOU SO MUCH @BTS_twt #ARMY #BTS FIGHTING
Hope World drop, Namjoon ment at citifield, UN speech, Grammy interview, mono dropping out of nowhere, btsxaoki billboard hunt and all english song drop, JK hurting his ankle and learning from it, Time Mag, Cultural Merit by Korea, MMA performance, MAMA speech...
I love this speech @BTS_twt
This is the most remarkable #speech made by an "ordinary 24 years old boy" to the #World, Every time I hear it, the joy of knowing @BTS_twt makes my heart realize that becoming #BTS fan, it has been on of the best things happened to me ever, yes! #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear
A strong & full of conviction's speech of RM that speak everyone's struggle of SELF-LOVE... Now, I am starting to ask myself " What is my name and who I am beyond that" and I am surprised to find it hard to define me.
These speech from Namjoon will remain one of the most powerful speech I've ever heard in my life,the topic is simple "in some people's mind" but almost no one has ever brought it to words nd spoke about it seriously nd I think no one could make it as beautifully said as he did
un speech. I sobbed my eyes out I was so proud. #クリスマスボックス⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠ #ENDViolence #BTSLoveMyself
Excellent speech
What a wonderful speech. He is definitely more mature than his age. I am almost 69 and I don't know if I could have been that eloquent. Keep going on the right track BTS!!!
I still cry everytime i hear this speech like it was the first time. They taught us how to love ourselves. They inspired us in so many ways. I am so thankful to be an ARMY and stan the most amazing group of the world pic.twitter.com/XZf9w4Qsa9
Speech made me cry ten times over. Will never be over it :((
Indeed, an original and inspirational speech #クリスマスボックス
Thank you for highlighting this speech! That day was a magical one. I’m so glad I decided to tune in, since I not only got to hear RM’s legendary speech, but also the words of so many other inspirational people. I got all fired up!
Their look during the UN speech. They looked like world leaders. This year Tae had many different hair colors, but his natural hair color looked the best.
What a powerful and amazing speech
@BTS_twt talked about society, school and government control of kids, the words from "Intro: O!RUL8,2?" were also in RM's #UN speech, which again was presented in #2018MAMA stage with #LoveYourself remix. #Lovemyself #UNICEF #ARMY #btstheories #BTSTheorypic.twitter.com/qyx31a4G5c

This speech makes me speechless..
He's so well spoken and the speech was so inspiring im about to cry
that was such a inspiring, Emotional, and beautiful speech from BTS in general and our leader KIM NAMJOON also known as RM THAT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DAYS OF THIS YEAR I PURPLE U BTS
legends, the best speech ever pic.twitter.com/ncWUhy7EsI
Its a blessing for you #RM of having that inspiring and meaningful story. Story which gives a greatest lessons for those person who can't stand and show by their selves. Being a smart guy. It has a purpose and it was your message, which is considered as a presedantial speech. @BTS
An inspiring message that wakes up ourselves in the reality. Thanks for having that speech, which touches the heart of millions of people in this world. And now we realized that we need to stan out ourselves by the use of our voice and by loving first yourself. #RM message@UNICEF
I cry every single time. Such a well-spoken, moving and inspirational speech We are so lucky to have Namjoom as a leader
thank you for inspiring us .. that speech is a wake up call to those people who do not believe to their selves .. thank you BTS .. WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH
His speech speaks million dollar words Still one of my favourite. @BTS_twt
Wow I was just blown away RM you did a great speech
Great speech

UN speech. Namjoon's speech really. His words really touch everyone heart incl mine. How he such a young age can deliver such a beautiful mesaage? He encouraged us to be more open, to be who we are. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/5yZiQXZP9a
Thank you so much for giving them a chance. Hope you like their music. Even if you don't it's completely ok. Thanks for being polite and open-minded can I suggest you to watch their speech at the UN? It's really inspiring hope you check it out :) https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
it was only a team of 5 + the prof so only 5 ppl got to listen to it but i also showed IDOL mv with the lyrics and one of their interviews and talked about their speech at the UN, and they all thought they make great and beautiful lyrics
I'm not a student, but if he wants to see diversity, I can tell him that I'm 54 yrs old, and there are MILLIONS of ARMYs, both men and women, who are anywhere from 30 to 60+!! Hey, Dad, you should research BTS. They recently gave a speech at the UN for their work with Unicef!
I'm watching Joon's old logs and thinking about BTS' year + his speech in the UN . He already had that much depth at such a young age and even more so now.I guess ''Spring Day'' was from this thoughts of his https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=119&v=Qv9cdbhe308 …pic.twitter.com/KtoR9RfDxy
I agree. And to think it's rare to see kpop idols apologizing to certain issues, here's the leader of bts, criticized even until today for the past mistakes he did He addressed it in his UN speech around 3:43 pic.twitter.com/NJh2425PbV
Betrayed Korean group, BTS? gots such an impressive speech in UN that means too speak about human rights and peace in front of all of us in the world but they have two totally opposite faces! They love nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nazih in Germany! We are so upset still upset
Did Bacon say that EXO was gonna win all the awards last year with his WHOLE chest?? You talking about humility when bts achieved #1 albums, UN speech, cultural merit, platinum records and sold out stadiums and still cried tears of joy over daesangs they have won before??
BTS making speech at the UN, while their idol make faces and mouths in fashion magazines, for the love of God
Since Daesangs & western validation are not important-how about the Korean government gifting the Moroccan ministry w BTS albums, UN speech, Global Time cover, year end critics/media charts, cultural merit medal, raising over 1.6M sales for unicef, 10M w only Korean language
Sorry UN speech namjoon, flying joon this is my lockscreen now
Lmao mcm la korang xprnah banding2 kn org? Like those salty people who hate kpop the one who start the trend of comparing bts with something when their leader did the UN speech for the youth??
First kpop group to make a UN speech Mkay I'll wait for another one to do it
“Korea gifting Moroccan PM signed @BTS_twt albums” “BTS invited to Moscow to celebrate 30 years Kor-Rus relationship” “BTS performing at Kor-France friendship concert” “Greek minister hoping BTS will come to Greece” “BTS giving a speech at UN” TRULY NATION’S PRIDE, LEGENDS.

I think BTS is going to drop something MASSIVE in 2019. And it will be VERY controversial but a step towards acceptance in society. I just have this feeling and I have an inkling on what/who it will be... The teases for their next project coupled with RMs UN speech has me SHOOK pic.twitter.com/9OkQNqwo9E
Not a fan but I read about BTS #ENDviolence with UNICEF and their UN speech. being prejudice doesn’t make y’all even better. Peace.
Me ha gustado un vídeo de @YouTube (http://youtu.be/gFAiU7C6bdA?a - Wanna One Sungwoon reaction to BTS 'Artist of the year' speech @MAMA
I used to have really bad anxiety about past mistakes and had really low self confidence but the LY series really helped me break free of these things. Namjoon's UN speech also helped me feel better about myself! Thank you so much @BTS_twt !!
BTS has come so far this year and if you think 2018 wasn't BTS' year then you're dead wrong. They've started their 2nd world tour, performed at the BBMAs, won MANY awards, attended the UN conference and Joon gave a BEAUTIFUL, LEGENDARY speech, became the global ....
my favorite @BTS_twt moments of the year are the UN speech and MAMA ArOTY winning speech. they make me remember why i love and respect these boys so much
Matthew McConaughey at a bts concert + UN speech
honestly? what made me want to stan bts was the un speech
Telling you to love yourself,RM's UN speech is used in school curriculum today because of its content and how much it speaks to people,and that is bts music for you,they dont only have fan girls,they have fan women and men because people see how heavy their lyrics is.its just bts
Last night, i was watching Namjoon's UN speech amd my mom asks "Your Korean boys again?" And she watches the speech wih me and is amazed by Namjoon, then we watched MAMA hongkong and we ralk about @BTS_twt for half an hour and i start tearing up when i shared about their

My brother needed to do a report on an important event and he chose to do BTS speech at the UN. I’m so proud!!!!
#BTS #Namjoon I honestly think Namjoon would make a brilliant president or some sort of public speaker. He speaks from his heart and is so very wise, and if his UN speech was anything to go by, he'd be amazing pic.twitter.com/A8MDeGk1H9
Well BTS won 10 Daesang this year for their music, they got RIA certification, they were invited from UN to delivery a speech because of their music message, they are included in many respected playlist recommended by critics bc of their music.
Namjoon's opening speech + bts' entire performance was directed to the concept of "following your dream and being real to yourself by living your life". That intro fit perfectly into the concept and NJ recalled it dm for the UN speech, which he recalled during mama too.
Last night, when my mom and I were watching Namjoon's UN speech and i explained to her why i loved @BTS_twt so much https://twitter.com/KOOKIEHOLY/status/1075360731292266497 …

one of the weirdest experiences from my college career was walking into eng 121 to find my professor watching namjoons un speech projected onto the board then having to hear my classmate explain bts to him and him nodding and agreeing to everything told to him
there is always a way. and also Namjoon's UN speech. theories after bts drop a new hint somewhere. they supply so many interesting topics to talk about, their world is filled with amazing phenomena
BTS didn't win all those awards, go through hardships, contemplate disbanding, get nominated for grammys, set records and break them, got to UN AND GIVE A @#$%! SPEECH for you all to use their hard work, their efforts, to 'throw shade' on twt, stupid plebs, ruining our reputation pic.twitter.com/pttQ6MvLUu
imagine being a homophobe and stanning bts when namjoon mentioned the lgbt+ community in his UN speech and hobi even mentioned us in his acceptance speech at the MMAs
I just listened to your UN speech. Of course you can change the world. Truly are you not all amazing artists but truly amazing people who are actively trying to change the world with the amazing platform that you all have been given. #RM #ARMY @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @bts_love_myself
well if u think like that then you should know you're going against bts' principles go listen to namjoon's UN speech a few times and come back when you understand
Thank you @TIME for mentioning their AOTY and ArOTY daesangs, UN speech and sold out concerts. People who don’t know about @BTS_twt will not think they’re popular ONLY as meme lords but will also read about how incredibly impactful they are in this society and the music industry. https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1075107221271470081 …

for example when bts literally went to the UN and Rm gave a whole fucking speech and a bitch on T.V was like "Their a boy bad from Korea lol." like wtf?! Not only that but others in American media continue to downplay Asian artist success despite them being amazing artist and
To add to the list: all the members of BTS. They even gave a speech at the UN. #BTS
remember how namjoon gave his speech at the UN like "Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser and that would be me too" and then literally the next day bts were doing fortnite dances on jimmy fallon kjfdhkjdh
LoveYourselfAnswer is #3 on the list @BTS_twt "The highlight of this message, as RM eloquently stated in a speech to the UN, is to own your mistakes, to accept your faults, and to “speak yourself,” using your voice to be true to yourself no matter what" https://unfspinnaker.com/73356/features/spinnakers-top-10-albums-of-the-year/ …pic.twitter.com/n0yVWy0g6F

BTS First Airport win, ARMY Independence Day, Jincult, UN Speech, BBMA comeback.... and more lol
When I showed my mom bts’ UN speech she immediately said “send me the video!” Hope she forwards it to her 50 groups with 100 moms
Did I just tell my 80 year old student to watch @BTS_twt UN speech? Mayhaps.
My favourite memory of BTS in year was BTS attending UN, namjoon’s speech and BTS winning AOTY and album of the year at mama
Fr the difference between other groups and bts is that they’ve bonded with their fans to a whole new level and are more active and genuine towards spreading their message (lyrics, the campaigns, un speech, etc)
Looking back at the AOTY speech made me aware of these small things that were said in Magic shop and in the UN speech.I’m so thankful that they trusted us with their honesty. It’s nothing I take for granted and I’m so thankful we are still walking together in this path. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/btBdHLELwp
This really reminds me of @BTS_twt Rm's speech at UN. I'm so proud
i think my favorite memories included MAMA and UN speech. those 2 events inspired me so sooo much! also burn the stage movie because that was the first time we anything bts related officially in our country!
Bts saved the world from impending doom with that UN speech and are nominated for a Grammy. What have your faves done? Quickly
one time i showed my english teacher bts' UN speech nd she told me that namjoon was a nugget of wisdom, ,, my spanish speaker ass didn't catch that it was an idiom so i called namjoon nuggetoon for a month
(you can steal my idea) but i was either gonna do a 2!3! lyric or a UN Speech quote
Favorite 2018 BTS memory were UN speech, debut in billboard and MAMA HK 2018! they worked very hard and achieved a lot of awards. Team work makes the dreams work. And tha k you for doing this GA borahae pic.twitter.com/zT9bxJgG8v
My favorite moments with ARMYS this year has been celebrating BTS' birthdays, festa, armyhive collab, outcast, anticipating Hope World, when Euphoria dropped & we thought the cb started & the album would be called LY: Wonder , all black haired BTS, glitch party, UN speech
Armyhive, flirtaus au, hopeworld and mono, bbma comeback stage,LY Tour! UN speech, jk gc on fancafe, all the memes from Fort Worth lol oh and just generally how much closer to 'mainstream' bts have become (the other day I heard fake love played at Walmart )
So many this year. My favorite moment has to be UN speech. It proved bts are beyond just being musicians. Also it bring them multiple steps closer to the dream of being most influential artists.
BTS UN speech was 3 months ago. That's how far we've come!! #BTS @BTS_twt
Just a little advice for people who go through things like this: if someone belittles BTS and it frustrates you, tell them about the UN speech, the UNICEF campaign, the millions of dollars their fans donated to charities; try to remember every touching story you've ever read+ https://twitter.com/BTS_ARMY_INT/status/1074184946443530246 …
That’s also where we find the first mention of his heart stopping as a nine or ten year-old (UN speech).

I talk to my irl friends about them sometimes. Not a lot tho bc I don't want to force bts down their throats. My irl doesn't like kpop at all (its not her style of music) but she'll listen politely and is interested if I talk about their UNICEF stuff or their UN speech

Hi @janetjackson even with your speech in MAMA about female empowerment BTS ARMYS will always find a way to degrade female idols
You observe people and you know their personalties and values And then you present BTS from the side you know they value or acknowledge, and being real casual, letting them lead the conversation And hitting them with the UN speech always helps pic.twitter.com/6iFdujSYRm
I swear, BTS members go viral every month lmao First Hoseok IMF challenge, that Jimin clip where he looks breathtaking at their concert, Namjoon's UN speech, Yoongi's fancam and now that Jungkook video hhhhh Only two members left to have 7 viral moments
some guy (who follows me lmao) was coming for bts and saying they were puppets, etc. so i sent him a link to joons un speech and i haven’t heard from him since. i think he decided to stan but is scared to admit it

I know it can be hard to open up to your parents but I would really focus on how BTS makes *you* feel better (in the end, you are what matters to them). The speech on the UN and the cover in The Times are good "unbiased" examples of our amazing boys are and their message

The un speech live. Really shows the significant impact thry have on today's youth and as the world's leader it was during that time people know bts is not just a kpop group. They are more than that. They are the youth's representative
Un speech
so much has happened. but the un speech is one of my favourites along with citifield
@BTS_twt thank you for not disbanding even though you all were mentallyill.Thank you for teaching me how to love myself.Thank you for making me fight depression.Before your speech at the UN I was very shy to open up but after your speech i feel confident. #ThankYouBTS #BTS #ARMYhttps://twitter.com/btstwt_______/status/1073662743813738496 …

imagine if bts had disbanded this year: we wouldn't have had ly tear and answer, the tour, burn the stage and more, we wouldn't have seen our boys getting the recognition they deserve or giving a speech at the UN, we wouldn't have had "so show me" "i'll show you"

if bts would have disbanded we wouldnt have gotten the un speech and im really struggling with that.
I'm not going to brag but I got an A+ for the rhetorical analysis about RM's speech at the UN. If they really disband, my score will reflect nothing but the sarcastic sadness.

Thankfully they stayed together & didn't disband. #BTS in 2018: * The pride of Korea * The best promoter of Korea & products * Won 100+ awards * Won 12 Daesang * Top all kinds of Korea, US & world charts * Broke Korean & WW records * UN speech * Stadiums Imagine the loses.
we could’ve lost it all the billboard #1, the un speech, the times magazine next generation leaders, the order of merit award, the grammy nomination, the ly concert but most importantly we could’ve lost BTS only if they had not decided to stay #ThankYouForStayingBTS #ThankYouBTS
Imagine if @BTS_twt decided to disband they'd have no: BBMA stage Sold out stadium tour TIME cover Box office success UN speech 1st Grammy nom for KPOP Order of Cultural Merit AOTY daesangs Don't give up on the light even thru your darkest hours. #ThankYouBTS for this lesson.pic.twitter.com/dtOaQ7zjs6
I can't believe here i am, writing my analysis on @BTS_twt UN speech for my M.A essay after stubbornly arguing with my prof on why this piece of text/discourse is so important, and how, "just" bc its from a "kpop boyband" make it all the more important
Ho aggiunto un video a una playlist di @YouTube: http://youtu.be/vcsxHOl1w68?a [FULL HD] All Awards BTS Won + Acceptance Speech @2018 MAMA
But BTS break that statement, they aren't only singing and dancing but also make us become "NEXT GENERATION LEADER". Speech in UN Forum and make campaign to be more love yourself it is really really good #ThankYouBTS
Beneath all the glitz and glam of being a celebrity, I just wanna reflect on how this year has been so incredible to @BTS_twt from their sold out concerts across the globe to their endless awards and to their speech at the UN. Despite all these, there were controversies that -
The Nicki collab, the bbma award & comeback stage, the un speech, becoming ambassadors, Grammy nomination, if they didn’t push through no one of these would’ve happened, which is why I will always be eternally grateful for bts staying faithful just a little longer #ThankYouBTS
She was upset even though she pretended she wasn’t but I told her that BTS always tells us to love yourself no matter who you are, I showed her Namjoon’s speech at the UN and I told her if she wants to like them no one can invalidate her feelings or interests or identity.
this must have been one of the most emotional days since stanning bts not even citifield or un speech got me like this
@BTS_twt today i showed the UN speech for my english presentation about youth and someone said bOrInG... #ThankYouBTS for teaching how to deal with Hate #players_gonna_play_live_a_life_man
Ever since the un speech I had been thinking about how I need to be my own source of happiness and not only rely on bts for that but then joon said how he used us to help himself love himself and that we should also use them to love ourselves
@BTS_twt You guys have inspired me so much, and showed me that I can give as much as love to myself through loving your music that seeing yguys can actually make my heart flutters and beats. Even during the UN speech, when RM said that, I could only think of yguys.
My besties are non kpopers. But they said they know BTS bcs they saw you giving speech on UN and they got impressed
this year BTS won 12 Daesang, 116 awards, got 3 gold RIAA, platinum RIAA, double platinum RIAJ, over 5M albums sales, 2 #1 albums on billboard,performed at BBMAs & biggest US & UK shows,held own concert at US stadium,Grammy Museum,speech at the UN, Grammy nomination #ThankYouBTS
BTS has changed my view of life and the world so much this year. Without LY:Tear, without the UN Speech, without THEM, idk what kind of person I would have become. They helped me get closer towards self-actualisation. I DONT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THEM. #ThankYouBTS
I want to share how I became an ARMY. I knew BTS since 2016 but you can't really call me a fan then. I became one when I watched RM's speech in UN. He moved me to tears. His words resonate deeply to me. I knew then he was special. So I started to listen to "Mono". #ThankYouBTShttps://twitter.com/dtownsonic_suga/status/1073617595222286337 …
After thinking about disbanding, they got 2 #1 Album on BB200, Top10 Hot100, BBMAs debut stage, Grammy Museum, UN speech.. Their 1st album this year after their hiatus, Tear, is a Grammy Nominee.. #ThankYouBTS for staying for everything. @BTS_twt
Namjoon I am so proud of you! You worked so hard this year and have grown into a man with a beautiful soul! I am so proud to have you as my hero. I even used part of your UN speech for my graduation! Thank you for teaching me to love myself little by little!
#ThankYouBTS For staying with us, not only with us FANS you are helping many many people with UNICEF and Love Myself, Like Namjoon mentioned in his UN speech i really came to love myself along with you guys @BTS_twt Thanks for Staying with us. We are proud to have you in our life
Last time i was crying this bad when BTS make a speech in UN.. And i'm crying again this badly bcos we just know we almost lose them .. #thankyoubts for staying with us. #ThankYouBTS for believing each other. #ThankYouBTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/LZPbiBMf3R
Compared to painful tears... We had tears of joy.... Tears of warmth.... Tears of happiness .... We were proud of you @BTS_twt countless times.... All those trophies to great records.... That incredible speech on UN..... Proud is an understatement +
BTS have been nominated for a Grammy this year, became the youngest recipients of the order of cultural merit award, did a SPEECH AT THE UN, have won over 100 awards THIS YEAR ALONE and are STILL humble,grateful and genuine when winning an AOTY daesang. #ThankYouForStayingBTS
If they disbanded, they wouldn’t have had to go through all the pain. Yet, if they did, they wouldn’t have had all the glorious times either. Tear and Answer. UN speech. Becoming ambassadors here and there. Inspiring the youth. Walking with us. #ThankYouForStayingBTS @BTS_twt
Do you just imagine all the things we wouldn't have had if BTS disbanded? The UN speech, the end of the Love Yourself trilogy, unicef campaign... all of it. But the boys pushed back and survived the termoil and came out stronger to sign a contract for seven more years.
this is a french article about BTS... Let me tell you, it's a good one. Speaks about their achievments, the UN speech, the records etc I'm so happy pic.twitter.com/A6MlEfFWX6
watching BTS hold a speech in front of the UN in a seminar AMA
YALL LITERALLY IF BTS D*SBANDED NAMJOON WOULDNT HAVE GIVEN HIS UN SPEECH AND I WOULD BE **** OHMYGOD I FEEL THE PRESENCE OF GOD
bts were really thinking about disbanding in early 2018....my heart just broke into a million pieces...like,,, imagine if they actually did disband???? TEAR, ANSWER, UN Speech and all these broken records....none of this would've happened if bts stopped believing in themselves.
Do you understand they talked about disbanding right before their giant breakthrough. 1st K-album to land #1 on billboard, UN speech, 1st K-artists to play a US stadium, global recognition, multiple youtube records. When I say BTS are god's favorite children...
this year was so beautiful for BTS. Sold out concerts, UN speech, changing lives on second to another and making them and their family proud. An honour to be beside 7 incredible men. @BTS_twt WE LOVE YOU
i'm telling you, bts BETTER win artist of the year, the IMPACT they've had on spreading so much positivity?! THE UN SPEECH?! you're smoking dick if u dont think they don't deserve this
How can you give that award to W*nna One if BTS won Billboard, gave an speech at the UN, had the biggest album sales??? HOW??? WE ALL KNOW WHO DESERVED IT. payola came out.
When Namjoon came out I really thought he was about to rap the UN speech #BTS @BTS_twt
#2018MAMA Yalll BANGTAN SONYEODAN IS JUST PERFORMING AND OH MY GHAD IDOLLLL AND OH MY GHAD THAT FUCKING INTRO WAS ONE OF THE BEST THAT LOVE MYSELF INTRO NAMJOONS UN SPEECH AND OH MY AND THE RAP LINE OH MY GHAD I CANNOT #BTS #BTSatMAMApic.twitter.com/Ynac0KhlLl
A quick reminder — O!RUL8,2 was part of Namjoon’s UN speech— @BTS_twt
Guys!!! Remember Namjoon quoted O!RUL8,2 in his UN SPEECH!! No please don’t tell me that we have to theorise Namjoon’s in speech too @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ckMPjeh48L
Check out the lyrics y’all rm bouta perform this he also referenced it in his UN speech #BTSMAMA2018 #BTSatMAMA #2018MAMA @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/GsVm_I51tHU
Of course!! Here’s the important bits: -BTS got an award on the red carpet for promoting Seoul -Namjoon opened MAMA with a speech homage to the UN one -Got best MV, best style, and a think a few other awards, were really silly onstage -They will be performing in ten minutes!
Just sayin that I’m incredibly proud of Namjoon. Opening up the awards and spoke like it was the UN speech ? Korea is truly porous of him and bts for making big changes
Who all got reminded of the UN speech by our president NAMJOON #RM #MAMA #BTSxMAMA_HK2018 #BTSMAMA2018 #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/OsJuJqJuCA
The WHOLE TONE of MAMA HK this yr is INSPIRED by @BTS_twt ~ their UN speech & their continuous msg & openess in talking abt their Challenges, Passions & Dreams... MAMA has NEVER b4 put fans or socially concious msgs @the 4front. Thank u BTS 4 changing the K~musical LANDSCAPE! pic.twitter.com/QiE0cmaNe6
I am all for group unity and I know RM is too! But sometimes it is funny when I see people say BTS gave a speech in-front o the UN...BTS introduced Janet Jackson. Yet, only one spoke. lol
same man did a speech for un #MAMAHongKong @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/9_DDaE/status/1073537334006575105/video/1 …
I talked about the LOVE MYSELF campaign for my final presentation. I showed UN speech to my class. #BTS #BTSLoveMyself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/PoDxoSxoqN
namjoon opened the ceremony w. words from the un speech. bts won the top 10 thing?? i forgot what it is
Tbh whenever Joon said “Hello my name is Kim Namjoon also known as RM from BTS” I thought he was gonna say his UN speech again
this is No longer an award show this is a bts concert complete with skit: UN speech [remix]
Who else got chills? This reminded me of his UN speech. #BTSatMAMA @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/btsvts_/status/1073537520464408576/video/1 …
For sure, this is an allusion to his UN speech, isn't it? Even the same suit.
when joon said “my name is kim namjoon also known as rm of bts” i thought he was gonna start his un speech at mama
WHEN HE SAID " MY NAME IS KIM NAMJOON ALSO RM FROM BTS" I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SAY THE UN SPEECH AGAIN https://twitter.com/BTS_National/status/1073537977278758912 …
Namjoon is truly embracing his vulnerability & using it to inspire others. With the UN speech & tonight's opening, he's claiming a new title that I'm sure he'll reinforce in 2019. Such excellence w/ words is impactful for so many & I'm really grateful he's nurturing it. @BTS_twt
Wow Namjoon opened MAMA with his speech, that was inspired by UN speech wow #MAMA10 #RM @BTS_twt #BTSatMAMApic.twitter.com/2DIFyAQs4d
WHEN RM CAME OUT AT THE START AND STARTED DOING A SIMILAR UN SPEECH I NEARLY YEETED MYSELF OUT THE WINDOW I AM SHOOK #BTS @BTS_twt #MAMA2018
WE LOVE KIM NAMJOON'S UN SPEECH REMIX VERSION! #MAMA10 #2018MAMA #BTS pic.twitter.com/Xi7sVagtGo
For a sec I thought of Namjoon's UN speech? #BTS #MAMA10
BICTHEEB WHEN NAMJOON SAID IM KIM NAMJOON OR RM OF BTS I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA DO HIS UN SPEECH I
I legit thought he was going to do un speech #BTSatMAMA @BTS_twt
Arsgsgs I thought it was a joke about the un speech remix #MAMARedCarpet + #BTS
Ok, so MAMA is a whole UN Speech homage?! @BTS_twt #BTSatMAMA
"My name is Kim Namjoon and also RM of BTS" "What makes you dream?" Who else is feeling major UN speech nostalgia right now? @BTS_twt #2018MAMA
He started with his UN speech but then talked about dreams!
You guys are true, LMAO. It's a remix of Namjoon's UN speech!!!! #BTSatMAMA @BTS_twt
I THOUGHT NAMJOON WAS ABOUT TO REDO HIS UN SPEECH IM #BTS #MAMARedCarpet #2018MAMA @BTS_twt

@BTS_twt joonie perform the UN speech king!!!
listening to namjoon un speech every day. MIGHT not be fully there yet but thanks to bts i’m learning to love myself
@BTS_twt You are on the cover in 1 article about UN speech of Junior Aera Magazine.... #BTS pic.twitter.com/TgnGTAzpbt
I agree makeup and genre style dont make people queer but bts has specifically and intentionally showed support for the lgbt community. From RM saying he likes Same Love for the message to saying "gender identity" in his un speech
bts: *talks abt lgbt+ rights in a super conservative country, make a speech in the un about accepting oneself despite gender, race or sexuality, rap abt sucking dick* some rando on twt dot com: the heterosexuality of this
i cant believe bts released tear and answer tHIs year, gave a speech at UN, performed on agt, attended grammy museum, and released 2 mOVIES. ALL IN LIKE ONE YEAR DKSDJSJ WHAT
Whoa! UN speech did that!
The UN speech because it really meant a lot and made me so proud @BTS_twt #MAMAVOTE #BTS
Namjoon mentioned gender identity (ie. trans people) in his UN speech, Namjoon tweeted about a song about same-gender love and a song from a movie about a gay man, BTS have worked with multiple LGBT artists on production,
About their message, I suggest you to watch BTS leader RM speech at the UN. It think will help you understand what I mean.
@BTS_twt At work today the VP of the bank I work for had a meeting and I saw a bt21 shooky keychain on her keys. I asked her about it, she said, "I may be 56 yrs old but, I saw the UN speech and fell for their self love, can't help it." We fangirled for like an hour
Oh no no.... The first one is for a video for my YouTube channel That's whyI listed down all the BTS MV's name And Namjoon wrote the second one . It's a part of the UN speech.
I remember in 2017, i thought that bts reached their highest peak and cant top what they’ve already achieved but in 2018 -UN speech -grammy nomination -2 gold RIAA - #1 on Billboard 200 -Citified concert thats not even half of it. now im scared what 2019 has in stored for them
@BTS_twt Can smb shop the Idol clothes with UN Speech? Really I beg u pls pic.twitter.com/z4J1AhHiai
They won the BBMAs Top Social Artist for the second time (they won last year's). They were on the front cover of TIME magazine. The got 2 albums which both got BB Hot 200 #1. They did their famous speech at the UN. The received Order of Cultural merit by the South Korean gov.
BTS was voted by 21 out of 25 industry reps: “Is a reason necessary in choosing BTS?” which means ‘fukk yeah we voted for Bangtan, there was no doubt at all’ And 18 out of 25 also chose their UN speech and BB200 #1s as greatest moments of 2018 @BTS_twt #VideoMTV18del18 BTS pic.twitter.com/5I9o33pOI9
OH MY FUCKING GOD MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS ARE WATCHING THE UN SPEECH BY BTS pic.twitter.com/cdTp6dUpKC
it is INSULTING to refer to bts as “queer” when there are artists out there who have done so much more ???? stop discrediting everyone else just because bts is big internationally . want to talk about bts? talk about their self love, end violence campaign. talk ab their un speech
Bold of you to assume your fave deserve Worldwide Icon of The Year, when BTS & ARMYs have won BBMAs voting against Bieber fans & not to mention BTS global achievements outsold your faves, let alone their UN speech. pic.twitter.com/Z3vE5lckcs
Congratulations BTS! 대상 축하해요! #방탄_월드와이드아이콘상_축하해 #월드와이드아이콘 #WorldWideIconOfTheYear #방탄소년단 #BTSatMAMA_JPN #BTS @BTS_twt And Congratulations ARMY! #우리아미상받았네 BTS said “face yourself” reminded me of RM’s “speak yourself” UN speech
Of course! We will never forget that, it is the most beautiful and powerful speech from Kim Namjoon ever ! :') Besides it is an honour for BTS and us to speak at the UN #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/jRabG073Zq
Kim Namjoon also known as RM is the leader one of the most famous and influential groups in the world BTS. He is very intelligent his IQ is 148 meaning he is in the top 1.3% in Korea.He is trilingual speaking fluent English,Korean, and Japanese.He recently gave a speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/HozKP39VSI
One of my fav quotes is when BTS had speech at the UN such a motivation "I have come to love myself, for who I am, for who I was, and for who I have to become. What's your name? Speaks yourself!" #SpreadTheHappinessGA3pic.twitter.com/FwdZYV4I2h
Ok first, that’s Yoongi not Jin and you tell they are your favorite group. Then not even mentioning the UN speech is just ignorant. Also where is the most handsome man two years in a row like what. If you want to do an interview at least do it right.
Once again this man is the same person who gave a meaningful&heartwarming speech in UN, THE BEST LEADER and great brother to his 6 members @BTS_twt KIM NAMJOON. Guess he get a chance to have convo with NASA now.. so r we space for real now?!? https://twitter.com/ggukreum/status/1072839260766498816/video/1 …
Me, listening to Namjoon UN speech and @BTS_twt music: I am gonna learn to love myself. Also me: Why would I love myself when I can love BTS lol
Just watched bts’ mama performance tell me why the one who did the UN speech is dressed like the Michelin man
nope i still remember the painting u did with joon's quote from the un speech that was so beautiful shush
His citifield speech about using BTS to love ourselves and the UN speech
Namjoon the President of ARMY Nation the leader who gave a speech at UN the artist who inspired millions of ARMY Also Namjoon Bangtan's Baby Boy @BTS_twt #Namjoon #RMpic.twitter.com/0bXM4t65d0
In RM’s UN speech, he speaks about speaking up yourself right ? In the nxt cb, the concept may be about not being afraid for being who you are, to accpt youself, to ovrcm your fears until then, you completely love yourself. #MAMAinJAPAN @BTS_twt @bts_bighit
Get this. The leader of the biggest boyband in the world who gave speech at UN like a pro wore an astronaut costume and danced the shit out of stage and ended up falling down on butt. #MAMA #bts
Yes this is kim namjoon my sayang. Leader of BTS, the one who give speech during UN, the tallest in bangtan yet the smallest tiny baby boy https://twitter.com/rkivesyoongi/status/1072840640046788609 …
BREAKING NEWS: After the successful UN Speech, @BTS_twt leader,Kim Namjoon will give another speech on NASA very soon. Apparently he just landed on the moon. https://twitter.com/ggukreum/status/1072839260766498816/video/1 …
Congrats to @BTS_twt for winning Worldwide Icon of the Year at #2018MAMA in Japan! This year BTS raised the bar! The group wrote Billboard history for Korean artists, made an iconic speech to today's youth at UN, and were dubbed 'Next Generation Leaders'. pic.twitter.com/PFiCXsk5Gh

"My favorite boyband" Has a title that says most memorable/best moments in #KPOP Confused #JIN and #SUGA Talks about collabs waaayyy too much rather their UN speech, records broken in 2018, their movie, 1st stadium concert Looking for collabs ...i ran outta space ...clout??? pic.twitter.com/jUBFCHZuQQ
side note: she really is a Namjoon stan ever since I found BTS. She admires how much talent & creativity he brings to the world. She even has his whole UN speech on her phone because his words made her cry
I got writers block and lost motivation to finish my essay so what did I do?? I watched Mr. Kim Namjoon's speech at the UN. Thank you, @BTS_twt for helping motivate me to be better in any way possible for myself. Thank you for everything. Thank you for being you.
I'm scared and curious about what 2019 would bring to the boys...who could even imagine that BTS was going to deliver a speech at the UN? or get 2 1#on BB200 or have their album at 11th best selling album of sk When I was watching BS&T on 2016 I've never dreamt of sth like this
AND NO MENTION OF THEIR UN SPEECH AT ALL ???_??? seriously
Thanks Vivi He knows about the UN speech, but was never interested enough to read the transcript. I'll definitely show it to him after we talk some more today :)
The UN speech @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTS_Billboard/status/1072679648943845379 …
I’m positive that this is a message for antis tho... They wanna have an opinion on EVERYTHING bts related, whether that’s a Grammy nom, a UN speech, or a BBMA... they literally can’t leave bts alone. They always wanna belittle and degrade bts so the “no opinion” thing is a buffer pic.twitter.com/vgN7odq4TX
@BTS_twt Dear 깁남순 It's my pleasure to write this letter to you. I'm your big fan because I'm a A.R.M.Y. Your song and dance are so good and I listen to your song every day. I watched your UN speech. In it you said ❝Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.❞
So Niki & Sammy had a talk with Honne on their collaboration with @BTS_twt RM's Seoul in mono playlist. I'm glad they actually paid attention to the meaning behind mono as well as they talked about Namjoon's speech at the UN. Do listen to the full podcast https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xxsh4/episodes/downloads …
Some suggestions, try talking about his UN speech and the lyrics for mono https://doolsetbangtan.wordpress.com/mono/
Bbc intetview Staff: bts act professional Bts: AcT PRofESSioNaL UN speech Nj: jungkook if any of them fcuks up im breaking all your controllers and downloading a virus on you computer Jk: any of you bicths move you die
My teacher for my communications class said somebody in another class gave their persuasive speech on “why you should listen to K-Pop” and he got into it so he started playing BTS in our class. I also told him to listen to their UN speech and to check out Burn The Stage
Bts proceedings of the love yourself albums have been going towards unicef. Their fans have donated thousands and millions to unicef something your fandom can seem to do. THEY GAVE AN INSPIRATIONAL SPEECH AT THE UN REPRESENTING UNICEF. WHY WERE YOUR FAVS NOT CHOSEN?
I'm having so many realizations about myself and none if it started until @BTS_twt.I dont know if that makes sense but for the longest time I've been curious about why I do things and why I react the way I do.I think what made me start thinking, and looking was Joon's UN speech.
I'm actually new to the fandom... I have known about BTS since HYYH1 but I didn't really fangirl that much at the time. Then... Mean Friends > Feeling Lost > UN Speech > IDOL > BTS pic.twitter.com/G38SgFiLlx
OK BUT WE GOING STAN HONNE FOREVER they said how most boybands are more superficial but there is so much depth in what bts are trying to put across and they mentioned joon's un speech and you can feel how much respect they have for him I'M TOUCHED :(( https://twitter.com/cestlavie_90/status/1072274609683103745/video/1 …
They absolutely deserve it because they're trying to spread important messages through their music and not only. You should see their UN speech which was held by the leader of the group Namjoon. I was so moved by this speech. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
@BTS_twt have been doing great work this year with the UN speech and being the Next Generation Leaders. Plus their constant message of loving yourself has been a great message for several fans around the world.
Bts giving a speech at the UN, being on the cover of TIME magazine, getting a gold RIAA certification for their album, and getting nominated for the GRAMMYs
I’m honestly so proud of them and seeing people recognize their talent and outspokenness really means the world to me. Their UN speech was the peak. I can’t wait to see what 2019 has in store for @BTS_twt and us.
Funny how people think this. Even if the fandom for some reason wouldn't like poc, bts wouldn't give a sht because they are supportive of diversity. Someone must have missed their UN speech.
Nam: Hello? Me: H-Hello? Nam: Who are you? Me: W-who are you Nam: My name is Kim Namjoon *UN speech voice* Me: *dies slowly* @BTS_twt
namjoon literally wrote a mixtape, had a speech at the UN, saved my life and did a lot more things and he calls himself LAZY. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE THE BEST HUMAN BEING ON EARTH AND YOU DESERVE LOVE? THAT'S ALL YOU DESERVE @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/GFU4ztCNLl
K media, Newsis selected ‘Top10 News of Korea in 2018’ & one of news is about @BTS_twt “BTS became an existence who is beyond the Kpop” listing what they achieved in this year, BIllboard, AMAs, UN Speech, Grammy nomination & the Order of Cultural Merits. http://naver.me/FB0qg1qP pic.twitter.com/VFcOtc2iDy
i really wanna show hellevator to my parents... they have a good impression of bts ever since i showed them their UN speech and the lyrics to jin’s epiphany as well as answer: love yourself and although i love bts, skz are my ults and have helped me through hard times-
Thanks for sharing this Now I am thinking coz of bts I have seen so many things Live stream of Korean,American award shows,Good morning America,UN speech & now a Ted talk Out of those, this Ted talk & UN speeches were very motivational. I hope I keep seeing such things coz of bts https://twitter.com/BangtanSeaDayak/status/1072405221098340353 …
You’ve just replied as Namjoon did on GMA when he humbly said “I think I did it ok” when asked about his @BTS_twt speech at the UN. Your translation feels like Namjoon’s words, we have heard him in English, I’m so grateful for your efforts.Thank u! https://youtu.be/MvF8-sQqaqY
Busted a lung Did you just say bts is flopping?? Omg are you dreaming??? comeback to me when you find your faves name on grammys,,have 10msales,bb200 #1,,hot100 top 10,,un speech,,bbmas and amas,,plus more okay? Next???? Oppss wait i forgot!Wake up,on ur delulu dream
My moots call me yas, so i guess that’s that. And um There’s too many favourite memories like the un speech, when they cried during concerts because they were touched aaaaaa there’s so manyyy pic.twitter.com/68gVIwDOIu
Uwu yes as you can see the flooding amount of links ppl replied on this. But, I took up their un speech and I'm going to talk about their message and how they've always been different from other groups.... You can talk about that....

I watched bts speech in UN for the second time and actually it really left me marks. Might be late but it makes me in tears and he kinda gift me support that I didn’t receive even from my own fam.. I guess music give me that power huh?
I highly recommend you check out the speech that BTS held in front of the UN general assembly in September of this year. Perhaps it can humble you a little. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg

She's blatantly accusing joon of not writing his UN speech. That is called FALSE ACCUSATION.
Dear bts I watched your speech of UN. I am glad that you have not given up And then may fortune be with you by the minute your fan form Taiwan @bts_bighit
Omg I just remembered about that annoying news anchor who rude to bts after their UN speech!! A ese vato si le doy unos vergazos bc he was super annoying!
Anyone who discredits BTS' work is an anti, imo. She literally said that Namjoon didn't write his UN speech That's not an opinion, it's just factually incorrect and disrespectful. If you disagree then you can get the electric chair too. https://twitter.com/einoojnatgnab/status/1072293374328213505 …
When I watched your speech in the UN Hall, I cried. And thinking about what you've done, you and BTS have done, and how far you've come, it makes me happy. You taught me that I should love myself. And I'm trying harder to do so. #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear @BTS_twt
Namjoons speech at the UN is still one of my favorite speeches I've ever heard. Everything he said was absolutely beautiful. Im so proud of Namjoon and the rest of #BTS I really don't know what I'd do without them and their music. I love you so much! #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYearpic.twitter.com/FU9Xx0tnnh
@BTS_twt 's Leader NamJoon (RM) 's speech at UN was one of the main highlight of 2018, his speech is so inspirational :) Also the way he express his words during their final ments and fancafe posts really makes my heart warm, his my role model :) #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYearpic.twitter.com/52u6cPCWQ7
i stan bts since their UN speech i know. a baby, right? but i am not a dumbfuck who doesn't even know the hardships that they went through and kissing rotten eggs' ass that siding with n/zi just because they hates my boys my iq is less than joon but i have common sense, people.
For #HumanRightsDay I want to bring back this powerful speech presented by bts’ leader RM at the UN a few months back. I am constantly inspired by the message spread through the love yourself tour over the summer, millions participated in something so important and massive! https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/1044441284772073472 …
I replied to her not knowing she was that way. I was like ok maybe some stans get their feelings hurt & feel entitled let me be reasonable. Then she twisted my reply saying Joon probably didn’t write the UN speech! Like I entered the upside down?!
I always get so moved and inspired by Namjoon’s words, whether it’s a fc post, un speech or lyrics. The very deep intellectual and philosophical way he’s expressing himself is really something else and it always makes me think. @BTS_twt #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYearpic.twitter.com/uy8seG2cFF
Namjoon, you have no idea the impact you have made this year with your beautiful speech at the UN. I'm so glad the youth has you & @BTS_twt as their role models. Such socially aware individuals y'all are, whom I love very much #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYearpic.twitter.com/OAMdpnKiJz
If namjoon didn't place his un speech the way he did i probably wouldn't open up about my mental health issues on here the way i did thank you. Thank you so much bc i feel a lot less alone and a lot more supported since then. I love you @BTS_twt #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear
my favorite @BTS_twt moment of 2018 has to be a tie between speech at the un, the idol dance challenge and when jungkook went busking in malta. i remember getting so many chills during all 3 occurrences. when they spoke for us, when they included us, and when jungoo touched my pic.twitter.com/FcEzTlXCr9
This person has never translated any BTS lyric in her life because she can’t recognize that Namjoons UN speech is a compilation of BTS lyrics/message since debut including a sections thats literally word for word.

#NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear On 090318 I got into BTS,since then my life changed in a good way.The words Namjoon said really made me feel like I matter and that I should Love Myself.I cried during the UN speech because of the beautiful words.NJ thankyou from the bottom of my
Known as RM and is a leader and rapper of a worldwide Korean group, BTS or Kim Namjoon, a 24 year old guy who had presented his speech at the UN, was a top 1% student in the whole nation, learnt english from the sitcom Friends, wrote and produced most of the songs and his mixtape
1 of my fave @BTS_twt songs is Whalien52. It gave me comfort bc I struggled to speak my mind, felt my voice couldn't be heard & didn't matter. His UN speech encouraged me to speak up, not to silence my thoughts & made me value what I have to say #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear
#NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear through his words during his beautiful speeches at the concerts, his posts on fancafe , his tweets , and by his presence. He is a pillar for my heart and soul. The speech he made at the UN still resonates inside me. Thank you Namjoon. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/FPVokYd1r5
You are beautiful, remember You said so many amazing words this year The speech at UN, every speech at the concerts Kim Namjoon We love u from the bottom of our hearts, u mean world to us If u smile we smile so u can use us too to be happy @BTS_twt #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYearpic.twitter.com/uzwDqrpu9n

There are two things that made me think a lot and opened my mind: his speech at the UN and mono. thank you because you know how to use the right words on every occasion and you proved BTS’ value to many people that were sceptical. you’re my king #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYearpic.twitter.com/QRErYRKtry
I’m so proud of my paper on Namjoon’s UN speech, I wish I could send him a copy And also, out of all the papers I wrote for my Analyzing Rhetoric course, this paper had the least mistakes @BTS_twt
april fools beardtan,jin's bday cult,when jimin missed hoseok so much,un speech,bbmas,when euphoria mv droppes outta nowhere,dora x bts,outcast,theres so much more but i forgot rjejfjejdjs
You made a big difference in my life, Joon. The first time I watched your speech in the UN Hall, I cried. Because I felt your words and for the first time in a while, I felt the desire to actually move and better myself as a person. @BTS_twt #NamjoonChangedMyLifeThisYear
Namjoon, the year has gone by so fast but look at what you and BTS has accomplished! 2 #1 on BB, UN Speech, the release of mono, BB win and performance, etc. Couldn't be more prouder of you. Even if you feel like it's nothing, it's more than we needed #VideoMTV18del18 @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NptDjGQEpl
Oh a verified acc?! Please educate yourself ma'am.. They promote self love and oftenly chose soacil-political topics for their songs. They sold more than 5M albums only in 2018.. Had a UN speech encoureging youth to raise their voices. Raised more than 1,5 M dolars for unicef
FYI this boy band called bts. They were on the cover of time magazine for being next generation leader. They are used music as their platform to addressed many issues, for example social justice like you said. Oh You may wanna check their speech at the UN.
Lol ok first of all look at the exo stans coming at every oppotunity to trashtalk bts. Losers.also u must listen to RM's UN speech where he said regardless of color and language we speak, we must always speak ourselves and make ourselves heard. He l loves many black artists too
Attending to their concert and UN speech/BTS presence!!! @BTS_twt
Their concert!!! It was their first time in Canada. It was incredible!!! And we cant forget their inspiring UN speech All the love they give and inspire!!
The UN speech
Breaking any barrier out there. I also mentioned something about their UN speech and their Billboard achievements. I also told her about their album LY: Tear being nominated at the #GRAMMYs Her co-worker said that #BTS only got these awards or nominations because of voting ++
UN Speech
The UN speech and Citi Field
BTS at The UN and Namjoon Speech
When I discovered their music and started stanning, the launching of Love Yourself: Answer, the UN speech, the announcement of the GRAMMY nomination...
Hmm... 1. Tear topping BB200 2. Fake Love top10 hot100 3. The UN speech 4. The "bts as" threads when BTS were inactive 5. #BTSGlitchParty 6. April 1st and Jin's shenaniganshttps://twitter.com/hxseojk/status/1071844939653414926 …
@BTS_twt UN SPEECH! AN HONORABLE MOMENT EVER pic.twitter.com/0flz4l6mF3
I’m 100% agree Also , during MMA vcr’s you could heard parts of the skit “R U HAPPY NOW” +namjoon talked about this in his UN speech how happy he was and reminded to us that it’s from one intro to their old album , this and the skit is from “O R U L8 2 ?”
THE MOVIE WAS THE BEST ALSO THE UN SPEECH
2018 was an a year of achievement for bts but if i had to choose it is the un speech
I only watch BTS' parts tbh. Tho, I did watch the beginning until the end of RM's speech at the UN Summit, the first time I ever watch a summit for world leaders, let alone an event as political as that
BBMAs and the LY:Tear comeback (first cb as an ARMY dnsbajakak), the UN speech...watching Burn The Stage...And when they went in the UK? Haven’t felt more alive during that week ngl djsnaksna pic.twitter.com/YTmvbPOhCV

what do chinese fans have to do with the chinese government mass-incarcerating muslims because of their beliefs?? do you really think BTS would want us to stay quiet during a situation like this? specifically after the amazing speech namjoon gave at the UN a couple of months ago?
songs that should replace all national anthems: -outro: tear -the tomato song from that one bts run episode -just namjoon’s un speech -annyeonghaseyo jeoneun bangtan sonyeondan hwanggeum makna

Aren’t BTS amazing? They manage to get a Grammy nomination, announce Reebok and Hyundai, have BT21, cultural merit, billboard #1, most tweeted celebrity of 2018, UN speech, etc. While that side are doing hardcore job to promote their faves. I love BTS and their faces. https://twitter.com/konymobal/status/1071627888485556224 …
the best memory for me is hearing BTS live in LY tour but in army twt is deff their UN speech i was shakin like crazy from emotions and feeings i never knew i could feel. the tl was very proud of our 7 boys https://twitter.com/hxseojk/status/1071844939653414926 …
every moment was special. honestly. but bts & namjoon giving a speech at the UN. really really touched me.
I have exactly the same experiences. I was in semi hiatus from kpop because CNBLUE are in military. Then RM speech in UN made me curious about BTS. Still, I was in denial until I listened Jungkook sang 'If you'. Now, i love both fandom BOICE and ARMY
Mine is of course bts at the UN. Namjoon s speech really inspired me. I was touched. And thankful #speakyourself #BTS @BTS_twt
things i think about on the daily: army twitter getting emotional and proud of bts at un speech
My best memory of 2018 is when our leader gave the speech in UN. Such a proud moment! I am glad and happy that I am an army. Even though my real life is a mess but I love bts because they make me happy when I was the saddest and at my worst.
YT rewind is boring! How about @BTS_twt rewind? What was your favorite moment of 2018? For me, I think it'd be a toss up between Tear debuting at #1 on the BB 200 over PM & the UN speech. Both had me in tears!
Every moment with bts is my favorite,but of course the one that stands out a lot to me is their UN speech. thank you for for doing this GA
Ya'll really gonna talk about 2015 stuff when in 2018 bts as a whole group decided to omit the word "naega" from their song cause it sounds like the n word and said that black people could get offended ? Namjoons un speech? While in whole 2017 - 2018, one member referenced kunta+
Please hear out BTS leader speech at the UN too https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=19 …
Anyways, here's @BTS_twt with their UN speech about speaking yourself and accepting yourself for who you are https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
Y'all this year i was depressed af and totally insecure about my self but really the love yourself campain especially namjoon's speech at the UN really changed me and since i started stanning them i get happier everyday.

Its like at what point do you give bts the credit that has been well deserved since 2016 or are y’all going to pretend to play this game that nothing they do is ever important. But i got my answer for that when namjoons UN speech was criticized for no reason
Right all I'm asking if something to show her faves at least know they did wrong but girl jumps but BTS shows her all receipts even the UN speech Joon he acknowledged he fucked up

To 2013 @BTS_twt Remember how tough it was, small company, no one thought you could make it.See where you are now.

i literally do not care what any non army has to say about bts. i said i was done arguing with them after the UN speech and i meant that.
Every beautiful moment with them is my favorite. There is a lots of think to say but recently this year The UN speech was really special for me and cheering for them from long distance in their world tour was really amazing. Thank you for 7 days of Kpop we really enjoyed it.
BTS could’ve ended up anywhere but they ended up together. Call them overrated but that just gives them more reason to rise. BTS deserve all their achievements. Doubt me if you want, but listen to Namjoons UN speech.
This year @BTS_twt got : - a premiere cb stage on BBMAS - twice #1s BB200 - first US stadium show - UN speech - received The Cultural Merit - box-office record for Burn The Stage - a GRAMMY nomination The fact tht they achieved this in just one year scares me how 2019?

2018 really been the year though BBMA UN next generation speech Now Grammy nominations BTS really on another extraterrestrial plain
P r o m o, it's not hard to understand. The boys got a lot of new fans from BBMA, AMA, UN speech, imagine their fanbaae after attending anx performing ( may be ) on Grammy.
From Today whenever I see an anti speaking about Views , Music Shows and other stuff.... You got that UN Speech ,Pure Album Sales and GRAMMY NOMINATION tho ? No ... So sit down sweetie and focus on your faves . #BTS @BTS_twt #GRAMMYs #BTSXGRAMMYS
While others talking about K music show, youtube view and tagging their fav on twitter, we have evolved to bigger scene, we talk about UN speech and Grammy nomination, We are truly out there. @BTS_twt is in a class of it's own ...
Dear 2013 BTS, you fuckers got nominated for a GRAMMY. And you're TIME's Person of the Year. And you sold 10 million albums. And you had a speech at the UN General Assembly. This was a great year for you. Love, 2018 ARMY.
Honestly im glad they nominate #BTS (album) at #Grammys There's no way they don't have a chance - BECAUSE CONCERT AT CITI FIELD, SPEECH AT UN, MILLIONS OF STREAMS, MILLIONS OF ALBUM SALES, TOP GROSSING DOCUMENTARY FILM, UNICEF CAMPAIGN... like siS wtf are that doesn't enough?
BTS got awarded a BBMA, cultural merit award, 7 daesangs in MMA, gave a speech at the UN and now they got nominated for a GRAMMY all in 2018. What gives you the right to say your faves are better or work harder than mine? Quickly. #GRAMMYs  #GrammyNominatedBTSpic.twitter.com/yAEx2m7vR4
this year bts won 9 daesang, over 100 awards, got platinum & gold riaa & riaj certification, over 5M albums sales & two #1 albums, 5B views, top10 on bb performed at bbmas & biggest us tv shows, grammy museum, gave a speech at the un, and got a cultural merit medal plus more
Now when antis talk shit, we can add #GRAMMYs to the list of all the other achievements of BTS! These include Billboard, cultural merit award, 7 daesang record in MMA, UN speech and more! UWU #KarmaIsAnARMY :)
@BTS_twt getting all the awards, performing to prestigious stage, invited and do a speech in UN, getting #1 album this year. Nominated or not still I am so proud of our boys.
so,,,, i was talking to my aunt and she told me that she’s proud of BTS when she watched their UN Speech :( bc of the Love Yourself campaign. she said that its different and unique :(( PLEASE IM CRYING AND PROUD
As you read there "BTS" is a band from South Korea. These guys transmit messages through their music and songs. They gave a speech at the UN and promote campaigns with them. His last tour "LY" sold out in 20 minutes 45k of tickets in the citi field!!!
Iam so nervous it feels like onetime bts about to give their un speech
To add @OneInAnARMY has never said that they don't believe or will not support any projects related to LGBTQ+. These are assumptions made up. If they ever host a project, it will include all of BTS as they’ve all shown their support AS A TEAM when they made their speech at UN.
I hate BTS like they put me on such level of stress on a daily like UN speech Citifield BBMAS and now the Grannies ?? Like aight can they calm down ? So I can breath ?

#RM is the Leader of @BTS_twt! He is well known for his amazing rapping skills along with #Suga and #JHope! RM also composes and writes songs for #BTS. He recently gave an inspiring speech at the UN conference this year! Hands up if RM is your bias #7DaysOfKpoppic.twitter.com/CwxwoTRu6I
Today is Grammy noms day and my timeline has been buzzing about it... I just want to say, no matter what happens I'm so proud of ours #BTS boys. Personally for me the speech at the UN wins any day. Not many artists have got that achievement. Anyway, looking forward to it.
"The first Korean singers to give a speech at the UN"... "If BTS wins a G award...it would be"... Imagine thinking giving a speech at the UN is some "accomplishment" other groups can follow behind, and of all things thinking the prestigious Gr*mmy award is "easy" to achieve.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL. It's REAL. If you want to introduce @BTS_twt to someone start with RM's Speech in UN. My friend is now so hooked that now she doesn't feel sleepy if she doesn't hear fake love at least 10 times. I love this "listening BTS song in a loop" culture pic.twitter.com/PjsM5I4NwG
@MysticMongeese They gave speech in UNGA for the launching of UN new empowerment program for youth, @_GenUnlimited. Parkland students indeed deserve it too. But please don't disrespect BTS and their fans. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=19 …

I try and try every day to gently persuade my local friends into stanning bts and even though they get so much exposure on the web, are a highly-acclaimed music act and even held a meaningful UN speech it's all to no avail. When will my locals realize?
BTS fans already did uncountable charities around the world. From providing clean water, foods, donations after earthquake, plants trees, & other donations. BTS gave speech in UNGA for the launching of UN new empowerment program for youth, @_GenUnlimitedhttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=19 …
IF bts don't get the grammy nomination i'll better not see other fandoms talking shit UNLESS their faves have 3 albums top 10 on bb 200, UN speech, 5 riaa certifications, a sold out stadium in the US, the best selling korean album of the century and fastest 10 million album sales
When they went abroad n met army they were confused "who is bts oh bangtan sonyeondan whos them oh so they big". Bt got 2 bbmas, amas, the whole un speech, invited to grammy museum but kmedia wont talk abt them hhhjj
IM CRYING. I REALLY AM. I’m rewatching the UN speech and it’s hitting my deeply. Thank you @BTS_twt, thank you for opening me and become stronger. Thank you for being by my side, and thank you for making me feel better. I love you
Someone that lives in the same floor as me told me that a friend of theirs told her that BTS is in history books now due to the UN Speech. I’m soo happy!! @BTS_twt YOU GUYS ARE GREAT I LOVE YOU
this is actually pretty great... talks about UN speech and the self love message... thanks♡
BTS topped bb200 twice this yr with non English albums Soldout city field in 20 minutes Gave speech at UN Time magazine cover 4th best selling artist in pure sales in U.S Top 8 artist of 2018 in BB etc...
Let's never forget what an amazing year this has been for @BTS_twt and ARMY. What is your most memorable BTS achievements this year? Mine would have been their UN speech, LY: Tear gets #1 on BB200 and Cultural Merit Awards pic.twitter.com/IQToUCFFTN
Who’s BTS? They have campaign to “Love Yourself” in their album, and give an amazing speech in UN for young generations. They deserved it. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Reporter) @BTS_twt made a speech at UN for the first as Korean artist and they are now on top of the world representing the youth as global icon. Twitter announced that BTS has been mentioned the most in Korea Japan Brazil Spain Mexico and more. +

Korean rapper @namjooncharm delivered a great speech on self worth and self regard at the UN, for the Love Myself and #endviolence campaigns. @bts_love_myself https://speakola.com/ideas/kim-namjoon-rm-korean-rap-love-myself-un-2018 …pic.twitter.com/rd2m1pMVa5
My best BTS moment was their concert the 20th october in France it was amazing to see them in real and to hear them singing We tapped our feet on the floor and they were impressed it was wonderful I loved the UN speech too I used it in my oral presentation in english
Yall!!! We went to an orphanage yesterday and all the kids love BTS!!!! Lets just say I let them watch Namjoon's speech at UN and taught them how to be an OT7 stan. MISSION COMPLETE.
In the car, I listen to Namjoon's UN Speech to remind myself to be empowered. At the airport, I can't forget to stop by the Lotte Duty Free shop. Getting onto my plane, I realize that other armys are also taking the same flight as me to go to one of BTS' Love Yourself concerts.
@BTS_twt put the UN speech on spotify cowards
There are several things YOUR faves will never achieve anyways hello there we are 13 albums 10 Million sellers, kma grammy winners, cultural merit owners (which is higher than the president award) and UN speech special guests BTS now show your 387 albums into your a$$
my friend dont actually know bts but hes listening to their songs since im sending links eveytime theres a new release and one time he saw pics of bts at my ntbk and he pointed out namjoon saying "id like namjoon before but when i saw hes speech at un i suddenly love him" IM EMO-
Namjoon yah @BTS_twt , im sorry that i still can't love myself after all the un speech
meleis being so salty about korean, kpop, while tb3 news about sk group, RM UN speech, BTS dominate Spotify~~~,,, they keep going forward and make money being rich while these problematic people, just being busybody attention seekers
they re nothing to compare with bts yg dah give the UN speech tell me something goods next time pic.twitter.com/x51ZXXTs6S
my friend got me to know bts but i decided to stan recently when i watched their un speech and jimmy fallon interview!
big mood. thankfully we're seeing an increase in other awards (PCA etc) so our social media stuff is definitely helping. Also, they got medals lol that's awesome. most of their philanthropic recognition is definitely through stuff like the UN speech and UNICEF work
1)when kpop said BTS is too westernize and Dddaeng and Idol MMA18 happen 2)antis try to sabotaj Tear cb and she end up debuting no.1 on BB200 3)UN Speech and Time Cover mah
I showed my dad Namjoon's UN speech expecting nothing but he was so immersed in it, the man actually cried to it and asked me to play it for my mom. @BTS_twt impact knows no age or gender.
@MNEK's "Crazy World" @BTS_twt Namjoon's UN Speech same vibes tbh
@MNEK's "Crazy World" @BTS_twt Namjoon's UN Speech same vibes tbh
@TheTodayShow do you know @BTS_twt? Most tweeted account for 2018 @Twitter Most liked twt for 2018 Recently gave a speech at the UN for UNICEF Generation Unlimited Peformed at BBMA AMAs GMA AGT, been on Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, James Cordon, Ellen. PS now Ed Sheeran collab
@BTS_twt I just wanted RM to know that I memorized your UN speech for my speech class because it meant so much to me and to show my support to you guys. love you guys. (P.S I got a 99% on it) #bts #RM #takespeech
My favorite BTS moment would have to be the UN speech and when Burn the stage was released. Luckily I was able to watch it!
if he is producing then this'll be the next turning point like the un speech was, bts isnt a fad anymore, they are ingenious creators & you will put some respect on their name bc they are here to stay & leave their mark pic.twitter.com/S5j6aMn90P
like them more and more curious about them. After that I would come across BTS content once in a white. Like their billboard appearance I think and fancams etc so I kind of got familiar with their faces. But it was Namjoon's UN speech in September that really hot my attention. It
My favorite moment with bts this year is the UN speech because it made people understand that bts meant BUISNES or the LY tour. I didnt get to any concert, but during this tour they all seemed so HAPPY, they also seemed tired, but overall I think they were just glad to see us!
Bitch, im not even kidding when I said I’m going to use BTS’ UN speech as my subject on my research. pic.twitter.com/lUfXQeKRVX
like bts don't talk about being allies. like bt21 themselves didn't write mang as a boy and girl. as if joon didn't talk about gender at the UN. as if hoseok didn't mention different types of love in his speech.
All the year end charts and tweets do not mention the bop that was Namjoon's speech at UN.. @BTS_twt @BangtanINDIA @bangtan_india #BTS #BTSARMY #BestOf2018 #UNICEF #handletteringpic.twitter.com/XtZGEIxKqP
But I can relate my brother dislikes kpop,he hears it everyday from me lol he said he doesn’t like it but he respects BTS a lot because of what they do,the anti violence campaign, the message they spread, and he liked RMs speech at UN but he’s such an ass he said BTS is generic
Nice speech
Maybe also have the UN speech
My favorite BTS moment was when BTS gave his speech to the UN (´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`) ( I'm sorry if it's misspelled, I'm Latin American )
Hi Mr. Namjoon @BTS_twt. I got my MUET result today. And i did it! Thanks for your inspiring speech at UN last few months. I think the examiner love your speech.
sometimes I feel afraid to read comments about our boys. there always are bad comments. I am still remember about UN speech that some fandom in Indo call our boys liar etc. overall, majority of Indo army give our best to stream mv/songs and buy it bcz bts bring happiness to us
BTS has specifically mentioned those who weren’t able to voice themselves in Western Mainstream Society in the UN speech. To Mainstream world they announced their world. This speech would be a very clear message to non-white teens in US+
My fav BTS moment this year is UN Speech they’re look so cool there specially Namjoon, i’m so proud of BTS and ARMYs too
My favorite BTS moments of this year are the UN speech, their comebacks, mixtapes (Hope World and Mono), as well as their world tour and the MMA performance. I will never forget those. And recently, the cult culture ajsjxhe
She edited an article headline when BTS were talking at the UN and wrote sum like “Kpop Band BTS tells world youth to kill yourself at UN speech” and posted it on her IG story.
My favorite bts moment this year was the UN speech rm gave. Even if you don’t like bts (which you must be crazy to not like) this speech is so powerful and beautiful! It’s actually my yearbook quote! (I also just wanted to add this beautiful picture of Jin HAPPY BDAY JIN) pic.twitter.com/8HkBmmJbZA
Attending the LA LY concert, the speech at the UN, when bts came to be part of the jin cult, all the awards they've won, all the songs that were released this year their AAA and MMA performances, stan twt coming up with "bts as __", and so much more
My Fave BTS moment is when they're having a good time in their BONVOYAGE S3, the speech at the UN , winning daesangs in awards show with a big and great stage performance @BTS_twt #BTS Saranghae
This is the beginning. They gained a lit of fans after UN speech and US promotions, so everything just began for the boys
UN speech. It was one of the most iconic things that BTS has ever done.
There are many of them, for example watching Burn the Stage movie, or UN speech, BTS Prom Party and and and
did we actually get hopeworld, mono and lytear, lyanswer and un speech and time cover and comeback stage at ama's and a nick collab,japenese version and still had time for theories and all them billboards and jintro in 2018. damn almost killed me but @BTS_twt are now highlanders
um just watch rm's un speech for allll the motivation lol. also, if you study well, get good grades, get a nice job, you can meet bts sometime soon! that's what i keep telling myself to push me to get through college xD "kill them with success and bury them with a smile"
my fav BTS moment of this year was the Joonie Un speech, because i was happy and proud of the boys.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY! My favourite moment would have been either the UN speech (due to the issues that BTS were promoting) and obviously, the BTS Concert in London on the 10th of October... I miss them
I believe that every BTS moment is the best but I will have to pick out their speech at the UN because their word impacted and helped many people!! And another moment was when I attended one of their concerts because it honestly was the most beautiful day of my life
my fav bts moment was definitely the UN speech & seeing them on the time magazine cover
THE MMA PERFOMANCE WAS ICONIC AND BTS SPEECH AT THE UN
The UN speech and getting to see them in LA were definitely the biggest highlights of the year for me. Also, just the fact that they became more popular with the gp and are getting the recognition and respect that they deserve #BTS @BTS_twt
BTS UN SPEECH MADE ME CRY HUHU
I have a lot but my faves are, BTS winning BMA's, the speech at the UN, the appeareance in TIMES, MMA performances and every new release of their music in general, i love them
Bish this was me when I had to do a reading for the church of my whole school.. I thought of BTS and then of RM who went to UN to give a speech on English that he taught to himself if he can do it so can I and I did it and everyone was like DUDE IT WAS GOOD
im how BTS stood at the UN and made a whole speech about speaking yourself but apologists think BTS would "be ashamed" that we speak ourselfs
My favorite moment of bts will have to be their UN speech I remember watching it live and putting it on TV to show it to my family and telling them how proud and happy I was of them i cried like crazy and felt like a proud mommy I SWAER
seeing this makes me think about Namjoon’s UN speech.. if by chance, was that related???
I’m in biology and as my professor was lecturing BTS at the UN Hq popped into my head and I thought about Namjoon’s speech and I just got emotional, I’m so proud man
My fav moment of bts this year when they come to UN and namjoon gave a speech there, its just like so many adult ppl or even our parents listening to them and its just like they're so amazing and everyone start to recognize them Not only teens but for all the generation haha
My favorite BTS moment this year:the second Berlin concert,because I was there~~ Jkjk I guess the UN speech..it was amazing Actually every moment they got recognized and appreciated for their work And the moments there were just enjoying their lifes 2018 was a good year
When BTS attend UN and namjoon speech to campaign love yourself
my favorite bts moment(s) this yr -srry can’t choose one loll- is their UN speech, their Hyundai commercial, announcing their world tour even if i couldn’t go i’m still so proud and happy for them, them coming out on time magazine and @BTS_twt joining the kin cult lolll
Everybody here says the UN speech. I think so too. As you can see, the boys have outdone themselves again this year. 2018 is truly BTS's year.
I liked so many moments this year... But the most memorable was Namjoon's UN speech @BTS_twt
my favorite moment of BTS this year are: 1. UN Speech. i remember crying watching it on periscope live. it was an overwhelming feeling of PROUD 2. THEIR COMEBACK. my PRIDE was skyrocketing bcs we all worked hard together to bring BTS to the top. chart, sales,etc. so happy!
My fav BTS moment of this year is when they had a speech at the UN. I was touched listening to RM Speech that I teared up. “No matter who you are, where you’re from, your gender identity, your skin colour, just SPEAK YOURSELF.” -BTS I PURPLE YOU BTS
My fav BTS moment was the UN speech, I am so proud of all of them. Also shout out to when they decided to join our crackhead fun for #JINDAY
When BTS did speech in UN and they achieved what they deserve......every moment is my favourite moment that I spent with them
My favorite bts moment of this year was when they gave there UN speech. I was super proud of them
I have a looot of my favourite moments with BTS breaking records here and there! if I need to choose one, it would be the UN Speech! They inspired a lot of people, including myself. (TQ for the GA)
Fav moments: UN speech, MMA performance, reaching number one twice on BB200 and april fools day with @BTS_twt
My favorite moments of BTS the UN speech and also was when after 5 years I was finally able to see them in concert from row on September 8 in Los Angeles it will for ever be my favorite moments
I really would appreciate a masterpost of all these solo stans who claim to be ARMYS to report/block. They dont get BTS' message. They didnt get Namjoon's speech at the UN.
I have a lot of favorite moments like all the awards shows they went to, the UN speech was so inspiring but out of all of them my favorite was going to the BTS concert in Newark I would never forget it
FAVE MOMENTS: -UN speech -the last run BTS -yoongi in that chimmy costume -Mono.
I think my favorite BTS moments of the year had to be Namjoon telling us to use BTS to help love ourselves, their UN speech, and the MMA stage. Each one of these made me feel such a sense of pride and belonging, words can't even describe the love I felt during these moments
when bts delivered their speech to UN. that's the most highlighted moment of bts this year. oh and their performance in mma
My Fav BTS moment in this year is when they give a speech at UN, meet with Presiden Moon Jae In & his wife, get many Award like Merit Culture from their nation "South Korea" which is they're very young to get this award in that time, MGA and MMA yesterday! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/UOpWogkH3Q
My favorite BTS moment was when they gave the speech at UN or their performance at MMA or when they literally just landed in California I loved every moment honestly every smallest moment with them is the best
BTS bon voyage s3 , their fake love comeback stage at big awards, idol comeback. UN speech . Burn the stage. Hyundai model, AAA and MMA stage. When they win two daesang .. Everything that happens this year was too amazing .. it just like a dream ... Sorry for my bad english
@theactualjin Favorite moment from bts has to be the UN speech. Namjoon’s words were very touching and very powerful for everyone, not just Army’s. It was a very proud moment for us and for them. Love my boys
My best craft this year @BTS_twt RM UN speech snow globethe illuminated script was made by @acupofgreentaepic.twitter.com/HFLUUb4ywT
my first bts moment would have to be the UN speech it was so touching pic.twitter.com/j1lGBqRe5A
Every BTS moments that just happened this year is totally incredible but for me one of the bestest thing that ever happened is when they have the UN Speech that makes me more proud of them. It gives me more reason why i do love them so much!
the un speech... i probably wont win even if i did i probably wouldnt be alive to receive it so good luck to the winners!! although since my mom is a bitch and giveaways is the only way i can get bts/bt21 merch
This year every moment of bts was the best for me honestly... but if i have to pick one, for me, i would say it was when they gave that speech at UN... i felt like a proud mother!! @BTS_twt
Ohhh, my favs moments in this year are the BBMAs, the comebacks, the UN speech, the MMA performances and now, the new layout @BTS_twt
My favorite Bts moments is the un speech because I learned so much from it ugh I love them
they r BTS a korean group. They have a lot of influence for their songs that talk about political issues, mental health, self-love, struggles etc, but mostly bc of the campaigns they create for example the Love Myself” campaign with UNICEF and their speech they gave at the UN
fav bts moment is their un speech no doubt
I talked with my dad about #BTSatMMA and their un speech and how much impact they're making and he teared up that they were doing so much for youth empowerment and dismantling toxic masculinity and discussing mental illness and I'm just really proud of our boys today @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/vAVrSTG2l6
My favorite moment this year with bts is their UN speech, it was such a big moment within kpop history and the message they spread when they went was actually beautiful
As much as I love MMA performance, I would have to say I am the proudest when BTS were invited to UN, and our leader RM made a meaningful and impactful speech. pic.twitter.com/yUatSKAhuu
omg 2018 has been crazy for BTS and armys. my favorite moment would probably be their UN speech bc that was a big step in showing how BTS has impacted the world. WORLD LEADERS WERE THERE IFNDNEK. but another “moment” that i will never forget would be attending their concert in LA pic.twitter.com/aOswwmHAGK
the UN speech,, definitely one of the most pivotal times for bts this year.. the speech was so powerful and moving and just perfect.
BTS: respected kpop group who managed to spread their music around the world, had spots in Billboard, performed in many stadiums around the globe, had the chance to deliver a speech in UN, became everyone's inspiration, promotes self-love and ending violence also bts: crackers pic.twitter.com/ntIrYlL8jw
the un speech :^) it really exemplified bts’ global impact. it helped solidified the positive influence they have on the new generation, and they spread such an amazing message with it !!
uHm the UN speech, MMAs, and bts changing their pfp to the jin cult
one of my favorite moments from this year would have to be the start of their Love Yourself Tour-- Them getting to see ARMYs all around the world and ARMYs seeing their faves + the interactions are so amazing. ALSO the speech that BTS gave at the UN <3- it was truly so beautiful
The UN speech @BTS_twt
The UN speech was my favorite BTS moment. That was when everyone else realized how I’m important and crucial their message is. pic.twitter.com/EOgc9MkjB6
So we just learned how to love ourselves, and we were taught about loving who we are. But BTS always says they love the fans so much, and in the UN speech RM asked that it doesnt matter who you are? But now BTS wants to get to know their fans, so they are asking the question +
The UN Speech and the Time Magazine @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/JYJbk3hLTZ
the fav BTS moment? I have many in this year, but especially I will never forget about the UN speech. It was so powerful and amazing, I realised then that BTS gives me the most love and I'm so happy to be a part of this community
Mine is the speech BTS gave @the UN
This year was full of accomplishments for BTS and one of my favorite ones was the UN speech about the “Love Myself” campaign by Namjoon pic.twitter.com/2dMbA2Zq5n
Since there is many to choose from... I’d have to say that my favorite BTS moment would have to be between the many accomplishments through award shows and the UN Speech. They really have proven that no matter where you started from you can succeed in so many ways :)
in english we have to create a presentation on a topic of our choice that has a meaning to us so i’m doing about learning to love yourself so im using namjoon UN speech and BTS’ song lyrics :-) pic.twitter.com/UZtTYrww3b
My favorite moment..??? There was too many but I’d say the UN Speech because it moved hearts all over the world especially ARMY and it showed people what BTS is not just a ‘boy band’ but so much more.
My fav BTS momwnt i this year are red hair taehyungie and also when BTS speech in UN. And in this year they brought a lot of trophies this year. and wait for the next trophy from MAMA
ahhhh i’m at the UN where bts gave their speech
So hard to choose. My favorite moment for bts has gotta be the UN speech, to have all their positivity and hard work come together like that it’s gotta be amazing and the speech was so so inspiring. For my personally, the LY tour in Fort Worth! Cont...
Namjoon's speech at UN will always be my favourite BTS moment. They not only made themselves proud, but I as an ARMY was left in tears. I'm so very proud of my boys. It made me feel that I stan the most dedicated and genuinely compassionate idols.
UN speech @bts_bighit
My favorite moment with BTS was Namjoon’s speech at the UN. His speech was so touching and meaningful. They did an incredible job and showed how humble and engaged they are. I’m proud to be a part of their family, and to help UNICEF thanks to them ! pic.twitter.com/GNZHsutnTI
The UN speech @BTS_twt
Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y?a The full speech that RM of BTS gave at the United Nations
I have no idea what my fav BTS moment is. So much has happened this year its absolutely incredible. A few that I am so proud of is the UN speech and them receiving the cultural merit award. I'm so so very proud of them! I can't wait to see what more they can achieve next year!
There’s been so many wonderful @BTS_twt moments this year! Seeing their speech live (online) at the UN is at the top for me, next to reading about their accomplishments in their TIME Magazine cover edition.
yall, did anyone translate that speech that rm did at the UN thing into korean? i need it for a thing im doing and i dont want to trust google translate lmao plz help #BTS #RM #speech #BTSLoveMyself #ARMY #LoveMyself #LoveYourself
And also I just remembered that Joon said in his speech at the UN: Speak your self, And he said WHO YOU ARE ! If we think that thy hinted in their bbmas speach the next them, this can be true too. @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/ilsansqueen/status/1069382694910550016 …
My favorite moment was the speech at the UN, the concert in citi field and its billboard performance @BTS_twt
This is why I love BTS. They truly love all AMYs no matter who they are. Namjoon during his UN speech said "no matter your skin color or gender identity love yourself" and here Hoseok spoke about the LGBTQ community. https://twitter.com/hopejhs_/status/1069178082890788864 …
Everything seemed to be rhe best yet the UN Speech really have changed me a lot. That moment, I guess I cri. No, I cried. @BTS_twt I purple you
Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/Z5HCklBs_mU?a [ENG SUB] BTS - Artist of the Year Acceptance Speech @Melon Music Awards (MMA
Their speech at the UN , it's really a huge thing for me because that speech really gave me a lot of courage @BTS_twt
the hint is there since UN speech. im speechless.
It's when BTS speech in UN. Thats time i see them and i said "I never wrong to STAN BTS LEGEND." Seriously, after that I wannabe like RM who always saying positive Word's and share to everyone in this world about how really important to LOVE YOURSELF Tysm for this GA pic.twitter.com/jTjC3oghK4
My fav moment is when they go to give the speech in UN and I feel so touched by their words @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/kkEZTBo2bP
UN speech. It was an extremely big moment for BTS and Army. The speech that Joon was so nervous about was absolutely amazing and it will always be in my mind when I need it
Maybe it is not know your self, it may be speak your self because of namjoons UN speech. He said who are you? Speak yourself
This year was very special for #bts and army’http://s.so each n every moment was special. However UN speech is and will always be the most memorable and proud memory for me. Watching that speech i feel so proud and warm. Thanks for giveaway
It's how this country works. Just like the government, if you wanna be noticed, to be acknowledged and to even expose yourself, you need to prove it to these guys on a whole new other level. Apparently @BTS_twt and their bag of trophies and UN speech won't cut it
Me : Hello! Want to know bts? Here a footage of them giving speech at un, a bunch of songs that will motivate you, they launched love myself campaign too! Oh! They are the nation's pride too! Here the proof of them performing cultural perf on mma Dumb m*lays : oh well. Plastic
My favorite bts memory of 2018 is Namjoon UN speech, they did so well and I feel so proud of them
Definitely the UN speech. That was huge!! And I'm so proud of them, especially Namjoon. That speech went viral and more people got to know about BTS in a more positive way.
And maybe the speech on UN “Speak yourself “ is just a hint
My favorite 2018 bts moment has to be their UN speech.
I just hand wrote the whole ass BTS UN speech now that’s what I call dedication
Boy meets a new way of living, where he changes himself, his actions and he doesn't do the same things he did in the past. The concepts fits perfect with Joon's UN speech.
In his speech at the UN, “Speak Yourself” was the focal point and he spoke about his past and what led to him being who he has become today. this could be the new era that focuses on BTS’s past that made them who they are today.

Because of the distorted voices in the #BTSatMMA performance and the #Speakyourself message @BTS_twt sent through their UN speech, I think that is A PART of their comeback. Among the voices that distort our choices that are much influenced by others, we need to hear OUR OWN.
Their 1st Performance in US Award Show,1st Comeback Stage in US TV,1st UN Speech,1st UK TV Show @BTS_twt @bts_bighit #2000DaysWithBTS #BTS_Debut2000dayspic.twitter.com/xG92mEZeXG
I put BTS UN speech
I don't think for YOU it'll be SELF though. It might be SAID or SAYS instead since they've already done SELF and it makes sense with their UN speech.
I have to remind myself that @BTS_twt : - released 71 songs - won 100+ awards - the youngest recipients to receive the Order of Cultural Merit - finished North America and UK/Europe tour - had a speech in the UN It all happened THIS YEAR. THIS. YEAR. 2018 2019, you ready?
Do y'all think we need to review the UN speech for clues or
@BTS_twt influenced me to the point that I don't harm myself anymore. I used to be a suicidal one before but everytime BTS makes interaction with us all of those thoughts just go away. I remember that day when RM oppa made his speech at UN, God knows how emotional i was that day.

they probably gave us hint during their UN Speech omg these two words "SPEAK YOURSELF"
What if Namjoon's UN speech was also a reference to the new era. "We have learned to love ourselves. Now I urge you to speak yourself". Sounds like the closing of the previous era, isn't it? And the words "WHO ARE YOU" at MMA #BTS #BTSTheories #BTSTheory #btsnewera #BTSatMMA
My favorite bts memory is Namjoon UN speech, bts can perform on bbmas and Charlie Puth x Jungkook Performance

Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/lJ-jwwYm7aY?a BTS reaction to Blackpink's Winning Speech [MMA 2018]
I’ve only started actively participating as a bts Stan for a couple months now (since around the UN speech), but I can tell you that they’ve impacted me x To start off, I identify as Agender and (mainly) sapphic—
lol called it from rm speech in the UN XDD #WhoAreYou is the next album trilogy XDD #BTSatMMA #bts #MelonMusicAwards2018 performance confirmed it XD
So I posted the Idol Intro on my FB in total awe of the dance line. My sister, (has gone over to the @BTS_twt stan side) was as hyped as I was. Then mom commented Ma: Where's the intelligent one who gave the UN speech? She really won't stop until she adopts Namjoon. #MMA2018pic.twitter.com/EBS6ITQq4H

some people still not tired of using “but my faves are better in singing/more good looking” card against bts huh? well surprise! not everyone prioritize looks and your standard of talent bish. U can’t use those things to make a speech at UN. Everyone can compete about talent+
This would make so much sense!! Cause at the UN speech namjoon said to find yourself so that you can speak yourself...to do that, u have to ask yourself “who are you” !!
Hm... This year is full of moments i'm proud of @BTS_twt. But the UN speech will go down in history. Not only me as army but their country was proud of them and i believe they were and will always be proud of themselves for that moment too @Nick_Motohirapic.twitter.com/MM9hLaaW8m

bts has an effect on dads, my dad watched their UN speech and asked me about their hyundai collab https://twitter.com/bts_sci/status/1068912453801496581 …
I think a way to make Idol's performance viral would be telling a big Facebook BTS fan page to post the video and then we go to like it and share it on our FB. BTS crack videos and the UN speech have gone viral there before, we should try the same with the MMA performance.
I feel like @BTS_twt's new comeback will be about identity. In RM's UN speech he talked about speaking yourself, and in the performance last night, it was based on the theme "Who Are You". I feel like these are hints to their next comeback. #BTSxMMA #BTS
That's why there's key sounds at the beginning of the VCR and Namjoon's UN speech, "Who are you? SPEAK YOURSELF." ALL THAT MAKES SENSE. @BTS_twt #BTS #BTSatMMA #BTSLoveMyself #FAKE_LOVEhttps://twitter.com/ilsansqueen/status/1068918828887871488 …
Today we had an English writing test and the topic was "learning new languages". Guess who wrote half of Namjoon's UN speech @BTS_twt
Someone said Namjoon's thank you speech today was like a UN speech. (Ofcourse, it's our pres. joonie..) cant find the original twt. When translated, it means that but non verbatim since I cant remember the exact sentence hehe :) #방탄소년단_7관왕_축하해 @BTS_twt

My favorite memory of BTS is the UN speech. It’s such a powerful and beautiful moment, really make me tear up whenever I watch it.
There have been 3 separate occasions that have reiterated why I support bts the way I do : - joons UN speech - experiencing them live (year especially) - today’s MMA stage They are so so so so special and I really can’t believe I’m witnessing their rise the way I am pic.twitter.com/YTcSwY7RrV

I feel the same. I want to add that perhaps it's also because they're everywhere. @BTS_twt are more than artists and family because they're also a worldwide brand, from promoting cars to tourism. Their appearance and speech at the UN really did it for me.
RM's UN speech has been used in exams of students in US,Korea and it's used in exams not because they are popular but they are very influential youths to people. https://youtu.be/ghO8KNcabQE
+++really show to everyone. The Love Yourself album shows us the first step into really accepting who you are. But looking back in Namjoon's speech in the UN "I have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was, and who I hope to become" maybe this small hint #BTSatMMA #BTS pic.twitter.com/Ws3cXoKjL4
last year bts always say love yourself even in the billboard speech they still say it and this year they alway talk about happiness and also from the UN speech they always say speak yourself too
in my powerpoint im introducing bts with the un speech picture because if they dont know how to flex, im doing it for them
The UN Speech and being on the cover of the TIME magazine @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/0vFhuH1aVY
y'all don't get to tell us bts AIN'T artist of the year WHICH ARTIST HAD THE BEST SALES, RECORDS & ACHIEVEMENTS THIS YEAR? BTS. who had a successful campaign to raise donations for helping victims of abuse? bts. had a speech at the un & are the most influential artists? still bts
My favourite BTS 2018 memory would be burn the stage. It was the first official bts event occurring in my country and it was my first time meeting my co-armys. Also the UN speech was a great moment..
My favorite moment of BTS this year was when RM spoke at the UN because them being there shows the power of their music and army! The speech was inspirational and powerful, which shows that BTS can really make a difference, regardless of the language barrier. BTS is the best!!
My favorite BTS memory of 2018 is: The UN speech. Because the moment I heard Namjoon, it was very exciting for me, I go through a lot of bad things and listen to his story, his point of view and with the words and thoughts that came to my heart it was beautiful. pic.twitter.com/0GJGETlyjX
stopped for a sec to think abt how bts antis lives must be difficult. always wishing and saying their next cb will flop or wtv and then: records broken, UN speech, millions of sales, suddenly Madonna casually uses their collab in a video.... phew, tough life
My favorite bts memory of 2018 is UN SPEECH It makes me think that are boys really gone too far and I'm so proud of them... From their hardships, it's all worth it They deserve the whole world They deserve to be loved pic.twitter.com/UyW2ISDid0
my favorite bts memory of 2018 is seeing them give voice & inspire the youth by giving out a speech at the UN. they really helped me to love myself & i was lucky enough to see them for the first time this year
It has to be the UN speech. That was my proudest moment as an army even my non army friends were impressed and that's saying a lot. @BTS_twt #BTS #MAMAVOTE
my favorite memory with BTS is the UN speech because thats when BTS when big history by speaking yourself as well loving yourself
I’ll leave you with a little snippet of RM @BTS_twt speech. That exactly what they are teaching us. “And maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and
my best moment of bts 2018 was when they went to the UN to give a speech is a great achievement as a group and as fandom Army @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/czMr37sxQ8

But, I did end up telling her a little about @BTS_twt and she was supportive. When she was back in England she even messaged me they'd be on Graham Norton, and she watched the UN speech. She's never said anything about their music, but she's impressed by their message.

Everyone asking why a 'kpop band' go do some research about BTS and all their campaigns with UNICEF,their UN speech and about their contribution to spread self love #ENDviolence #LoveYourself #SpeakYourself
AJSKAJSKSJAKKS how could u? U should turn in @BTS_twt lyrics or UN speech. Wonder what will he/she write
My happiest moments 1. Fire was my first comeback and I realized that I was gonna get sucked into this crazy world 2. BTS winning their first Daesang 3. Newark 3/23, my first concert with BTS 4. Namjoon’s UN speech pic.twitter.com/DChFSPEYar
What I’m looking forward tomorrow besides their performance and clues is their VCR. Hope MMA will include all BTS’ records and accomplishments this year including their UN speech.
I dead put BTS's UN speech in my kindness easy with 459 words
Blackpink weren’t called a generation leaders by time magazine and appeared on its cover and had 2 #1 on Billboard 200, or had a speech at the UN. I can list more but getting some paks is pale compared to bts’ year
But we can change that in this new generation since bts is like MJ who dearly believes in humanitarian work. They weren’t invited to the UN to make a speech cause of their pretty faces. They were their because of their campaign #lovemyself and signed up with the UN to
I posted about my scholarship interview before and how RM's UN speech came to mind then inspired me the answer to the question Well, news came this week I GOT IN look forward for my 2 years in SK maybe if I have chance I will see @BTS_twt concert there
Seven people who are redefining pop culture. They stretch far beyond being musicians and involve themselves in politics as well. Made a speech a the UN about their Love Yourself campaign, and partnered and donated millions to UNICEF. BTS is not your average group
Maybe you should educate on BTS's efforts. They made a beautiful speech at the UN and partnered with UNICEF in a Love Yourself campaign. They've donated millions and continue to promote their movement to end violence. They are not just musicians, they are involved in politics too
Every artists made 2018 a great year dude, if MAMA is fair, they will choose BTS, the one who brings honor to SK the most this year among all artists: Billboard 200 #1 twice a year, social media points, love myself campaign, UN speech, RIAJ, RIAA, most albums sold in 2018
It gets overwhelming when i brag about #BTS cuz now it’s not just about their music, strong performances, etc... I brag about their UN speech, UNICEF, talk shows appearance, brand partnerships, more new music... ahhh there’s just sooo much from one group alone! My pride
and also bts appeared in shows, did the UN speech, went to grammy museum, did a mini concert in the korea and france alliance while they were on tour too
Thank you so much @mangopickle28 !! I’m really happy that you liked it and was able to use it in your own creation. I can’t express how much this means to me. It literally made my day, especially since I worked so hard on painting Namjoon’s UN speech. Thank you for your -
Can you believe that BTS won’t get Artist of the Year either at Mama or at Melon? After their UN speech, Citifield, 4m sold albums, most viewed MV in 24h, world tour, Ellen, Fallon, their digitals, jamsil, all their brand deals, Love myself campaign, BBMA and AMA the list goes on
Get crafty and make @BTS_twt stuff. I made this this morning. The empty ornament and glitter are from @MichaelsStores and I used @AveryProducts to resize the image of @acupofgreentae ‘s illuminated manuscript of Namjoon’s UN speech pic.twitter.com/HS3NEA05d8
ok but honestly one of the most memorable moments this year was @BTS_twt speech at the UN and how everyone on Twitter started crying and sharing stories about themselves in order to #speakyourself it was beautiful and magical
@acupofgreentae I put your beautiful illuminated manuscript of @BTS_twt Namjoon’s UN speech in a snow globe ornament. I also printed it and framed for my daughter’s desk Thank you for making this. pic.twitter.com/VrWt2RWtzA
@BTS_twt I did thses in my art class as a project. I took a picture of RM from the speech at the UN UNISF. Saved it into my drive on the computer &put it into a website called lunapic & changed it around. Just wanted to share it with you guys. #BTS #art #artwork #btsfanartpic.twitter.com/EYUfxTmko2
Yeah. I just so sad that I've been missing out a lot of historic content this year compare to last year. I even only watched UN speech a week after. But oh well. Better to have a busy work rather than not working at all, they said.
i sent her a link of bts’ speech at UN, tell me i did a great job hahahaah (she didnt see it yet bc our tzs diff hahaha)
Just a reminder that he is @BTS_twt KIM NAMJOON who give an inspirational speech in UN and also the leader of BANGTAN. his cute right pic.twitter.com/5uBpV9QbJk
After watching BTS introduce the Palisade, I want it now. Love the empowering message of unity about the SUV and how every member defined family differently. It reminded me a lot of their UN speech Love this partnership #PalisadeWithBTS @BTS_twt #BTS
I'm on my senior year of political science studies. Hopefully i could finish college and graduate soon, my aim is to work for international organization such as UNICEF. BTS really inspire me with their UN speech, totally unforgettable moment
Expect a @BTS_twt commercial to always leave you feeling warm and fuzzy like a warm hug on a cold day. Loved how Joonie incorporated his UN speech in it MY FAVOURITE FAMILY #PalisadeWithBTS
U forgot jk spacing out when they were in NY and joon is practicing for his UN speech @BTS_twt
the more i watch this, the more i realize how much of an impact namjoon's UN speech had on people across the globe; what he says in this commercial is so tied to what he said in his speech
they make all these videos showing all of bts' achievements abroad, BB TSA, charting, AMAs, UN Speech, World tour and yet some way somehow mess up their mics and stages...
Not to mention that speech at the UN breaking a record that hasn't been broken since One Direction and having award shows moved according to their schedule and that's just happened this week they've done so much this pic represents a lot of it but it needs to be updated pic.twitter.com/79nuT4aut9
Feels just like another UN speech..I swear these guys make me proud on a daily basis. #BTSxHyundai #PalisadewithBTS
me too..it's "just a car ad", but why does it feel like they deliver their second UN speech.. my hearteu can't contain.. #PalisadewithBTSpic.twitter.com/fkhfQ1KGpK
Me: How did I win AOTY AAA: You breathed BTS: Wait but we had 2 albums Top BB200 & UN Speech & OUTSOLD & stadium tour... AAA: We never asked you to do that BTS: AAA: Next recipient of AOTY - you may know him - he’s been a janitor here for many years...
@BTS_twt Congratulations on all of your awards last night u truly deserve them and the world! Your speech at the UN really changed me as a person! I can honestly say that I’m starting to Love my self more everyday because of all of you! #ARMYLOVESBTS
Loved the promo and messaging - it was stunning! Loved the reference to RM’s UN speech. My first time watching an auto launch and no regrets. Amazing job Hyundai Time for a new car!
"Nationalities, ages, skin colors they are all welcome today’s definition of family for all remarkable families around the world." My president always delivering great messages. For a moment I feel back again into UN speech. So proud of them. #PalisadewithBTS @BTS_twt
This is more than just a simple car ad just like their UN Speech BTS broke the boundary of what’s perceived as “traditional” or “the norm” they’re inclusive & accepting ! && that’s why @BTS_twt was such a great choice ! Thank you @Hyundai #PalisadeWithBTSpic.twitter.com/rEF5mwGHmf
I'm getting flashbacks from the un speech how can they always be so thoughtful towards everyone
They just had to throw a whole segment of joon's speech at the UN in a damn car advertisement bc bTS Is dAT gLObal GrOUp Spreading social awareness around the woRLD
That commercial was so cute! I like that Joon kind of reminded me of his UN speech lol and they all spoke English oh and Kookie was driving lol @BTS_twt #BTSxHyundai #BTSxPalisade #BTS
They looked and sounded beautiful. Their English was exceptional. I like the theme of family as well and that they seemed to use Joon’s UN speech as a guide for the script.
Straight out of the UN speech. Hyundai is totally capitalizing BTS strengths.
Hyundai had BTS speaking in ENGLISH for the introduction video before revealing the SUV for the first time. The topic was the diversity within family & it basically felt like a continuation of their UN speech. Our boys are becoming worldwide faces for inclusivity! #PalisadewithBTS
so my counselor sent out a google form a few hours ago and it’s for senior quotes. i want to make mine funny but not inspirational unless im quoting something bts said like namjoon’s un speech :)) IDK what to do !
I’m excited for my yearbook. I went to a bts concert and I took the picture with the big poster board. Now, it’s going in my dedication page! I’m also going to choose a bts quote (most likely from the UN speech)
Show him UN speech slowly
You guys know why the 24th of september 2018 is a very important day? it's the day BTS had their speech at the united nations and alSO the day I turned 20 yes they gave me an entire UN speech about self love as a birthday gift that's it that's the tweet
It’s the video that have Billboard, UN speech, order of merit.... a big resume of BTS achievements.
but what if that “every fan art we make about bts becomes real” myth (like black haired bts or presindet namjoon making a speech in the UN) is not any kind of sorcery or coincidence but them going through SNS searching what we want and fantasize about in order to give it to us???
Yeah The VCR is a cute slideshow of BTS and basically showcased BTS at the BBMAs, Namjoon’s speech at the UN and the idol challenge.
BTS has so many achievements this year including 100+ awards won, platinum & golds from RIAA, UN speech, etc. It could be a 24 hr long video but I gotta drop it to 10-15 min lol [ @BTS_twt]
AAA was jos the beginning. I mean MMA gave them a DAESANG for their records last yearThis year alone, BTS topped BB200 TWICE, gave a UN speech, met w the president of S. Korea, on cover of TIME magazine etc—you look DUMB trying to invalidate their Artist of the Year award lmfao
Im just qoute some bts lyrics & rm un speech for my english group assglol & i just hope my partner is an open person bcs she is ikonic so........
Wait but that's basically what BTS have been saying through there songs and the UN speech???? BTS REALLY BE OUT THERE PROVIDING US ADVICE THERAPISTS GIVE WOW https://twitter.com/proxactears/status/1067219067759669249 …

the fanchants, the vcr video with the cultural merit medal and the UN speech and bts trying their best to perform are the only valid thing so far
The UN speech always makes me tear up when I hear it @BTS_twt
UN SPEECH :"""((( @BTS_twt
I presented BTS to my class today, and I started crying at then then they all started applauding. They did as well when the UN speech finished, and they were dancing on IDOL It was beautiful. Show what you truly love to the others, maybe they'll share ur taste? #BTS #BTSARMY
whoever is editing AAA's wiki page better add to BTS popularity award under work: BBMAs, FAKE LOVE, IDOL & UN SPEECH, like they did for last years winner
Just simple mute BTS and you’ll be happy. Listen to UN speech or at least read some book call Magic Shop, 20 000 league under the sea and Omelas. I hope you read literature coz my bois promote some good book from famous intellectual writers

BTS are ambassadors for UN’s UNICF project which focuses on issues effecting youth. Namjoon gave an amazing speech at the UN. Have tissues ready when you watch
meleis cakap we always brag pasal UNICEF when it comes to bts sampai diorang menyampah. i think they just showed theirself yg diorang tak baca pun un speech tu. Sbb kalau betul diorang baca they should show some awareness towards what namjoon said instead of memburukkan org lain
meleis bashing us saying that we only stan BTS for their looks. but upon finding out about BTS's real achievements eg: gave a speech at the UN; they proceed to mocking BTS's looks saying that they're out of place and not 'manly' enough for the position. PICK A NARRATIVE DUMBASS.
Monsta X acknowledged that BTS paved the way for KPOP groups in the US. They say they wouldn’t be able to do the things they‘re doing now if it weren’t for BTS! They also praised Joon’s speech at the UN and called it “powerful.” BTS deserve this recognition, thank you Monsta X!! pic.twitter.com/OujC2zLdGX
it says "bigger year". 4 songs handed to them vs writing 70+ songs, un speech, bbmas, many billboard charts and a sold out tour, biggest sales for a korean artist in nearly two decades... i could go on but i don't seem fit as we all know the truth. stay pressed

so when we had our religion subject, we had our report. for my part, i showed the UN Speech of BTS. i was so happy that my classmates learned a lot from it. my teacher also said that Namjoon is brave enough to humble himself and tell everyone that he has mistakes too. ♡

Sooo.... my cousin was telling me that BTS are overrated. He randomly decided to watch some clips of them. I decided to join him. We watched Namjoon's speech at the UN along with some clips of BTS being dorks and doing/saying iconic things. Now he seems to really like BTS.
ARMY is @BTS_twt @TIME Person Of The Year? Accomplishing much this year; UN speech, breaking billboard records, #EndViolence campaign, toured the world, Seoul's honorary tourism ambassador. Just to name a few. Please vote! https://bit.ly/2PFTAIZ @Vancouver_BTS @Canada_BTS pic.twitter.com/LUcnsT2C4V
Oh god, I'm here after a cultural merit award, many daesangs, numerous awards, a bbma performance, constant charting on BB Artist 100, a UN Assembly speech, sold out Citi Field concert, and countless struggles. You made it...
But actually bangtan is another level. My mom is super ignorant at this kpop things but she know bts cz they give a speech in UN.
um bts collaborating with hyundai.. im not even saying shit anymore like they were always out of the kpop league but after the un speech, everything else and now THIS your favs literally could never
This is how #ARMYs are...filled with hope bcs of #JHope and filled with confidence bcs of #RM... Every time u are sad just see the #RM speech at #UN ... #Fighting
It's especially difficult when just after joon's UN speech, gp realized how serious bts is. This literally is their beginning, hopefully by their next cb the gp will take them & their music srsly :( https://twitter.com/sweetbtstea/status/1067113075956948993 …
Very well!! The students were so impressed by them. I talked about the UN speech a lot and their message and also how the members learn English so it was a great help I think

Sometimes I just randomly remember bts UN speech and get so damn emotional that I start thinking about all the things bts already went thru,what they achieved and how much they mean to me
collab with Charlie Puth, Nicki Minaj, Nell, Steve Aoki, and others, 12 MV/Lyric videos, UN Speech, Bangtan Bombs (on their YT channel) almost every week, Vlive live streams, fansigns, BT21 Merch and collabs w/ Reebok, Converse, Anti Social Club, BTS x Puma, ++
For sure @BTS_twt aka @bts_bighit. You can deny the impact they have had with 2 Billboard 200, the RIAA certification - platinum at that and so much more. Their UN speech impacted the world!

Thoughtful, compassionate, optimistic, open minded, a life long learner and he always remember his roots (physical and musical). Like talking about his hometown, Ilsan, in his UN speech & showing underground hip hop roots in “Timeless” Drunken Tigers collab pic.twitter.com/gKiRD8BMkL
Update: I was able to show them RM's speech at the UN today & explain the Love Myself campaign & the deep resonance @BTS_twt's message has with people around the world. They were impressed & said it was refreshing to see a young group in a position of transformational influence.
Still gets me every dam time. I can watch this all day #BTS #BTSUNSpeech https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
I CRIED IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY WHILE EATING AT THE DINNER TABLE BC WE WATCHED THE UN SPEECH. I NEVER CRY INFRONT OF THEM AND THAT WAS THE FIRST FRICCIN TIME. I COULDNT CONTROL MY EMOTIONS BC HIS SPEECH TOUCHED MY HEART SO DEEP. ;(((
talk about them. TO COMPARE. But you cant compare where you can't compete. BTS have set the bar very high so next time he wanna talk shit AGAIN, maybe he should start looking REAL numbers & REAL achievements. No RIAA, UN speech, KMA, merit medal, no OPINION pic.twitter.com/7DuFJkGNPB
I should start linking un speech video to everyone who asks who is bts
@Corey_Feldman can you please check out this video of BTS this speech is so beautiful. They are the first Korean pop group to ever speak at the UN . I really appreciate it if you checked it out https://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak
IMPORTANT THOUGHT In the next album could BTS put their UN Speech as a skit like they did in Her? Cause I think we need this. pic.twitter.com/kjC9F5HGSw
i just remembered that BTS wERE ON THE COVER OF TIMES MAGAZINE AND NAM FUCKIN JOON DID A SPEECH AT THE UN CONFERENCE WTF THATS ACTUALLY INSANE
I remember I cried when I watched their speech at UN. It reminded of how much I love them and sp grateful that I met them. They helped me continue with everything, they helped me to heal. Got so much love for BTS and ARMY, really.
First daesang Un speech Love yourself tour : they are so happy Fake love performance at AMA : the first time I so bts pic.twitter.com/tRffw8SJnz
I really hope that TIME considers to include this year @BTS_twt as one of 100 people of the year. They have broken language barriers, ambassadors Love Myself #EndViolence Unicef campaign. Spoke at the UN delivering one of the most powerful, inspiring speech of the year. https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1066421245456117760 …
I would have used a collage and included the amazing speech at the UN & all 7 members for their voting pic @TIME one photo can’t define all that is #BTS Here are current stats -adminT pic.twitter.com/7uzDtZmfuH
when joon made his speech on UN and I watched it live, I really cried, it was a beautiful experience and I'll never forget his words :') #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/Psn3qkoP8uw?a BTS RM Speech At The UN REACTION + DISCUSSION | UK ARTISTS REACT TO BTS!
On the other hand, BTS had done a lot for the greater public as well. They've given speech at the UN to tell youth to speak out instead of hiding who they are. They done multiple donations all these time and most are not even discovered by media but by people who received their -
It isn't about charity The only group that topped 2x BB200, hot100, UN speech, Korean Grammy, Grammy interview, Cultural Merit Award, sold 2M from just 1 album (none did it since 1993), Citi Field, RIAA gold & platinum, AMAs, PCAs, BBMA, PURE million sellers So, BTS is THE ONLY
even joined the conversation and said “ Hey! Those guys even gave a speech at the UN” hahahahha! Love that they would humor me and stream BTS on their phones during one of our dinners when DNA cameout. Just like me they are all in their 40’s
what if bts releases songs about armys' stories since joon brought up "speak yourself" in the un speech and he said he wanted to listen to our stories djsjshsb
Hello BTS 7members,my name is Dina. I am very happy to know you -BTS from RM’s speech on October in UN. I like to listen to Your-BTS Musi Because of you-BTS-Suga, I have power to change my life and make me happy by myself .I will grow up with BTS.Thank you so much.
NAMJOON SHOULD MAKE A COVER OF THE SONG KALEIDOSCOPE WORLD BY THE LATE RAPPER FRANCIS M. THE SONG FITS HIM AND SAYS EVERYTHING HE SAIS ON THE UN SPEECH @BTS_twt
For the group that gave us in 2018 alone: -2 albums -2 mixtapes -World Tour -4th Muster -Burn the Stage YT series -Burn The Stage movie -Summer package -Bon Voyage S4 -UN speech ...and SOOO much more, thank you so much #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
Guess who still watches and cries about namjoonies UN speech on a daily basis @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/XsUZ4ZIBKN
Here’s a new rule that us armys (only fandom your apart of) can use “ NO UN SPEECH, NO PROFESSIONALISM” ik I didn’t make this up but if an anti is hating on bts this is a great saying
uhm wow. i just showed my mum namjoon's speech at the un, and she was so?emotional? when it ended. i told her how smart he is and how much bts struggled in the past and i think my mum likes them now
I’m just remembering how deep bts is The un speech showed us what love myself and magic shop truly mean un speech: stars= mistakes and faults Love myself: I don’t make mistakes to be haunted by them Magic shop:I believe in u, what kind of monuments will you make in your life? pic.twitter.com/sf3igbR8nR
hey i'm a fan of tswift. but bts had a speech at the UN supporting pocs and lgbt
I’m using bts’ un speech in my philosophy paper bc it’s important to me! pic.twitter.com/xqkWuKXFrQ
probably their un speech.. that was amazing @BTS_twt
But look, this is what is cool. I have a whole Burn The Stage documentary out there to watch in theaters to explain to people what I see in BTS that is inspiring and unique. I have a UN speech video to show them. I have a TIME magazine cover...
my favourite bts memory so far is the success of their love yourself world tour along with namjoons speech @the UN!! i couldn’t be prouder of them
is he the same people who did speech in un?
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/Psn3qkoP8uw?a BTS RM Speech At The UN REACTION + DISCUSSION | UK ARTISTS REACT TO BTS!
my favorite memory so far would probably be the un speech. it was so powerful and namjoon’s words really made an impact. thanks for the ga! @BTS_twt #MAMAVOTE #BTS
Is this based on namjoon's UN speech? "what excites you and makes your heart beat?" I rest my case. Bow.
people don’t care about him like how they try to make it seem unless he’s doing something big for bts like the un speech then they wanna say they’re proud of him but ignore him on a daily basis
And anak tiri siti nuhaliza quote jugak afoq punya tweet. I tak sure if you already see the tweet. But i think he lowkey stan bts. Only army je yg berani cakap bts are the biggest boyband in the world haha and he knows about UN speech!
Gostei de um vídeo do @YouTube http://youtu.be/Psn3qkoP8uw?a BTS RM Speech At The UN REACTION + DISCUSSION | UK ARTISTS REACT TO BTS!
He lowkey stan bts. Come on only army yg brave ckp bts are the biggest boyband in the world hahaha and he knows about UN speech . Our man are going mainstream
So basically my dad was doubting abt bts and keep asking who da heck bts is dat making me so love them. And guess who explain? My mom legit explain to him who are they and they are a really good influence for youngsters. and keep complementing namjoonie for his UN speech.
Kan! Im not a fan of BTS but at least u gotta give them the credits where it's due. giving a speech at UN is a big feat ok. Apa dia fikir org UN budu2 ka semua lol
okay not like anyone cares but i just feel the need to share this bc it makes me extremely happy. my younger sister always used to tease me for stanning bts not in the sense of mocking but just idk teasing but after i showed her the un speech and showed her the actual lyrics of-
Joonie. She saw his UN speech on her facebook ig. And i keep talking abt how he tells us to love ourselves.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/Psn3qkoP8uw?a BTS RM Speech At The UN REACTION + DISCUSSION | UK ARTISTS REACT TO BTS!
FYI boy, BTS have attended UN for speech about end violence and love yourself.. And now if u think bts is sampah which is trash, then what are you? So sad that you think the boys like that.. But whatever.. Just love yourself sweetie, muach
Well, my mom didn't discriminate or anything. Se was more "you like them, that's great for you but it's not my cup of tea". I forced her to watch @BTS_twt BTS's UN speech. She now listens to N.O of her own free will.I'm happy for you that your dad finally acknowledges #BTS
BTS is the first kpop act to speak at the United Nations (UN). they made a heartwarming speech on how the youth should believe in their own convictions & voices. they also joined together with UNICEF for an anti-violence campaign against children. lansung bukan sampah i think. https://twitter.com/raja_arif_/status/1066294804672208897 …
can anyone link me to the vid of bts full un speech with the subtitle please
Fave BTS memory is them representing the youth in a UN Speech. @BTS_twt

@bts_bighit @BTS_twt you give a speech at UN but so ironic you can't handle your fans The problematic one isn't our SJ but that's your fandom!! Who keep coming to throw hates towards any other Idols & fandoms! Hope you mind to tell & teach the misbehaviour army like this
RT @cestlavie_90: They included Namjoon's UN speech and @BTS_twt no.1 on Billboard 200 in the teaser. As far as I'm concerned, AAA 2018 has many korean celeb attendees compared to other award shows.

My happiest moment with BTS is when I watched them do the live UN speech. It got me so emotional because they are using their influence to help out the youth of the world. pic.twitter.com/YfR2R3Fvvt
I think the most memorable BTS achievement was the UN speech and their first daesang
@BTS_twt Out of all their achievements I feel that the UN Speech was so so important
The UN speech. It was so amazing to see the speech and see how far they have come. Like when they debuted nobody expected they would be touring the world, popular worldwide, and giving a speech at the UN about a campaign that they started.
This year, BTS has released songs and albums, mixtapes, done concerts, done RUN BTS, done lots of great things like giving a speech in UN, and I BE HERE BEING AN UNPRODUCTIVE FATTY LAZY ASS BRAT
Speech at UN. I cried so much that day and I was hella proud. @BTS_twt
He is the same who has given speech at the UN #BTS #방탄소년단 @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/AgGtzcHGt9
UN Speech, I was so proud on how far and big they gotten and to a opportunity like this was something I thought they would never have a chance. It was very unexpected to me.But he gave a beautiful and inspiring speech it made me happy and she'd a little tears u know pic.twitter.com/EB1Cb5WBiN
The UN speech have inspired me a lot @BTS_twt
who would deny bts of their deserving album and artist of the year like seriously even if you're an anti you know deep down they deserve both awards this year. having 2 albums that top both korean and US main chart, global impact such as UN speech, you can't deny it
Thanks for this GA Wish me luck @BTS_twt When bangtan speech at UN pic.twitter.com/8yOdcSP9tp
Since I am somewhat new to the fandom, my favorite memory would be of their UN Speech, it’s very memorable. #MAMAVOTE #BTS⁠ ⁠ @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt definitely the UN speech. They said that no matter who your voice still matters. “No matter who you are, where you from, you skin color, your gender identity: just speak yourself”
rm's un speech pic.twitter.com/QullQaMFFy
Every moment with BTS is the happiest moment. But when they were at the UN doing their UN speech, I've never cried so hard :') I remember staying up at 3 am just waiting.. listening to the rest of the speeches.. even staying to listen after BTS did their speech.. I RMB balling+ pic.twitter.com/eLfLGfZv58
The UN speech and First Daesang of course its make my heart soft :'
Every moment is the happiest moment while stanning bts, but they made me extra proud at the UN speech
The UN speech and when they won their first daesang @BTS_twt
Un speech
The UN SPEECH, WHEN THEIR PERFORM IN BILLBOARD , BTS FIRST DAESENG! WHEN THEY WIN IN BILLBOARD AND WHEN THEY PERFORM LIVE IN A BIG STADIUM WHEN YOONGI FAN CAM REACHED 20M VIEWS WHEN THEY GOT 17M FOLLOWERS IN TWITTER AND 11M FOLLOWERS IN VLIVE (not sure if its 11 mianhe) @BTS_twt
The UN speech @BTS_twt
Im a bit sad bcos haters really really talk bad about bts. You guys should watch bts un speech. There're not racist. They are just talk about just be yourself and mine your own business. Jaga tepi kain sendiri, jangan sebok jaga tepi kain orng.
UN speech and BBMAs bc I remember me and my friend staying up until 3am to watch the livestream. We waited so long and kept texting each other to stay awake. That memory really has a super special place in my heart
Happiest moments with BTS : 1st time BBMAs win last year, This year UN speech
@BTS_twt UN speech. Not only did Joonie absolutely nail it, they were making history. Made me so proud to be ARMY

My mom doesn't like kpop, as in she wouldn't actively listen to it herself, but she looooves BTS esp Namjoon bc of how involved they are w/ UNICEF. She said Namjoon's UN speech made her cry
Kim Namjoon's speech at the UN General assembly in front of Presidents from other countries. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/8b1m3MJuJy
@BTS_twt the most memorable BTS achievement was during the UN General Assembly where Namjoon gave his speech! It was very heartwarming and beautiful to see and it really proves how far they’ve come and that they proved everyone who doubted them wrong pic.twitter.com/hGgj9hOu1e
Ask...do you know BTS? And then show them the UN speech.
Also the un speech im~ pic.twitter.com/CQWpFZtKGr
Namjoon's UN speech still gives me goosebumps at 3am @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations
I got to experience a lot with BTS. I was able to experience 2 concerts that i will never forget.When they won their first daesang it was amazing,i still cry watching it. Or even during the last wings trilogy concert. Even the UN speech.I'll always be grateful to walk this path pic.twitter.com/2AH5Ap4Xjb
Dude im not saying this becoz im an army, but rm's speech at UN was like the only speech that kinda stood out and hit ir heart....even the gp acknowledged it...also i would've never watched the UN assembly if bts wasnt there.....thats the diff

One of their best moments was when they gave a speech at the 'UN', or when they performed at 'AGT', at the 'American Music Awards', or when they presented their performances on US programs such as Ellen Degeneres' program , Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, etc. [ @BTS_twt]
When I was watching them say their speech at the UN, and everything that bts does makes me happy pic.twitter.com/oyc3Jrxgsx
No wonder bts made a speech in the UN, it's all coming together
Hi RM, this year, Because your English Speech in UN ,I know the BTS ,and that time ,I become your fan,and your songs make me keep going and laugh and want to live happily, I will support you RM and BTS. I love you BTS!
He likes BTS lmao I made him watch the fake love vidoe n he liked them. Even looked up Namjoon's speech at un himself and reported to me that they were very good boys. And sometimes he would ask me "any news from fekula ( how are fekula) " He actually said that day in the
hi baby i missed you, i listen to your playlist almost everyday, today i listened to your un speech while going to uni and it almost made me cry in the middle of the street, your words are so powerful, your soul so beautiful and precious i hope youre okay remember i love you
And she was shook. She was like really? And i told her about BTS speech at UN and she looks impressed
Yes https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y This is the full link of RM UN speech RM is the leader of BTS
I WAS JUST ON THE TRAIN AND SAT NEXT TO LOVELIEST OLD WOMAN AND SHE SAW THE VIRAL VIDEO OF JIMIN ON MY TL AND CALLED HIM HANDSOME SO I SPENT 20 MINUTES TALKING ABOUT BTS WITH HER AND SHOWING HER MVS NOW NAMJOON IS HER FAVOURITE AND SHES GONNA CHECK OUT THE UN SPEECH AGSJSKS
The journalists don't want to write about facts, but drama, so they can catch peoples attention.. It's just sad. Since BTS has so much potential, and more interesting things to write about, like the Unicef campaign, or their speech at the UN. Or just the Love Yourself message.
Pardon ??? 1D has never doing a speech in UN ! A campagne love yourself ! A campagne Unicef .... i dont know what To say. BTS is a legend . 1D is not anymore a boys band or a group. pic.twitter.com/h598WqnB9m
Help! Told my mom who works in politics about the recent news w/ j*pan, the fan donations, the UN speech, how political & ground breaking @BTS_twt are & now she wants to hear their music Don’t think she’ll love heavy rap so maybe Spring Day or Fake Love first? Any other recs?
Made my day when my AP Calculus teacher talked about BTS and how she was praising Namjoon and encouring us to watch their UN speech @BTS_twt
what if the next bts album includes “skit: speech at the un”
Don't you date come up to me and say that BTS are flops when IDOL litterally went gold, BURN THE STAGE broke view records across the world, Started a whole campaign about anti bullying and even held a UN speech @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/o5SFVQNJV8
Anyway I did one of my entries for my politics class on BTS’s un speech and I forgot to share with y’all Ps : I’m in college but yes I still need to put little pictures so I took my sweet time ;) (I got 90% thank you @BTS_twt) pic.twitter.com/UpIbY9CorM
2018 was inarguably BTS year. We got 5 RIAA certifications, one of them Platinum, 2 #1 albums on BB + charted 2 FREE solo mixtapes, gave UN speech, Times cover, Grammy Museum & racked up a 24hr YT record.

Us: bts supports feminism, contributed a lot to UNICEF, apologised for their mistakes and learning from them, helped to make political changes, increase Asian representatives in foreign countries, made a speech at the UN etc IDSBStan13: that's not groundbreaking

Ikr I'm also an army and a crazy fangirl of them I get so motivated from their songs and the most important thing their UN speech so if u want to introduce BTS then show them that speech many ppl get motivated from it not only army .....
My no. 1 @BTS_twt MV: SPRING DAY RUN BTS EP: EP24 BTS X ZOMBIE MOST UNFORGETTABLE: UN SPEECH
i was impressed by their choreo! thats what really got me interested in them. and then i learned they had so much more to offer. its amazing. like i officially became an army right before joon gave his UN speech
BTS self produce Thier songs since debut and make socially aware songs like self acceptance and self love with artistic music videos They r not typical boyband which they proved so many times They also topped bb200 twice this yr with non English albums Gave speech at UN etc
@BTS_twt are 7 young versatile men. they have inspired so many and help lit of people come out of depression. They have helped raised over 1.7 million dollar to UNICEF and their speech at UN 2030 Campaign was so inspiring. Thus I would vote for #BTS
If this is regarding BTS, I suggest looking into them a little more. They are amazing people. The leader RM, did a speech to the UN general counsel regarding the concept of Love Yourself and Youth. They have a UNICEF campaign to end violence which so far has raised $1.7M 1/2
Great choice, the UN speech! @BTS_twt
UN speech. END Violence campaign. There are your facts, in the thread which you haven’t read
Anyways UN speech says hello https://twitter.com/imfinej00n/status/1065143506761474048?s=21 …
My no 1 @BTS_twt song - young forever , MV - spring day, RUN BTS EP - Fashion swap , Most unforgettable moment - UN speech love them so much....
BTS r inspiring generations with Thier songs They self produce their songs with has lots of socially aware msgs so u can't say their music is shit BTS gave speech at UN Topped billboard 200 twice this yr with 2 Korean albums Sold out world tour Broke 1D movie record etc

Yes - and I realized when watching the Bangtan Bomb about the UN speech that RM was practicing right after the Hamilton concert BEFORE they even left the venue! I was exhausted watching the concert! They do so much and squeeze work in everywhere they can! @BTS_twt
No honey they’re only famous because of their message etc.They motivate us and teach us to love ourselves. To quote our talented leader “true love starts with loving myself” -Kim Namjoon. I’m tryna remember did your leader say speech at the UN talking about youth etc. pic.twitter.com/LKY79Hy6Zy

Act nice to us or we will chart BTS speech at the UN and kick your faves's comeback out of the local and WW charts

I got it! I agree! I have a feeling they don't know what actual rest is anymore. Look at RM he says he felt like he hasn't done much this week when it flat out write two albums, make his own, UN speech and etc.

Everything I've witnessed @BTS_twt accomplish in 2018 makes me proud to be their fan. Two #1 albums in four months, sold out world tour, UN speech, TIME Magazine cover, Order of Cultural Merit... #BTS has really written their own fairy tale and earned the right to be living it.
Come back when your faves give a speech at the UN
I'M LISTENING TO JOON'S SPEECH AT THE UN AND I'M ONCE AGAIN EXTREMELY MOVED BY HIS WORDS :( @BTS_twt

Remember the guy who I had lectured because he told me I was wasting my time on bts? He did apologise later & I had sent him the link of epiphany. Today he asked me the links of more such meaningful songs of bts. He even watched the video of joon's speech at the UN & was inspired
@BTS_twt I work for a large company called Freeman Health System. Every day they email employee’s this Daily lineup with event reminders and such. At the very top they include a quote. I submitted a quote from RM’s UN speech and it got chosen!!! #speakyourselfpic.twitter.com/KYcsDGlIwQ
I love how my mom went from judging me about my love for @BTS_twt to defending me when others judge me for it. She'll really stand there and talk about their message of self love and bring up the UN speech. Ily mom
And about the UN speech, well congrats for giving a speech at the age 17 for wang, that’s cool But actually, i didnt feel that excited when bts did theirs Yeah it was cool & joon was super nervous but.. that was it
BTS did in 2018: Hope World, LY Tear, BBMAS, BTS Run, BTS Festa, Bon Voyange Season 3, LY Answer, UN Speech, Mono, Japanese Album & Airplane pt.2 MV, WIOM, Drunken Tiger collab, World Tour, korean Awards, Clothing/makeup Collabs etc And namjoon still think he hasnt done anything pic.twitter.com/29eH2abmBq
What if BTS's next project is 'Speak Yourself' & is also composed of 3 albums where each will celebrate diversity in: 1. race/ethnicity 2. skin color/physical appearance in general 3. gender identity [In reference to Namjoon's speech in UN.]
we talked about bts and mainly kim namjoon during class today for their UN speech and then my classmate suddenly came up w homophobic remarks
im so content omg my parents usually get annoyed whenever i talk ab bts and when i mentioned that i saw burn the stage today my dad was willing to watch intro to bts vids + joons un speech n he was so :( inspired :( and happi that i look up to such influential men and im SO pic.twitter.com/YA8eER4Zsb
I always tried to convince my mom that bts taught me a lot including how to accept all the creations in this world. I also like, print namjoon's UN speech to give it to her so she can be alert that i love them :(((
ok someone help how should i do thos assembly fpr self love like imma use bts' un speech and lyrics from their songs but what else can i do to make it better?
A fucking kpop group(aka those cuties @BTS_twt ) can write a much better and inspiring speech than Melania Trump can for the UN https://twitter.com/real_farmacist/status/1063960477817032705 …
Nice the lecturer is talking about BTS UN speech
publicly saying how talented they are. They don’t have the media up their asses & the UN didn’t invite for a speech because other groups “paved the way.” @BTS_twt has achieved what they’ve achieved through their own hard work. Yes, they’re handsome and yes they’re funny too, but
BTS RM’s UN speech used in textbooks, exams worldwide http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20181106000673 …
How the fuck are u saying your faves outsold bts in anything. where’s your cultural merit award? your sold out concert in a stadium in the US. what about top album on the billboard twice in one year. speech at the un? how bout aoty two years in a row? do u need me to keep going?
yeah but they never worked with the Japanese albuns before... this time it was like a trilogy totally different: a Japanese 'face yourself' album, amidst a Korean 'love yourself' era, finishing up with a UN 'speak yourself' speech...
Namjoon's speech in UN. Then, Kookie sang "If you" in the king of masked singer sealed the deal.
ARMYS, HEAR ME!! This Malaysian army got an "A" for her english exam's result.. She wrote about fake love's lyrics and RM's speech in UN. Proud of her! @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @BigHitEnt #BTS #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/mcHGJHOhrA
my family were really judgy whilst watching bts on graham norton saying all kind of no jam stuff "they all look the same", but when graham mentioned their time magazine cover and the UN speech, they shut up real quick, the effect tho pic.twitter.com/z66oAtx7Dn
the only thing stopping my dad from accepting bts is bc they havent sunat yet like is that what it takes... really? not even a UN speech???
The speech at the UN or their first daesang
I'm now re writing namjoon's UN speech and planned to write all BTS' lyrics KSJKSKS
It makes me sad when people r trying to ruin the true essence of @BTS_twt ideology in this generation & present time.They mean no harm.They are just trying to make people happy &inspired. I still believe 101% on Namjoon's speech at the UN and all the other speeches that he did. https://twitter.com/choi_bts2/status/1064031706733105152 …
this is so cute, v armys are sharing their stories and commenting on his post, as they are finally taken seriously. my dad wrote about rm’s speech(it’s his bias btw), bts at un and the love yourself series.
Lmao BTS legend. There i said it aGAIN. Your opinion?? Invalid. They stay winning. And guess what they make a speech in the UN, legend only. Your favs?? Can’t relate. Stay pressed honey. https://twitter.com/whilehazqsleep/status/1064103846903873536 …
Good morning #BTSArmy Our final #QuoteOfTheDay from the UN speech! Hope you enjoyed this quick ride full of inspiring thoughts and quotes #LoveYourself Alisa #BTSonRadioUK #BT21xASSC #BTSxMAMA #MAMAVote #BTS #BT21장패드 #BURN_THE_STAGEpic.twitter.com/FEc3dxWZ6W
Oh and don’t forget the Speech at the UN Headquarters given by RM, BTS on Generation Unlimited in front of World Leaders and Secretaries https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
who told you that loving bts and their message is synonymous to loving and supporting all of the above that you mentioned about korea? look up RM's UN speech.. look up how bts has in every song spoken about topics and issues made taboo for the kpop industry
BTS despite being bigger than kpop and with 2 #1 bb200 in their bag, 3 RIAA gold cert, a UN speech, and grammy museum interview still think that their popularity is like that of a normal idol group,,,
Joon's speech at the UN really made me want to give my entire world to bts because like,, they made me realize i have a voice this entire time and it's okay to speak myself, i just decided i want to be with them till the end, they've become so precious to me
ARMY: hunting LY album, hunting LY ticket, stucked increasing BTS chart, crying of BTS UN SPEECH, streaming BTS youtube red, streaming idol, streaming mono, chart voting, etc. Me: i absolutely did something RM: i havrn't done anything at all Me: WHOM FOR THAT ALL THINGS I DID? pic.twitter.com/seewF7DrAF
so this lady(56 yo) is conducting team building workshop for our company, and she mentions BTS and RM's UN speech. she asked if anyone in the room likes BTS. and she signed my book with "always #LoveYourself " what a world im living inpic.twitter.com/BQcHx5IJk2
moments I've felt most proud of @BTS_twt in 2018 so far: - billboard debut of FL perf and winning top social artist again - UN speech - receiving their cultural merit awards
The UN speech
I want to ask my principal if there could be an assembly on self love and positive stuff like that and include joonie's UN speech and BTS' positive messages in their music but im a pussy-
I was asked to write words of gratitude for my art project. So I decided to do Namjoons UN Speech. BTS inspires me in so many ways, I am so thankful to have came across BTS. They make me so happy and I love them so much!! pic.twitter.com/F2LwOc0Pzo
joon literally referred to himself as an idol in his UN speech.. he said to not look down on idols before too lmao.. they sound just like bfree who made fun of bts for being idols
The video you're watching rn is he's talking, giving a speech inside the UN hall. His name is RM. He's a rapper but also can sing. Here's his newest song 'Forever Rain' from his mixtape so yeah stan BTS, the next generation's leader https://youtu.be/Cvb76hBX_Oc
Omg.... for the first time ever, mom and dad accept me as an army ㅠㅜ RM's UN speech impressed my dad to no end and moms been finally wowed Blasting bangtan @BTS_twt to celebrate ! ㅠㅜ
Never thought to hear the day that my family would be talking and asking for info about my boys My mom even ask me why Joons UN speech wasn't in the movie, I explained why, she turns to me and says they better come with a BTStage 2 with that in it @BTS_twt #BurnTheStageTheMoviepic.twitter.com/pfBEkt0hB4
my mom kept on comparing harry styles to bts and making xenophobic remarks so i told her "at least bts achieved success without white privilege, broke language barriers and were INVITED to make a speech about self love on the UN" and now im grounded but at least i proved my point
Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/kmVOdkVRSlY?a BTS Speech at the 73rd UN General Assembly Love yourself, speak yourself
Yoongi’s name was translated to Yunki because that’s how u say it I think idk, his name on his badge at the UN speech was Yunki so idk and probably same for RM
I have my own solution sis. Every time they talk shit about bts I drop namjoon's UN speech on their mentions and yeah they went silent or paling2 bising pun "eh tetiba" and terus xcakap apa dah uwu
We have never waste anything on these boys sorry not sorry they are the world's next generation leader for your information and successfully spread their meaningful speech on UN a few months ago so yeah stan BTS https://twitter.com/BBC/status/1044602937039867907?s=19 …
So far the gp ppl around me have only said good things about bts to me, some have barely learned about the un speech
i love it when namjoon gave that un speech. it was such a great opportunity for them and joon was amazing at delivering his speech im so proud of them @BTS_twt
[BTS x Denmark] #BTSdk #BTSxBerlingske @BTS_twt was mentioned again today in @berlingske! Journalist @maisenjor wrote a feature about the kpop store in Copenhagen & we're so happy she mentions BTS and also their amazing speech at the UN. pic.twitter.com/Wi2WTXa8ah
Do I care about your gender, human? Anyways stan bts who awares about mental illness and gave a good speech on UN about #SpeakYourself and #ENDviolencehttps://twitter.com/BBC/status/1044602937039867907?s=19 …
Im still remember the Leader of BTS speech on UN "No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity... Just speak yourself" - Kim Namjoon They're really opened and sincerely want to help people out there
superwoman decided to take a break from youtube bc she wants to focus on her mental health, says "loving yourself is a priority", all after meeting bts and hearing namjoon's un speech. coincidence? i think not pic.twitter.com/JkFALZneTn
YES SHE DID. She was kinda inspired when i sent her rm's speech on UN and she liked them because she said they have that charisma when they're performing. And i'm hoping soon, i'll turn her into an army lol
Namjoon at 24, giving speech at the UN, produced songs for their album, released his 2nd mixtape, have world tour ongoing, winning countless awards and still thinking he have done nothing. Me at 23, stan @BTS_twt 24/7 and jobless. what makes me then? why i feel so small?
I'm writing to you regarding RM speech at the UN. He wrote the speech by himself. There's even a behind the scene video showing how long it took him to get his speech done in which he talked about his childhood story and BTS' message.Please say to everyone"I'm sorry"
I'm really shocked at the thoughtlessness, how dense do you have to be to go around doing this shit literally right after that UN speech?! Did none of them go "uhh manager, u might not wanna do that??" BTS: Korean band's managers apologise over Nazi photos https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/14/bts-korean-bands-managers-apologise-over-nazi-photos?CMP=share_btn_tw …
Wow! Thanks for taking the time to write this article, its great! I was really impressed with your level of research, thanks for mentioning their meaningful lyrics and the UN speech! @BTS_twt ~Gem pic.twitter.com/6P2jaQn6Iv
How bout u beat BTS' 2 #1 albums on Billboard, KMA Musician of the Year, Order of Merit medals, Top 10 song in Hot 100. 89 number 1s on itunes (mono), 100 weeks #1 on Social 50, UN speech, The Grammy Museum Interview and Time Magazine cover first?
this is funny but the video that got me hooked to bts is their un speech and the jimmy fallon interview (where they performed idol + i’m fine after). then watching the mv for young forever makes me tear up every. single. time.
@web_goody I'm writing to you regarding RM speech at the UN. He wrote the speech by himself. There's even a behind the scene video showing how long it took him to get his speech done in which he talked about his childhood story and BTS' message.Please say to everyone"I'm sorry"

Well bts did deliver a speech at the UN. Anda bagaimana? https://twitter.com/nubhankhairii/status/1063280053088247808 …
Update: She likes Namjoon so much. She can’t shut up about how good he is — his rapping style, his UN speech, his smile. AH! I never thought my sister is an intellectual. JOON DID THAT. “I am so proud of your @BTS_twt boys and their humble beginning”
Lol the UN guy damn we really made an impact with the bts un speech huh I’m proud
To #ARMY in the world Today, Takahashi Katsumi, a Japanese actor, said “RM’s speech in UN was written by the other writer. ” in Goody, a news product. We want he and Goody to apologize and withdraw the comment. PLEASE REPLY TO @web_goody OR TWEET WITH #グッディ #BTS
So lemme get this straight: - Hope World - BBMAs - Festa - Tear - Face Yourself - Answer - Summer package - World tour - Bon Voyage s3 - UN speech - mono - President in Paris - 5+ (??) Collabs - MGA & 60+ (??) awards @BTS_twt did that & the year isn't over yet. #BTS #MAMAVOTEpic.twitter.com/6gMzTrlxeL
they’re still hooked on those achievements? weren’t those months/a year ago? have they heard of the grammy interview? time magazine? UN speech? etc. or do they not even know what importance those achievements have? :’c @BTS_twt
The others came because they had sat there and talked/wrote about that speech together but just translated it all in English for everyone else at the UN to understand....
she thinks bts is amazing with everything they stand for and she said she saw the un speech and was touched by it oOF she said she was glad that i have a group to make me super happy and she loves when groups appreciate their fans like bts NDJDJJSJDJD
I'll say it again. THEIR UN SPEECH. pic.twitter.com/VmcC4c3uCx
30. Moment when you were the most proud: Speech at the UN I was just so proud to say “yes, those are bts. They’re more than a boy band. They’re trying to make a difference and help other kids like me out” pic.twitter.com/BjpDFmtzGZ
So yall collectively ignore that bts achieved 2 #1 critically acclaimed album, interviewed by Grammy museum, a speech at the UN for generation unlimited (its ambassadors), got the order of Cultural Merit Award etc. things no korean group has ever achieved or comes close to.. okay
in bts Yoongi said that they reached a point when they should start feeling burned out & he said that 1 year ago...2018 has been the year when they gave a speech at UN, had a cb at the BBMAs, were submitted for Grammys,were called Next Generation Leaders,performed at CitiField i- pic.twitter.com/8Tf5RwEMvy
its funny that RM did mention his actual name, stage name and also his city ilsan before beginning his speech and also in the end and the people who saw the UN speech don't know his name??
My BF ( local) agreed to go watch Burn the Stage with me and afterwards he was inspired by BTS's journey and said it motivated him to keep working hard for what he wants. He said the boys would have had no idea that 5 years later, they'd go on to make a speech at the UN
10 reasons Kim Namjoon deserves all the love in the world: 1. His message of self love 2. His politness and kidness towards all people 3. His humility in front of success 4. His speech in the UN 5. The depth and the comfort he brings with his lyrics @BTS_twt #BTS #RMpic.twitter.com/PwgQijqQXV
On September 24th, 2018 BTS got the honour to give a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York as voices for the youth. In their speech they encouraged youths to be themselves, keep dreaming and "speak themselves". Watch the full speech here: https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y pic.twitter.com/9exKVUf9Dj
watching the bts episode of the UN assembly speech again just reminds me how incredible they truly are for the way they think and sharing it with us so publically but also especially namjoon for being so intelligent and brave in representing the seven of them
Meet the real kings giving speech at UN. Bigbang can't relate pic.twitter.com/cZCJNtllXW
BTS are really powerful!!it's night time Here and suddenly there was a powercut. and the electricity went off. I was watching the video of Namjoon's speech at the UN and as soon as he finished his speech the electricity came back!BTS power prevails @BTS_twt
Lately, a lot of people around me are getting curious about BTS and since they know I'm a fan they come to me first asking what is all about. I tell them about the members, their music, lyrics and talent. About their message of self love, social awareness, UNICEF, UN speech +
also bts held plenty of important interviews and even had a speech at the UN
It wasn’t after the speech at the un that fans all over the world joined. We are at it since forever

Some of the students of course know they r BTS. The rest was just confused OK. But, here I'm gonna share what happened this week. Alajslsbd. It's "SPEAK YOURSELF" Session because I eventually picked Namjoon's speech at UN video. The speech is amazing. pic.twitter.com/U4pTyQjgNT
today, korean culture center of the philippines held some korean caravan in our school. i’m so happy that they HIGHKEY promoted the UN general assembly speech of namjoon and the influence of @BTS_twt, not only just an idol BUT as global ambassadors pic.twitter.com/rwBNwGd4j4
In the #RMspeech #BehindTheScenes video, you can see how nervous #BTS is incl. #RM because no Korean Pop group have ever done this before. RM drafts the speech, practice without sleep, and memorized the script by the time he reached UN. What an effort! https://youtu.be/OHk1OXseVPY
Namjoon: amazing work with BTS, amazing solo work, amazing speech at UN, amazing collab etc. etc. No jams: BUT NAMJOON.............doesn't know how to cut onions
Well that day we had this assembly on this kindness and anti-bullying week in school and Namjoon’s speech in the UN was played for the whole school to watch it KIM NAMJOON our president, the power of BTS, so proud to be an army pic.twitter.com/W7LCgVq8Wl
I used Namjoon's @UN speech as part of my presentation on the topic - 'Caste, Gender and Identity' yesterday only and it was a hit! #MAMAVOTE #BTS
Now you came for Joonie's un speech Wow you can't stay still #bts #RM #joonie #kimnamjoon #namjoon
Anyone: Me: haha yeah so glad you asked but yes Namjoon did give a speech at the UN in a non-native language, he did send his lyrics to a professor for approval, he does have dimples, he does qualify as a literal genius, #MAMAVOTE #BTS pic.twitter.com/TQB7h1rWfH
There are like 1253642 kpop predictions accounts on twt & none of them predicted BTS' phenomenal growth in 2018. No predictions about KMA, BB200, UN speech, etc.. The only things they are excited to predict are some grp X overthrowing BTS in year Y.
there's a korean caravan event at my school and we're watching joon's speech at the UN assembly and i am so damn proud of our boys and how far they've come i love them so much i hope they continue to influence the world in such a positive way. i'm proud of you @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/aeBJlbjhGy
funny seeing other people has different interpretation of what I said I understand what the video was about. I just found it's weird that the interviewer knows v and jk but not RM even tho RM is quite famous among general public because of his UN speech
Yes the interviewer that knows V and Jungkook. The volleyball player knows RM because of his speech at UN but she doesn't know his name.
My sister just sent me this. They are watching the UN speech of @BTS_twt in her school #BTS Proud pic.twitter.com/WOroiIFun5
imagine having to stoop so low as to falsely accuse RM of copying his UN speech from some ‘other writer’ when in actual fact, his intellectual self wrote it all on his own. smh. you can try to bring bts down all u want, but it just shows how much they’re above u #グッディ
Brave of them to tweet this when they consistently mock bts’ charity work, the end violence campaign, disregard the charity work armys do and even make fun of namjoons UN speech
This reminds me of the message behind Joon's UN speech: #SpeakYourself Credit: Erin Hanson #BTSpoemsuntold @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/jnK9W5TzAT
So I watched the UN Speech with my Social Worker and I showed her Answer: Love Myself and she told me the message they have is amazing and encouraging. @BTS_twt please know you’re helping those with Mental Health issues, bc at the most crucial moment in my life you were there
What's with this continuous attempt to drag BTS down? Why would someone, out of nothing, say that RM didn't write the UN speech??
I even talked about their UN speech and their comforting lyrics we need to make everyone stan BTS
What I'd do if I got the chance to see #BurnTheStageTheMovie at the cinema. Get a group of friends and engage them in conversation bout how amazing @BTS_twt is & how I loved their UN speech. Id get super loud and passionate whenever a muggle passes by cause everyone eavesdrops
That bts has that one person who even talked at UN speech https://twitter.com/taestpaper/status/1062951341637550081 …

RM is one of the best lyricists in the music industry. His UN speech literally was about his own life and contained many of his own lyrics from BTS' songs. He wrote the UN speech. Period. Retract your statement and apologize in public. This is defamation. @web_goody #グッディ

Yes I spoke in length about the BTS UN speech for a politic Discussion board.
Bbmas s-speech? I only know UN speech. Oof.
i used RMs UN speech's issues in my english exam And also i had to write an article about bullying and other related things to it ..so i wrote what all i see armys and BTS talking about. And my teacher liked it so much that i was the only one who got full in my article writing
Wait wait wait How is RM's UN Speech written by someone else when most of what he said was his own story ??? As a kid, in Ilsan ?? And how he became part of BTS ?? WTF is going on with these rumours ??
And there is also a thing in our class that everyday I have to write 2 new words on class board....and mostly I use words related to BTS or their song names like euphoria, serendipity,stigma and many more... And I have also used lines from Namjoon's UN speech in many debates....
I have used many many news of BTS in our school's morning assembly ...in GK quiz... I have asked many questions to our school's student in assembly like the Times magazine , most handsome man, UN speech and many more things....
guess who's gonna include bts un speech on her magazine project hhh
I always use their lyrics in my English essays I quoted from Namjoon's UN speech in my most recent one and got the first prize among 20 other participants @BTS_twt #MAMAVote #BTS
Name one group other than BTS who has a movie, had a speech infront of the UN leaders, performed at GMA, AGT+ had an intimate interview for Grammy museums, guest at Tonight Show (Jimmy Fallon), an Order of Cultural Merit Awardee and has won 40+ trophies
Finally in my hobby part...I talked about BTS and kpop music..I talked about how we armys interact,how we achieve our goals..and I didn't forget about the un speech also... basically the interview was all about our boys..and they are actually impressed about that..
Oh yes . I wrote about BTS’ UN Speech for my FC blog project.
i cut my hair short to give them to an organization that makes wigs for women with cancer! I want thank @BTS_twt bc they inspired me to do this after the speech in UN and the love yourself series! This is my"speakyourself" I am Sophia and i want to make others happy! pic.twitter.com/LHSEuKoLf3
A main reason why i haven't been on twt for two days now like Until this tweet popped up in my notification. Like everyone is so much exited. Even my nonkpoper friends wanna see this movie cuz they liked bts after the UN speech and things that way. They wanna know them more. But pic.twitter.com/qOjcgTKIc0
How pathetic. They think RM's speech was so great that someone else must have written that for him? WOW. His UN speech was great, but compare to his beautiful thoughts he always shares with fans all the time, it seems the UN speech was rather simpler to me. @BTS_twt
#グッディ BTS RM We ask @web_goody to apologize and withdraw the statement regarding RM's UN speech. Do not tarnish a good cause for your personal agenda so we kindly ask you to retract your comment. Thank you.
mess with ARMYs before mess with BTS & especially Kim Namjoon and his UN Speech you *** ** *******
#グッディ Takahashi Katsumi said that RM speech in UN was written by other person. No. This speech was done by BTS members, especially RM. You tried to get some clout by fake news, so here we are. We want your sincere apology to RM and BTS. @web_goody
We're working with UN, should I ask if we can watch bts' speech?
This! I've already gotten two colleagues to agree to watch Burn The Stage with me. They also have some context about the boys, we've discussed their UN speech & they've even heard a couple of songs. We meaningful local promo @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/taexty/status/1062938521843814400 …
omg, i thought im the only one! i've been trying to recall when did he start exuding this daddy vibes. was it un speech or cultural merit award? he's just..different now..and i looove it.
My sister started looking for @BTS_twt songs (and videos) after Namjoon’s UN speech and my constant “Ahh~ Jungkookie~” on our family gc. Update: She created a playlist for their songs and she’s definitely inlove with Spring day. QUEEN WBK. pic.twitter.com/rxnqC3wDuv
I found a good excuse to quote @BTS_twt Joonie's UN speech into my paper. Pied Piper is shooketh!!
BTS can do a speech in UN was decided by UN and they invited BTS to do that, and it is base on the trust relationship exists between those two parties. So when you criticize BTS speech it means you criticize UN at the same time.
giiirl, my reply was like almost 2 years ago aksjsjs anyway yeah, its almost the end of 2018 and bts proved a lot to us especially through joon's speech at the UN. Theyre woke kings

People need to be mature and not drag Ikon. Agreed. But u dont need to drag bts who literlly support LGBT. From books, to songs, to how they dress to being gender neutral in their language. I mean have you heard Namjoon speech at the UN About gender identity.
LMAOOOOO. my boys educated themselves and that was 3 years ago. BTS are outta here giving a speech in UN inculding gender identity, writing songs which are gender neutral and many more. Meanwhile your faves did it in 2017 with no apologies. https://twitter.com/SevenK7_7/status/1062923948978044928 …
what?? everyone knows @BTS_twt #RM wrote the UN speech, bc he's been saying that same msg for yrs & those r even in the lyrics over the yrs.. then, this person saying the speech was written by a writer?? im just losing hope for the media thesedays pic.twitter.com/zs7G8TsQh4
#グッディ I dont know who gave u the right to be this ignorant and disrespectful to a man who gave a life changing speech at the UN about himself that HE WROTE. Deeply apologize to RM of BTS because thats inhumane and disgusting to insult someones hard work like that @web_goody
I went to the subway only to see the exhibition (2nd pic is Namjoon's UN speech in spanish) @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/zd7I5UGXau
and let’s not forget the infamous UN speech where Namjoon literally says “no matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself” “NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE” BTS are supportive of EVERYBODY
yall using 2013-2014 problematic bts shit to justify some of your faves behavior stinks.. 1. bangtan has apologized countless times, 2. youtube is free go watch joon’s speech at the UN, 3. update your receipts because them shits ancient.... pic.twitter.com/9hJu8xSwda

We are kindly asking for an apology for the false statements made against BTS RM. There is ample evidence that it was he, himself that drafted the speech given at the UN & was only proofread by the company. Please do not discredit his hard work and passionate efforts. #グッディ
BTS quotes and messages to armys, It’s beautiful. And in the last picture is the UN speech
@web_goody Huh. Not sure how you can know if someone else wrote RM’s UN speech—SINCE IT SHOWS RM WRITING IT IN A VIDEO—but go off I guess. @BTS_twt
This is what Japanese actor Katsumi Takahashi said on a TV show called @web_goody. He said about a speech written by the BTS leader RM himself, "UN...That was written by another writer, wasn't it? “ #BTS #防弾少年団 #BTSARMY #BTSinTokyoDome #TogetherWithBTShttps://twitter.com/bts_megu613/status/1062762950170095616 …
Kim Namjoon aka RM of BTS, he wrote his own UN speech. That's why he included his childhood story in it. Stop embarrassing yourself #グッディ
Paknil acknowledged RM's speech for UN..and Hani loves BTS too
So this article is spreading even more lies by saying joonie didn’t write the UN speech we are politely requesting an apology and withdrawal of this false statement from them using #グッディ @web_goody @web_goody #グッディ @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xjMuegt7nT

do y’all want to hear about my day? I taught my capstone group the dance to likey and then my teacher let me talk about bts/kpop (mostly bts) for 15 minutes and show our class the mic drop mv + the un speech and then we talked abt globalization and social media. whew.
BTS’ RM’s words at the UN speech was ONLY proofread by Big Hit. Every part of that speech was from Namjoon’s heart and life experiences therfore it’s very ignorant and disrespectful to say it was not his words. Please check your facts and I expected better... #グッディ
y’all what if bts’ next album really is speak yourself and in it they release “skit: un assembly speech” yO—
Excuse me Mr. Katsumi, but how can you 'surely' say that RM's (member of BTS) UN speech was written by someone else? Were you present there? It's not accurate for a 57 year old to spread false infos about a young boy. #グッディ @web_goody
Y’all Japanese media are saying RM UN speech wasnt written by him. can they FVCKING leave BTS alone? Oh my god they keep spreading false info. Iam so done. https://twitter.com/bts_megu613/status/1062762950170095616 …

What kind of musty a$$balls do you have to have to accuse Namjoon of NOT writing his UN speech?! How dare anyone make such preposterous claims, especially w/o any proof to back them up. I hope karma hits everyone slandering @BTS_twt 100-fold. Y'all deserve it!
I don't understand where this slander is coming from, but Kim Namjoon, RM, of @BTS_twt is not one to let others write HIS story for him. He is a passionate man, who wrote a passionate UN speech. Please, apologize for making such egregious, false accusations. #グッディ @web_goody

Japanese actor, said “RM’s speech in UN was written by the other writer. ” RM's speech about his life. He born at ilsan. So Japanese actor a idiot.
Please apologize to Mr. Kim Namjoon for implying he's a hypocrite. He personally took the time to write his UN speech and share his own personal story to the world with a good message. Do not take that away from him with your false accusations. @BTS_twt @web_goody #グッディ

We demand a proper apology & to withdraw the comment made from Takahashi Katsumi & @web_goody for an uncalled, misleading & false comment towards RM a member of BTS. There's proper video proof documenting BTS & RM discussing the UN speech & practising it. #グッディ
#グッディ If he had balls to accused RM speech in UN was written by other people, then give us any PROOF! @web_goody We need an apology for Kim Namjoon/ RM from BTS
To whom it may concern, Please retract what Mr. Katsumi said about RM's UN speech. RM of BTS pour all his heart in writing that speech. His UN speech wasn't written by a writer, RM himself write his UN Speech. Also, I am requesting for Mr. Katsumi to apologize to RM. Thank you. https://twitter.com/web_goody/status/1062542622852411392 …
Is this how you want to be exposed to the general public? For falsely accusing someone of not writing their own speech for the UN as a UNICEF ambassador? Time and time again people have targeted BTS but time and time again we will rise above people like you. pic.twitter.com/3fBB9eQiDp
Fans of BTS around the world demand an apology for the lies being spread concerning RM's UN speech as an ambassador for UNICEF. Such unfounded accusations that are clearly contradicted by proven facts will not be taken lightly by us or BigHit Entertainment. @BigHitEnt @bts_twt
they try everything to make their name dirty, but we won't stay silent. @web_goody apologize to BTS RM, you don't even know how much work he put on his speech in UN. #グッディ
So recently @web_goody was accusing that @BTS_twt 's UN speech was writed by some else, in Japan television. I hope you have proof or any research for that to make that announcement.

#グッディ Such a shame of a country. You guys accuse BTS for many false news, now you say RM didn't write the UN speech. Some Japanese are trying drag BTS just because they are a Korean group and they are now famous all over the world. You know how stupid you are @web_goodypic.twitter.com/cmtIgcvlJB
#グッディ What is wrong with some Japanese ? You are so pathetic when you try to drag BTS. How can you say that UN speech does not written by RM. @web_goody apology for this.pic.twitter.com/RvKJQuZ4mw
Such shame that people with years of career on the industry business don't know how harmful a statement could be when it's not based on solid proof and biased opinions. Apologize to RM of BTS for slanderous sayings by @web_goody about his speech at the UN!!! #グッディ

RM UN speech?? I mean let yoongless speak himself
I would really love someone who already follows BTS way before the UN speech ;)
Today is apparently kindness day, and all I can think about is Namjoon’s speech from the UN and I’m not sure why. #KimNamjoon @BTS_twt
Bts is on the dutch news bc of JM Figures they come on the news with this and not with their speech at the UN
Y'alls I included namjoon's UN speech in both my English and Chinese essays, I promoted BTS to the marker but I gotta say thank you namjoon for helping me with my essay hhhh i love you @BTS_twt #SPM2018
Some of y'all claiming to be army are wrong for this and you KNOW youre wrong. BTS did not prosper and make that speech at the UN for y'all petty fucks of the fanbase to completely ignore their campaign. Go vote and stream. Support, don't drag. #ENDviolance #BTS https://twitter.com/ch3ei/status/1062078132008546304 …

should young people be trusted in making their own decisions. Writes a whole paragraph of bts lyrics+ un speech
It’s really something fishy if BTS didn’t win this category, just looked at their whole achievement this year. International awards winning, Sold out world tour, Album sales, UN speech etc even Mr.President recognize their achievement.
Tell me I’m not the only one who wrote about BTS lyrics + UN speech for paper 1 english ques 4 #SPM2018 may the power of bangtan give me an A+

On 8/24 BTS dropped Love Yourself Answer, on 9/24 BTS gave their speech at the UN Headquarters, on 10/24 BTS was awarded the order of cultural merit medal, I wonder what will happen on 11/24, this is no coincidence
SO MY SPANISH TEACHER SAID WE COULD WRITE ABOUT ANY TOPIC SO A BESTIE OF MINE RECOMMENDED TO DO BTS AND THE UN SPEECH GUESS WHO’S WRITING ABOUT THAT

I really wonder if any of the army’s realize that namjoon’s speech for the un was literally about ending violence. Yet here we are, trashing a group off of a video that could be revived differently by different people. I’m honestly so so disappointed, and I bet BTS is too.
BTS with two #1 in bb200, a cultural merit award (the highest one), a top 10 hot 100 song, UN speech, sold out tour that includes Europe, performed for KR-FR diplomatic relations, global time magazine cover appearance and article, Grammy museum interview what else did i miss
@BTS_twt gave a speech at the UN about acceptance and loving yourself and they were made fun of and laughed at, most media didn't cover it but the moment BTS slipped everyone jumps on them like a pack of wolves. #TogetherWithBTS
plese never forget namjoon's speech at the un "no matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself, find your name, find your voice by speaking yourself" #TogetherWithBTS #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nNbil9jmZK

Deliver positive affects to the world and ppl so they can LOVE THEMSELVES as BTS have shared the speech over UN meeting in September, 2018. We are living in a place with so many different ppl, and let’s have understandings and forgiveness so ppl and improve from their past
Instead of hating momoland on not-clear-if-they-laugh-on-jimin-crack-voice, toxic armys who send death threat should focusing on what message bts want to deliver in their music and UN speech. That way, toxic armys can be reduced and the world can be better.
Falsely trained army bts is on a tour and made a UN speech about loving yourself and loving others but here y’all are attacking groups. Pre-Mainstream BTS, bts ( and I hate this wording) was nothing compared to how they are now. The BIG 3 (JYP, SM,YG) are the
Its because Jimin is part of BTS who is well known and famous worldwide and they even give speech in UN so don't expect that those people will didn't make a way to drag your fave name. So I hope that you Army's didn't drag JH into your problem b-cause he didnt have nothing to do

I met her last weekend and she told me she noticed the increase of media coverage BTS had recently (she's not a Kpop fan) + UN speech. We're lucky we have supportive friends

The main problem is that BTS promotes peace. Weren't your fandom promotes #endviolence? The difference is that BTS made a speech in UN yet still wore a shirt that promotes death and war.
I've seen other reports of mml being disrespectful and I honestly was "maybe it's a misunderstanding" tho some are really questionable. Then this..and I'm like NOPE, NOT OUR BOYS. Y'know how ppl come with "bts made HoMOphBiC reMaRks tOo" from years ago. UN SPEECH. Get updated pic.twitter.com/adQn9nIy05
So you mean BTS Paid my teacher who is all the way in Canada. Who teaches at a private secondary school. To show my whole University level class the impact and importance of BTS to the worlds youth through their UN speech. And the global impact they leave. pic.twitter.com/A3iwPZ76Js
Did you really just say that nobody knows bts outside of Twitter. When schools abroad are adding their UN speech into curriculums. When their songs are being played in radios all over the world?¿ and them winning awards from globally known award shows. ?
i know everyone posts those videos of random ppl dancing to namjoon’s UN speech for humor, but what if .... i were to actually ..... choreography a contemporary routine ..... to this speech ..... maybe i could even add some instrumentals in the back ....... perhaps a bts song....
Am a disappointed Jungkook stan just bought bts concert GA standing ticket last month... It’s not ok when you’re world’s top boy band, idol to teenagers, gave a speech at UN and on the cover of Time. Face yourself first, then love yourself. @TIME @UNICEF @BigHitEnt @BTS_twt @UN https://twitter.com/guardiannews/status/1062019907833999360 …
I think this is purely politic. BTS now is an influential figures that really popular around the world from SK. They do so much more than music, they do unicef and gave a speech in un. The target might be not bts, but sk in general. Bts got cultural Merritt from the gov, +
what if bts and bighit will include namjoon's UN speech on their next album? just like when they put namjoon's speech at their first billboard award
#BTS #SimonWiesenthalCenter #Auschwitz Korean boyband BTS notorious for discriminating and mocking war victims posed as an Auschwitz Birkenau victim. As a person educated to admire Chiune Sugihara, I cannot subdue my fury. The band recently gave plausible humanity speech at UN. pic.twitter.com/DjE804Z6Uz
BTS on my country’s national television, it says the global boyband from Korea BTS gave a inspirational speech at UN, so proud! #BTS #방탄소년단 @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/lLhN7CsASG
I don't know him, but after #BTS speech at @UN, you know they have big influence, but they have no idea on the thread of atomic bomb even South Korea also faced to it and monitor the border 24hours/365days? You just feel it's right wing propaganda. It's wrong idea, I think.
Today I went out with her to pick some presents for our school program, she told me she spent time watching BTS MVs, namjoon UN speech, so many interviews, and picked a bias already. Hahahaaaaaahaaaa
Sorry, i wrote that, walking. My bad writing. I meant "I only know facts of his speech at UN and a pic of wearing that kinda T-shirt. "
One of my friends who doesn't like BTS's music came across RM's speech at the UN. She said okay I understand now although I don't like their music I respect them for what they said & what they are doing. I was just so happy :( they deserve all the respect & love in this world.
I knew Japanese were the one of the country started the War II even if BTS weren't wearing that T.Because of I knew the history and I also knew there's connection between the War I and War II.Since BTS as a group whom did a speech on UN. I thought they shouldn't Advocate hatred.
REMEMBER RM SPEECH ARMIES NOW CAN YOU STOP BULLYING OUR GIRLS YOU NEVER BEEN LEARN FROM THOSE SPEECH THAT YOUR STAN SAID DURING THE UN!! THE BTS ITSELF HAVE NO ISSUE ON WHAT HAPPEN DURING THE MGA YOUR THE ONE WHO STARTED THIS SHITS SO FUCK AGAIN ARMIES! RT PLS THIS HAHA!
Omg thank you for the support. That speech of BTS in UN was very moving. Let's all apply what are the boys wants us to do, make the world a better place and stop bullying.
I'm 19 & I am a guy Also I am straight and like em not only like but I follow em, listen to their music and also admire em cause besides being wonderful artists they're amazing people who are doing amazing stuff around the world. You don't believe me ? Watch the UN speech by RM.
Sorry, i don't know much about him and his group, too. Just know facts of his speech at UN and wearing that kinda T-shirt.
My Japanese students are mostly businessmen and I discussed the school news article about BTS' UN speech to some of them and I am so glad that most of them know @BTS_twt and they said they are popular in Japan even if they haven't listened to them yet.
most of the classes are using namjoon's UN speech for their lessons for this month and so i'm constantly hearing namjoon's voice from all the classrooms. is this heaven? @BTS_twt 's inspirational impact :')
You should research first before you assume something like that. They have a message and if what you said is true then why would they hold a speech at the UN?
AT LEAST listen to the UN speech before you make assumptions. They are legends and are making history not because they are a well known kpop brand that broke walls but because they came from a bankrupt company while the only bands that got DAESANGS are from the big three

better than that, i saw them #namjoon's song's lyrics "Do You" n his speech in the UN... they were amazed on how they could have such power in voicing youth matters not only through their songs but also in this international formal forum... considering they're from Korea

favorite moment: When the boys went to the UN and Namjoon gave that powerful speech (so proud of them) how i found them: it was through a reaction video of @RobertIDK of Not Today/Dope & decided to check the mvs out myself. wasn’t disappointed at all

Bts have been to the UN to give a speech for the youth. They reminded us who we were and we could stand for eachother and do everything we want. They reminded us to love ourselves to get out of every darkness. What you say more? @BTS_twt #WePurpleYouBTS
Unlike other groups bts have owned up to their mistakes by apologizing and not only that but educating themselves. They were young and naive and they know that. However now Namjoon as the leader addresses his mistakes as part of his speech in the UN. Being educated is key.
fav moment: when they gave the UN speech
not how the media in my country is talking about this issue with bts but they never talked about them, not even when they gaved a speech at the UN, i'm sick of this
For real the proof is after their UN speech the only Isuperwoman said was “ a lot of girls are crying/screaming at horn right now “ ... instead of acknowledging the strength of RM’s speech.
So this is my friend's ws story She is a law student During her class the lecturer plays video of KIM NAMJOON's speech at the UN Im so proud of my boys @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/kwb7e4b2Cc
then i was like "......wait a minute, how did you know they did speech at the un? damn bts this powerful huh even someone like you know about it" LENEKSKSKS THEN HE TRIED TO DOGDE IT THAT ITS COMPLETY ACCIDENT HE FOUND ABOUT THE UN SPEECH SKSNDMMDDM
This is Kor TV quiz show for high school students and there was a Q on BTS. "RM made a speech at UN General Assembly, which was a part of Unlimited Generation campaign by 'this' foundation. What is the name of the organization?" A was UNICEF as u know. :) @bts_twt
namjoon’s un speech on speaking ourselves will always hold a special place in my heart, how he and the bts members are on this journey to loving ourselves more each day. its not easy to love ourselves but im glad that they and armys are doing it together.

It is hard to write eloquently on social media but I am going to say one last thing. The fans of BTS are a force when it comes to the love they have for BTS. I suggest you take time to read the band's lyrics, listen to RMs UN speech & please be kind in this matter.
If you manage to recite almost all Namjoon speech at the UN. YOU GOT THIS BISH!!! @BTS_twt #BTS
Hi everyone, i have been trying to write a paper about @BTS_twt and i need your help. I would need to know, How BTS has helped you in any way, specifically with their recent Love Yourself Albums series. Also the UN speech that Namjoon did. Thank you if you are able to help.
Wait.....In Namjoon's speech in UN,"SPEAK YOURSELF" was the focal point and he talks about his past & what led him who he is today .So if ARMY theorist is right SPEAK YOURSELF will be the next era and it could focus on BTS past that made them who they are today

My mum really changed our flight tickets so that I can see bts next year and she comes and asks questions about bts when I watch them She said she respects Namjoon when she saw his UN speech etc etc I love how she’s so support of whatever I do
I think you should talk about their activism and their UN speech! Also, there was an article of a local whose little sister is ARMY, and she’s blind. The local took her sister to the BTS concert and was moved by her sister’s reaction.
i just added my demon sister and a friend to my spotify family acct and demanded they add wiom they were shocked it was all in english and they said bts keeps trending on facebook lately.. they saw the UN speech, GMA idol dance, and the BBMAs stage. They only know "RapMon"

They really wrote this when Jungkook tweeted using emojis of all skin types, RM spoke about people of all skin colors in his UN speech, Bts chose to censor the word nega in their song in order to not offend black listeners, apologized multiple times about their problematict past-
My favorite BTS memory is when RM gave his speech at the UN. I was so proud BTS worked so hard to get where they were, they survived antis and made their own brand. They responded to everyone ignored them and disrespect through success. The U.N, speech wasn't just a (1/2)
I also showed my mom Namjoon's UN speech and some BTS She said joon sounds like Benedict cumberbatchand if "Day6 and the rose are more famous bc they have the better songs" She just hardcore roasted BTS yikes
26- 28 Bts taught me to stay confident and this goes out to ARMY too! DO YOU! DONT CHANGE YOURSELVES! Anyways when i bts went to the UN and watching rm’s speech like OMG! Rm saying that ARMY has been a huge part of their lives it meant alot to me. #50ReasonsBTS
Also i didnt know touring= living in america. Lol also bts cant exactly turn down when they're called to UN to give a speech or ellen and other talk shows. This is called being relevant and big enough for people to care. Your faves would go too if they were called.

A guy @work saw one of my IG posts from the @BTS_twt Chicago concert “My daughter begged to go, it’s all she listenes to,” he said w furrowed brow. “You like them?” I hit the highlights (write own music/UN speech/social&political songs/many genres)& told him abt BurnTheStage...

Do you remember That guy who works at aBc who made a comment on live TV saying that they are just a boy band from Korean? Because they were making their Un speech? I don't trust aBc
And suddenly those kpopies wanna dragged our boys and saying that UN social awareness speech and time magazine must be affected. This is karma for them and our fandom deserved it. I can't see where's the karma they talked bout? Can yall see how stupid they are?
keep in mind this is someone who has the bare minimum exposure to k-pop and knew about bts through namjoon's un speech so this was a fresh experience for her. bts have truly something special that's to account for their success here.
My daughter's favorite band, BTS @bts_bighit @BTS_twt gave this wonderful speech at the UN and wanted to share. https://youtu.be/dxWGbsqTxeo
my favourite bts moment is when namjoon gave the un speech
i used to be too shy to ask this, but ever since @BTS_twt Namjoon's speech at the UN, i've felt more confident. please use neutral [they/them] pronouns when referring to me uwu

Me too. It's 3 am for me and I couldn't sleep. Been repeating his un speech, sheed some tears, and listening to mono (which make it worst). This girl will sure have a mess face tomorrow
feel like we were taking a big step forward w the UN speech and stuff and now it’s a step backwards and i hate it i hate how they are treating bts and i csnt do sht
Honestly the BBC news didn't even cover the UN speech properly and here they had a full on discussion. I'm so frustrated. That person made it seem like the fans are blind to insensitive topics and no matter what we will support BTS. Like wt* was that?

Raising 1M dollars w/ unicef??*mute* Wbk y'all only talk about bts just to bash and degrade them pic.twitter.com/ixQccghF5A
Lmaothe ONLY person who spoke in UN was RM not Jimin,Jimin is the person who wore that tshirt & FYI Rm is the only member of bts who could speak English fluently the other members just stood behind his back while he's having a speech,Maybe U could do some research b4 u judge ppl
@BTS_twt My favorite BTS memory is when they had a speech at the UN and seeing how hard Joon worked for that speech
When join said " I really thought Pdnim wasn't satisfied with me" I remembered the UN speech when he said "no one called my name and neither did I" :((
this article is good at how they talked about what's makes bts amazing they talked about bts from debut, how bts produce their own musics, their songs meaning, bts influences like un speech, time cover, social influence, bt21, etcs https://twitter.com/ellejapan/status/1060860828830887936 …

No matter what the T-shirt means or doesn’t mean, the combination of the atomic bomb and the happy people cannot be acceptable. Despite their words in the UN speech: “I want to hear your voice, no matter who you are,” they don’t want to hear anything they don’t want to hear. #bts

So my bf messaged me the bbc news story about @BTS_twt and the cancelled shows because he knows I listen to them so I decided to set the record straight and ended up explaining their music and long story short now he’s gonna go watch the UN speech
so our local news reported about bts getting blocked from guesting in a show in japan but they never said anything about namjoon’s speech and bts’ attendance at the un or how they support such a good cause or literally anything that’s good and relevant
The videos cost the doble of money and it's for just few ours and this is for a whole week I saw the prices of the company There is a QR on the ad so if you scan it it will send u to the un speech, were is the diference? I don't see the hate pic.twitter.com/aHT6nQiqDo
@UNICEF All of you UNICEF You made a speech at UNICEF's campaign at the UN General Assembly headquarters Korean band BTS hurt Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb victims and Japanese people. Because of the pride of the Japanese, we can not forgive BTS and UNICEF.
y’all really throwing bts under the bus like that huh. Your faves didn’t even chart with their debut anpanman. BTS for the win I will keep stanning bts until the day bt21 gives a speech at the UN or attends the grammys

This is seriously cool! I almost cried when Nam Joon did the UN speech!
With a quick google search I found many BTS OT7 pics from UN speech but if you guys don’t want Jungkook in the pic of course you snakes chose that pic for advertisement, I’m not amused..bunch of snakes pic.twitter.com/QK4UbbCtVe
My theory is speak yourself because if you remember for love yourself they put it within their billboard speech speak yourself was mentioned so many times in thier UN speech and it just sounds right cuz after you learned to love yourself you can learn to speak yourself
I think the Grammy Museum conversation, plus the UN speech were huge pluses for #BTS I am hopeful! Give Yoongi his Grammy! pic.twitter.com/O6o4XlT1zc
my little sisters teacher really played namjoon's UN speech for them in class and discussed it with them it was weird my sister never talks about bts with me but she told me this as soon as she came home
the reason why the next bts cb and the last era for reflection of youth is going back to hyyh is that, during that era is where they receive most and worst criticism in their lives, remember what namjoon said "speak yourself" during his un speech he wants us to talk +

Why does everyone hate on this project and Spanish ARMYs? His head is there, it's not like he doesn't even appear. Also, I think the fact that they promoted the UN speech is wonderful. Yo os apoyo. La gente puede ser un poco inmadura a veces

Today one of my friends was setting next to me on our way home & she was on her phone showing me FB posts when suddenly a pic of Tae from a FB page appears on her TL & I was like OH She told them they're BTS & this is her favorite "V" she also said she watched their UN speech -
And it needed to be the moment of the speech because thats what we are promoting, the fAct that bts spoke at the UN. Which is what people will be interested in and therefore they will look for bts and see that there are 7 members.
pictures like this is better since it sends postive msg as well if they are having problems with lack of photos from the un speech pic.twitter.com/EKZuBBECW5
your serious?? I just fought 4 exols for DRAGGING Jimin voice. Did anyone decide to help? We did not even drag your faves voice. You guys mistranslated Rm speech at UN. Bts got sent to COURT because of false accusations of "plasarism". The FUCK are you talking about?
True. Bts shouldnt just talk to the world. They have to educate their fans first. Speech at un means nothing if armys still being toxic
then why pursue the project? you could have altered the theme..instead of sacrificing Jungkook..there are so many good quality pics that may not be from the actual UN speech but still in the vicinity of UN that could be used or even those they have from UNICEF
Namjoon and BTS didn't go to make a speech at the UN for their work to be disrespected for ALL fandoms including our own because we are at fault as well i don't care what you say.
Let the countdown BEGIN! 7 DAYS till the big day! From a scale of Tired Yoongi to UN Speech Namjoon, how nervous/excited you are? #BurnTheStageTheMovie #BTS pic.twitter.com/H9duJFxItm
like what i said..so you decided to sacrifice Jungkook so you can accomplish your goal..there are lots of photos not on the actually speech but still on UN Assembly..seems like your goal is more important than having them complete..thats ur call but dont expect us not to be upset
Wow - that’s so thorough and very impressively put together. I remember hearing a similar sentiment in his UN speech. Fine work!
Me to my dad: Pa, watch this (Joonie's legendary speech in UN GA). Your perspective in life will change if you watch this vid. Papa: I've seen that. Me: WHEN? WHERE? HOW? Papa: I've been watching BTS videos in your laptop while you were outside. @BTS_twt my dad loves you
sometimes i just wanna quit twitter because the hate against army is getting so much but i remember i can get to witness things like the release of mono and everyone crying over bts in un speech. theres always the more beautiful things and i try not to let the bad ones win over
Class reflection question: Who do you look up to and what did they do that impressed you? Me: writes a whole essay about why I love @BTS_twt and why I look up to them. Talks about their message towards the youth. Emphasizes the message of their speech at the UN. pic.twitter.com/U4zTWmjKR2
First of it's clear that your favs is no big deal coz it proves from the thing that UN invited BTS for the speech and not your so called talented group
There is on going debate in my club and they are bringing the motion of kpop consumption and gdi they are pushing the old agenda and now im sitting here wanting to shout EXCUSE ME BUT BTS IS CHANGING THE WOLRD AND THEY HAD SPEECH AT THE UN TO SPREAD THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEAK URSELF
@BTS_twt UN SPEECH IS THE BEST
The speech of BTS in UN was to end violence. This is a serious issue. Everyone in this world should know that it is not about fandom but the real life. Some one could be in trouble now. #ENDviolence
BTS is honestly the only group that has brought genuine feelings of happiness and excitement to my life in a very, very long time. Their emotional songs resonate with me in a very personal way, and RM's speech at the UN spoke to me. I wouldn't be who I am now w/o BTS. #ENDviolence
last two days in my class,my muet teacher show us the video abt UN speech by BTS..sbb masa tu topic kami bincang is about Youth... and tnpa disangka my teacher show us that video... just bcs of rm's speech very meaningful and powerful..
I'm really sorry to any nice and kind army that follows me but this is one of the reason i don't even feel impressed about bts gave speech at UN for end violence campaign. Yall can't even practice it. Pls it hurts you know how some of you constantly labelling him w the worst name
Remember what namjoon said on their speech at un? No matter who you are, your skin color, your identity just speak yourself. Don’t be afraid to show who you truly are. Fight for our rights. We are family here i purple you all #ENDviolence @BTS_twt
“No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself." -Kim Namjoon UN speech @BTS_twt #ENDviolence
You don't see what us ARMYs have been doing, this is very disrespectful, Kim namjoon didn't make a un speech to be treated like this, BTS didn't make a whole ass campaign for you to say that
when bts got a chance to speak at the UN again, i believe their speech will slap you hard on the face
I'm rewatching Namjoon's UN speech & it always touches my heart I printed this speech & carry it around with me everywhere I go. His speech makes me feel so emotional. BTS was there when I was in a dark place I'm still learning how to love myself & I want to thank them for that
fear..perhaps? but i wont let it silence me. I love my bts fam so very much too important to just not speak up or not say anything. very sad too see silence... See Namjoons UN speech encourage one another. Report. Simply dont engage.
Just remember this “No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself." -Kim Namjoon UN speech @BTS_twt SPEAK YOURSELF And show haters u can stand up for urself! #ENDviolence
To ARMY that are relunctant and hesitant to spread this campaign, i would like to remind you this is what BTS speech at the UN Generation Unlimited is all about. BTS urge us to speak for ourself. This is the time. Speak Yourself. #ENDviolence
To be straight, yes. Monstax is not as globally popular as bts, so there may be less ppl who criticize monstax. Another difference is, bts when to the UN and made a speech there about world peace.This means bts is quite influential compared to other groups.
what if bts already gave us a hint? what if next is "Speak Yourself" like what namjoon emphasized on his UN speech? 1. Face Yourself 2. Love Yourself and jin has a letter S on his shirt. pic.twitter.com/LF9iPscsqx
BTS is out here spreading more love than anyone else I’ve ever seen. They are preaching to us to love ourselves and what a damn good message to hear. In their UN speech Namjoon encouraged us to be ourselves and “Speak Yourself”
hugs for u fam! I would consider 45/100 when u r not comfortable talking in front of a lot of people as a good score alrdy. Even someone seasoned like our beloved RM was trembling during his UN speech...U did great and will only continue to improve! Fighting!
Like he recognized them from a picture and knew about the UN speech, clearly an ARMY out there is doing their job promoting them but that's how it always starts @BTS_twt
REMEMBER WHEN KOOKIE SAID IT AFTER THE UN SPEECH IN THE BTS EPISODE?

my mum has grown to really like bangtan ever since I showed her idol, epiphany and the UN speech, which is why now whenever someone asks her who are her favourite musicians she answers "ed sheeran & bts" and seeing that warms my heart
I really hope to get into Model UN because if I do, I get to fly to New York, and sit in the seats @BTS_twt sat, while having real live debates with other students about the same things joon said his speech
Spanish ARMY have paid for an ad in the "Cuidad Universitaria" metro station in Madrid, to promote @BTS_twt UN speech and their Love Yourself message. The ad will stay there for around a week Project by BeyondtheSpain pic.twitter.com/kyOOn9ExZz
surprised about the fact that a foreign group spoke at the UN. He minors in political studies so the UN speech really left a big impression on him. Anyway so we talked about BTS & he asked me how I got into them & why so I told him the whole story & then we talked a bit about uni
BTS trained so hard to just get their songs and lyrics heard, they didn’t expect anything more and now look at them: UNICEF, Puma, World Cup, UN Speech, BBMAs, AMAs, American & UK talk shows, Billboard Charts, MTV, Teen Choice, American Collaborations ect ect. Well deserved~
Another research that I’ll do for my assignment on college is analysis the BTS’ UN Speech. Lol, wish me luck
Namjoon's speech at the UN really impacted me. I always felt a little under confident to really try writing, but I'm finally doing it for this years @NaNoWriMo and I'm actually believing in what I write for the 1st time ever.

Let’s think a little outside the box, here. What did Kim Namjoon ask us to do in his UN Speech? Speak yourself, right? He didn’t say shut everyone up or spread hate. I imagine he would want for more. Use your voice for change. Be a positive force in this world! #BTS #BTSARMY
im so happy for BTS. they'll be so happy to meet ARMYs. the 150 ARMYs give lots of love to BTS. let them know how much we appreciate all their hardwork. they have been doing a lot : two cbs, tour, UN speech, all the promo,, let them know we believe in them & will always support. https://twitter.com/hopefulmyg/status/1060028374477955073 …
Literally saw someone (supposedly an army bc a jimin @lol) say bts is “just a band” and that it doesn’t matter when as armys we’ve been trying for the longest time to show they’re more than “just a band”? Like were they “just a band” when they gave the UN speech? https://twitter.com/THICKJlMIN/status/1060044696989372416 …
Lol. I just played the UN speech at full volume in the break room... And spammed the company radio station... And blasted the music everytime I was in the backroom for more than five minutes... Lol. ARMYs started popping up all over the store.
Yeah, and all the merchandise sold out at every concert. And UN speech! UNICEF ambassadors! And 3x RIAA gold! 2x #1 BB200. At least 5x BH100. Collabs with Grammy winning & nominated producers. The list goes on and on! ARMYS are real. I only worry about how much sleep ARMYS get.

Before I go, I just want to say that more than the many awards that @BTS_twt won tonight at the #MGA2018, I think the most touching part of the show is the VCR, where they showed the boys from their debut days to their UN speech 'coz wow they've come really REALLY far. #BTSatMGA

THE UN SPEECH PLEASE WHY #BTSatMGA @BTS_twt
THE UN SPEECH @BTS_twt #BTSatMGA
BTS not winning global award after literally returning from a world tour, with a sold out US stadium show and having a comeback stage at the BBMAS and Namjoon giving out his presidential speech at the UN is literally the funniest thing in the world

In all seriousness; Namjoon is also known as 'RM' or 'Rap Monster'. Hes the leader and a rapper for popular kpop bb (boy band) BTS. Idk if youre memeing or legit asking so I figured id give a real answer. Hes also a good motivational speaker. Watch his UN speech!

I have to do a unit of instruction for my grad class and my theme is including popular culture elements into composition classes (English classes). I’m trying to somehow include BTS and RM’s UN speech but I’m also trying to somehow fit the standards of the university
You should check out their speech at the UN meeting then! It’s in English so no worries about that c:
bts: legends, went #1 on billboard 200 twice in 4 months, broke taylor swifts youtube record, collaborated with miki minach, UN speech and more aaand more all this in 2018. zayn: gigi hadid
[ARTICLE] 181104 "RM's UN speech" (https://m.entertain.naver.com/read?oid=016&aid=0001460249&fbclid=IwAR2JWuUCAXV8RFX2QDRA2mg8E46nccGKiJYdvqayDSO1j18cF0WlGFldcl4 …) @BTS_twt #BTS #방탄소년단pic.twitter.com/VJXyxNBH1I
Ok I found a random video on YouTube(one part was bts related about rm/jin/jk), finds comment, I process writing an whole article that took me 30mins to write explaining all the good things bts did(like sharing the message of self love+(UN speech)) and then that:( @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/wCcZbCaZ2H
"I have come to love myself for who i am, for who i was and for who i hope to become" - Kim Namjoon UN speech 2018 #방탄소년단 #BTS ⁠ #RM #김남준 #Namjoon @BTS_twt cr. @standbyRMpic.twitter.com/RU1NTtpIQ7
Itll probably just be a collection of things bts has done that made my love for them solidify, like the un speech, music production, how hard they work, their love for each other, etc
I like how y’all say how good exo are, that they’re a lot better than BTS and keep talking about their 25 daesangs but like they’re not, if they were better than BTS they would chart, have out sold concerts all over the world, UN speech, BBMA, AMA+
6 albums - self-written/composed/produced songs + 1 single + world tour for months, still on-going + UN speech, interviews & tv appearances during world tour + flying back to SK to attend awards show/ceremony during tour + filming bts run!, bon voyage, festa, muster, etc. damn.
I don't know WHO your faves are. I know they work hard, but was it 2018 BTS hard? From filming, to writing, to producing, to interviews, to UN speech, to AGT, to dance practice, to recording, to etc. They don't sleep. Don't be salty when my boys get their WELL DESERVED AWARDS.
bts released two albums, had a cb stage at the bbmas, were the first korean act to hold a concert at citifield, had a speech at the un, performed at the korea-france friendship concert, received their order of cultural merit and more. they deserve artist of the year award
OOF 72* Not to mention the 2 day 4th muster(annual fanmeeting), 5th festa,attending ceremonies, interviews, being frequent on vlive as they can after concert, UN speech,run bts every week(before the world tour) and ETC..
Actually, I told him about the UN speech first so he told me that he'll "watch this famous UN speech" This is now my mission.
BTS and their UN SPEECH are used for exams these days.... WHERE WAS THIS WHEN I WAS STILL A STUDENT! #MTVEMABiggestFansBTS @BTS_twt

im so emotional, world is rly treating joon's un speech like it's the new yes we can @BTS_twt
bts doesnt need to copy anything from your faves, their way above your level. call me when your faves make a speech at the UN, get watched from the president of Korea, and get known as Koreas boy band. youre fucking blind. how sad. next.
We can’t say that the reason that @BTS_twt’s story & UN speech are used for exam all over the world is only because they are popular but because they make good influence to the youth in the world and the value or faith they are pursuing can get global consensus and universality.
K media said that RM’s UN speech has been used for the exam at the schools in US, Korea, Singapore & Vietnam. Ask about ‘Love yourself’ or encourage the students ‘Speak yourself’ as assignments.

You mean the UN speech is on SC?

. @BTS_twt’s UN speech has been appearing as Test questions or school assignments in many countries such as US, Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. It explains BTS’ isn’t just simply popular but their ideas are providing positivity to young generations. http://naver.me/xogbFq9s pic.twitter.com/PE7xUgdcRN
also, they gave an amazing speech at UN and performed on America's Got Talent. In addition they have been to many American TV shows and radios.... skskskks
You are absolutely right sis BTS could never achieve that. US stadium, billboard 200 #1, UN speech and Order of Merit means nothing, honestly we can do better. Army come on.
I love u @BTS_twt take care always and enjoy your break rest well legends that has 2 #1’s on bb200 and many entries on bb100 and has 3 golds and awarded by the highest award in korea and has sold out all their tours also that give a speech at the un and has a front page on time-
I'm doing joon's un speech for my speech class next and I haven't practiced yet. @BTS_twt. http://Mr.Kim I'm sorry please forgive me
i was just telling my work trip mates that im into kpop and this media person from the star (aged around 40+) added on that bts gave a speech on UN, and she finds jimin the most handsome & that they are bigger than b*gbang and is the most influential rn WHAT A WORLD IM LIVING IN
. @punichow You asked who is #BTS @BTS_twt earlier. Here are they in the @UN speech at the United Nations Headquarters @UNICEF @bts_love_myself @_GenUnlimitedhttps://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
you know...the kpop community really shows its fake woke side when everyone comes together to belittle bts like invalidating their billboard award or UN speech like, do yall not get??? their accomplishments are huge for the asian community??? yall are closet racists...
They really call joon's un speech the 'speak yourself' speech. Imagine knowing nothing about bts and seeing the speak yourself speech in the history book. Imagine kids saying his speech in declamations. Imagine quoting his speech "what is your name? Speak yourself". @BTS_twt
Pls their achievements aren’t even comparable in the first place. They’re nowhere near each other omg. BTS had a whole UN Speech, was awarded with Order or Cultural Merit medal, performed at a diplomat event in Paris, had 2 #1 BB200 albums & multiple Hot100 entries, just sold out
Yesss... I already have my tickets and I bringing my mom so she can see and understand why I love @BTS_twt ... They kinda win her with the UN speech... I'm just gonna seal the deal with the movie
Ajxjwjc I am in an fb group called "Youth For Asia" and I was shookt they posted @BTS_twt' speech at UN as part of I think their ad for a volunteer convention for youth here in my country omg I was sp shookted!!!

14. I love @BTS_twt because they are incredibly open minded and outspoken but in a good way!! they support lgbtq+ and literally RM's UN speech. They also speak up for what they believe in.
Excuse me @TwitterSupport I just looked back to @BTS_twt post for the UN speech and my likes and rt disappeared. Why is that happening? It keeps happening and I don’t want it to affect their social 50 status cuz your system is malfunctioning! pic.twitter.com/nGpiA9e8FU
@BTS_twt does make me feel braver. I recently hosted a turnover ceremony and I was so anxious about it. But I keep on remembering Joonie’s UN speech. Before that I would’ve never considered speaking in front of so many people, let alone do emceeing. Thank you Bangtan https://twitter.com/SelinaLuvsBTS7/status/1058506694949519360 …
YOU ARE AMAZING AND I STILL CAN'T GET OVER YOUR SPEECH AT THE UN YOU ARE AMAZING
5. They are really good at public speaking. Namjoon, for example, gave an amazing speech at the UN. He can express his thoughts in such a poetic way, it's unreal. @BTS_twt #RM
Yeah and kanye also said slavery was a choice, while BTS gave a speech at the UN about self love
IT WAS NAMJOON'S SPEECH HE GAVE AT THE UN "What's your name? Speak yourself By Kim NamJoon from BTS " AND I STARTED FREAKING OUT?? I LEGIT GOT A HEART ATTACK I LOVE MY SCHOOL??? Anyways thanks for reading my rant bye bye
My friend just told me that a friend of his has been posting @BTS_twt lately. She's an 8th grade teacher & after hearing Joonie's UN speech she was moved and looked them up...I'm beaming with pride guys
p much the whole un speech @BTS_twt
what you said was wrong. bts literally talks about it till this day. namjoon literally mentioned it in his UN speech but go off ig
Wrong bts album title and life quote Maybe you need to learn more about bts or unstan I'd suggest with watching namjoon's UN Speech #LoveYourself
I told my History teacher to watch Namjoon’s UN speech yesterday and he told me today that he really liked it im happy uwu @BTS_twt
Nakita ko siya ngayon. I’m just so happy. Mas comfortable na kami together. I loved our chat bc it’s not just about our personal lives/work but also music. Syempre I need to promote BTS and she liked it. She watched their UN speech and did complement RM for the good msg.

Easily offended na kung easily offended, but you don't make fun of @BTS_twt and their UN speech. Not on my watch.
Listening to @BTS_twt's songs and UN speech honestly motivates me in my studies and to become a better person each day .. ya'll
Who do we need validation from now? Just drop videos of @BTS_twt 's The Grammy Museum Interview, KMA Musician of the Year Daesang, The UN General Assembly Speech, NME Mono review &Pitchfork LY Tear Review so they can shut tf up. They aint worth our time. #MTVEMABiggestFansBTS
My stepbrother's girlfriend asked me about BTS and the concert in Berlin and wanted to know who the boys are and I suddenly was so happy that someone was interested, really feels good. She also was impressed about some facts, the UN speech for example.
Good evening, BTS have one of the fastest selling album in 2018, BTS have raised over 1.6 Billion won within a year since Love Myself campaign has launched, BTS's UN speech are being used as a reference for assignments of speech elements. @BTS_twt are influence at it's finest.

2018 ACHIEVEMENTS : BTS UN SPEECH #MTVEMABiggestFansBTS @BTS_twt
BTS have achieved a lot of things this year. let alone their UN speech about the love yourself campaign, and many many more! if theres one group who’s worthy of the AOTY its them and them only! #BTS #MAMAVOTE
So... WE GOT 2 COMEBACKS. COLLABS. (IF IT RELEASES EARLY) THE RAPLINE'S MIXTAPES. AWARDSSSS UN SPEECH JAPANESE ALBUM MVs AND MORE.... IN A FUCKING YEAR! ONE YEAR BITCHES! I STAN HARD WORK AND REAL TALENT. #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt
Giving Artist Of The Year award to other artist is so ridiculous while @BTS_twt had became Best Seller artists, performed at BBMAs, got awarded by BBMAs, AMAs, etc, delivered inspirational speech at the UN, ALL IN 2018. I hope Mnet won't be that stupid. #MTVEMABiggestFansBTS
armys, only have to stream wiom, mono, answer, and tag @BTS_twt to keep them on charts: i barely have time namjoon, works on Tiger Jk collab, answer, mono, UN speech, tours around N.America and Europe, meets president, leads BTS, reads, breathes: members & armys did it all
OKAY SO MY NON ARMY BEST FRIEND SAW JOON’S SPEECH AT THE UN AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HE CAPTURED HER HEART THERE JUST BY THAT SPEECH ALONE SHSKSHJSSH @BTS_twt THE LONELY WHALE REALLY IS BEING HEARD BY EVERYONE NOW I’M SO-
It's hard to choose just one favourite moment when their whole journey is so inspiring and beautiful but I'll mention the moment when we found out about their speech at UN and was so nervous for them, it felt like we were sending our kids to school for their first big+
My favorite @BTS_twt moment is when our president Kim Namjoon gave his beautiful speech at the UN
so for my senior quote i chose a part of namjoon’s un speech. i decided to choose something that actually inspires me and that’s exactly what @BTS_twt does, they inspire me everyday. i have learn how to love myself and so many more things. i’m so thankful that bts is in my life pic.twitter.com/uW6pXWqbbw

I literally made a sarcastic comment saying “It’s sooooo unfair how BTS is winning in all the categories they’re nominated for,” knowing this will be said by people. What do u expect?!? BTS dominated basically everything this year; from UN speech, billboard, times magazine.
The UN speech #BTS #MAMAVote @BTS_twt
i was asked about who my role model is at my interview just now and i said rm and talked about the UN speech and my interviewer said she'll look him up and i was like KAY HES IN A BAND CALLED BTS !!! we going free promo
Apple said it was a Llama! There is also the UN Flag which I thought was great for when we mention #Namjoon ‘s speech!!!

Not to be biased but statistically speaking, @BTS_twt are the ones best suited for the album and artist of the year. 4M+ album sales??? UN speech??? BBMAs???? Worldwide domination????? BTS did more
BTS is Billboard's reigning Top Social Artist, which means fans worldwide understand them just fine. There are 7 members, 1 of whom is fluent in English & addressed the UN in a moving speech that was covered worldwide. They are grown men who don't need permission to speak Korean. https://twitter.com/UyandaM/status/1057947273081040896 …
Just watched this 21 min documentary on @BTS_twt rise to success and eventhough I did not understand it, I still followed along based on the video clips from their debut all the way to UN speech, Order of Culture Merit award, and UNICEF LY campaign. Still got me in my feelings https://twitter.com/BTSARMY_MIA1013/status/1057971403561914369 …
Those dudes who made a speech on UN, have the order of cultural merit award, known by many western artist, made songs which encourages the youth to not be afraid to speak for themselves, and the ones who also saved me, who were them again??? Ah yes... @BTS_twt ofc
Ya know, last Mon. There's three inc me talked about @BTS_twt during public speaking. Inspirational/motivation lyrics, the UN speech and Love myself campaign. It was great
What BTS gifted us with in 2018... Societal Impact wise Continuation of campaign with Unicef Speech at the UN General Assembly Korea/France friendship concert Insane chart results ALL over the world most viewed MV on YT in first 24 hours #MAMAVOTE #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/8bbq3jJ954
Namjoon really did two whole BTS albums, a solo mixtape, featurings, a world tour, a UN speech and a whole lot more in just one year and yet here I am desperately trying to clean my room as if it’s going to clean the mess that is my life. How does he do it?
a few days after the UN speech I am the new baby to the family hey yallll @BTS_twt
I am so proud to be a part of this noble cause. I became an ARMY because of LOVE YOURSELF. I am so proud of all the seven members. They even gave a speech at the UN Assembly. It is really a huge honour, I can't imagine how nervous they might be but they did it so well. I U all
at this point I'm still amazed and still very in awe of how BTS, a kpop idol group, managed to have that much recognition and influence that they succeed in giving a speech at the UN. I mean like...... that is a big deal, man.
The teacher is soooo brilliant like he/she put that namjoon's UN speech for the assignment so every single student would read that amazing message inside that long text speech which is very important 4 every young generation around the world SEND MUCH LOVE TO HIM/HER! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/9yHGT1LxiC

i was telling my dad abt bts in the car just now and it was the first time ever that he was listening so intently abt what i had to say abt them,,, he was really surprised by their impact in korea and the US, and he also rmbed abt their speech at the UN
It is 12 o'clock at night where I am and I m already crying, listening to your words, LOVEMYSELF in the background, and thinking that a month has passed since his speech at the UN. Why do I have to be so sensitive? I'm proud and happy for you
You guys are the true hope, Hope, and sensation. Honestly UN was big event for us. We have talked about it together it’s really an honor and it’s an unbelievable experience. BTS in UN wow it’s incredible. And RM has presented a speech representing all of us.
Is Namjoon a real person??? Like on top of touring and BTS activities he releases a mixtape, memorizes an all English speech for the UN, and writes+record a rap part to feature on Drunken Tiger’s last album???? What is time management pic.twitter.com/r86SpLPseF
how does Namjoon cope with so much on his plate when I can barely survive?! - World tour - UN speech - KoreaXFrance Friendship Concert - Interviews, interviews and interviews - #mono - Participate in @DrunkenTigerJK album #SupeRMan @BTS_twt
Namjoon is so ready to be president listen: he worked on #mono., did the collab with Drunken JK, did the UN speech and performed through the US and Europe.. while keeping @BTS_twt united and happy, I’m actually speechless he is just born to be a leader for our entire generation pic.twitter.com/tTclDWyhND
But if we don’t write a multi-paragraph, MLA format, font 12 Times New Roman, double spaced, one inch margin paper about Namjoon’s UN speech what’s the point @BTS_twt
So you’re telling me that Joon was doing the world tour, working on mono, waste it on me, preparing for UN speech, preparing for all the interviews, probably filmed for more stuff, and is now releasing another collab song...?? HOW?? @BTS_twt seriously are you guys human....
Me:*brushed my teeth once* Meanwhile Namjoon: -went on a world tour -prepared an amazing UN speech -attended the UN and perfectly delivered his amazing speech -produce a mono -became the highest charting korean singer -get rewarded from the Order of Cultural Merit @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Y6gQJh2Y1F
UN speech, mono, tear, answer, collabs with prestigious artists, world tour + the rest of BTS' busy schedule
When you are down, when sadness tries to take control, when you are losing tracks just remember our Legends. Remember that day when RM made that speech in the UN that moved the world. Remember that day you chose to become an Army and learned to love yourself. @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/nXthAVQmL5
You really telling me Namjoon writing his rap part for the drunkentiger feature while he was writing mono, writing the un speech being on a world tour and doing interviews WOW IM ALREADY TIRED! @BTS_twt #namjoon #RMpic.twitter.com/9517gJ8N5Y
Namjoon had time to do a BTS world tour, media appearances, write a UN speech, work on Mono, and work on a new song with Drunken Tiger? Thats the hardest working man on this planet.
Namjoon has been beyond busy: @BTS_twt world tour, UN speech, #mono.... and the man found time to write his verses for yet another colllab?? Joonie, teach me your ways.
LISTEN. HE HAS BEEN BEYOND BUSY. #mono UN SPEECH LY TOUR HOW DOES HE FIND THE TIME?! @BTS_twt

the thing is i started getting interested in @BTS_twt because of the UN speech, so i kind of fell for them because of their message before their music
True... they will never get what BTS haves and yea maybe they have more views( which YG paid for) and More subscribes and shit than BTS but will they have a speech at UN? No I think the fuck not.

As a short introduction, BTS is a south korean boygroup that cover all kinds of topics and music genres. They are simply inspirational and recently gave a UN speech about empowering the youth. Songs I love are e.g. Butterfly, where I could imagine your sweet voice singing- pic.twitter.com/960VNGowcF
I'm so shook, "true beauty" the webtoon not only featured bts but they displayed Namjoon's UN speech, OMFG I wish the english verison will hurry up and update, I need translations of everything
Stop using BTS' advocacies UN speech in arguments. You think you're doing something, trying to shame ppl by saying "BTS would be so disappointed" Their campaign, advocacies and UN speech ain't tailor-made to address your twitter beef get the fuck over yourselves.
@bts_bighit I checked out the UN speech. Very positive for young people! Great job. Me I’m older an voice. Trying to learn about other countries and their struggles. Like South Africa and The Kermish incidents. Trying to stand up for others and wondering who will listen.
Before BTS i feel like I need to pleased all the people around me. Then when I finally meet them they show or teach me that no one is perfect. But what really wake me up from this horrible believe of mine was RM's speech at the UN. He really is the best leader.
people: bts dont even do anything meaningful all they do is look pretty me, wallpapering my living room with kim namjoon's un speech: i'm sorry what was that?

My favorite bts 2018 moment had to be citifield and their UN speech.
a few days after the UN speech uwu.
namjoon since you could refer to his UN speech and also mention he's the leader of bts
Are there any Armys who joined the fandom right after or during BTS's UN speech? @BTS_twt
They hate the fact the K-media is hyping #RMono more than their member. The Korean gp has been quite favourable to #BTS since their UN speech and Order of Merit Award. Unfortunately for them, it was a non-Korean member who charted and ppl just see it as Chinese buying power.
As expected.... I don't think the media play by S* is going as expected esp since #RM charted really high after only 3 days with a Korean album. Also the Korean gp is quite pro- #BTS nowadays since the UN speech and the Order of Cultural Merit award. #RMonoBB200https://twitter.com/JJKBTS14/status/1057119680941490177 …

THANK YOU SO MUCH ARMYS y'all are so sweet I decided to get to know #BTS bc i have seen their UN speech on fb, and i thought wow a kpop group finally talking some sense.
I just had a 1h consultation with my doctor bc of my health (mentally as well as physically) & when he asked what comforts me in life, I said my dog and @BTS_twt ... he knew them. He saw their UN speech. He asked me what comforts me about them ++
U made a caption which shading ARMY who talk about BTS speech on UN, featured on Time magazine's cover, etc. At least it's more better than ur fandom always talk about Olympic and fountain again & again. Ur fandom really don't have anything to say bcs its the only achievement huh
not just numbers, critical acclaim too. bts won moty at kmas the korean grammys, did a speech at the UN, grammy museum etc. like who else is doing that?

Easy, BTS! Their music! Boy, they are versatile! From neo Seoul to hip hop! You choose! https://goo.gl/nDopLH Their message! Encouraging & comforting. From their campaign, to their lyrics! Their UN speech- https://goo.gl/YJQ7yT *Their looks is a bonus*
yall saying how nov 7th is so far away but time flies so fast in bts' world literally the UN speech happened over a month ago???
WOW! An ARMY who spent 8 mths in the jungle finds out all the @BTS_twt news she's missed...oh & the fact that her bias made a speech at the UN! OP: "this is the closest I'll ever get to fulfilling that fantasy of time travelling to tell young BTS of their GLORIOUS future." https://twitter.com/moonIunatik/status/1057011114901495808 …
Can you invite @BTS_twt they're a korean band their impact is so huge, they're ambassadors in UN they have a compagin called love yourself and speak yourself you can check their speech in UNICEF @bts_love_myself @UNICEF THEY R NEXT GENERATION LEADERS
There won’t be a bts no2 NEVER, we shoudl be thankful to stan a group like Bts, who held a speech on UN, helpin ppl go thru w/mental health w/their songs, campaign love myself at UNICEF, so humble, most of their songs self produced self written, so diff then any other artist
since we're already getting a ted talk about bts the next step is namjoon giving a ted talk i know that's gonna change my life just like the un speech
I wonder why @BTS are very popular specially for my daughter @hannah_chann , then I ask her why and she showed me their speech in UN. Now I understand. #LoveYourself #BelieveInYourself #NeverGiveUp #BTS God bless you more BTS https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
“Bts have won over 100 awards, some like the AMA or BMA, became ambassadors to the un, where namjoon gave a motivational speech about equality” “Ya dude but they Chinese their dick small you know that ”
and just taking in consideration the views on the YouTube streaming of the UN event: before and during the presentation of BTS this General Assembly reached more than 120,000 live viewers, and after BTS finished they speech these views fell drastically. Think about it, (4)
Today at my consecutive translation midterm we translated @BTS_twt's speech at the UN, it was such a pleasure to be able to express their message in my native language.
So, they’ve outsold BTS on a longer period of time but look at all the achievements they’ve reached. Did 1D ever speak a whole ass speech at the UN? I think the fuck not. Come at us when 1D /actually/ has something to be proud of besides some record sales, any artist can do that.
Ita BTS hands down. The UN speech which is VERY important to all nations, the TIMES magazine cover that says it all, the YT record proves it all but other groups like NCT are doing great!

i’m still mad about that documentary on french tv where they showed for 3 whole mins “hundreds of teenage girls”, as they said, camping for bts’ concert while they barely showed namjoon’s speech at the UN nor talked about the message of hope that they convey through their music
gn to bts, bangtan soyeondan, bulletproof boyscouts, beyond the scene, first korean act to land #1 on the bb200, the only foreign act to land two #1's on the bb200 in the same year, first korean act to give a speech at the un, first korean act to perform/sell out citifield, ONLY.
@bts_bighit Dear BTS m truly happy for ue UN speech. trust me u just speak out my words. Thanks a lot.... u already broke the barriers. Hope someday u will come in to Bangladesh but I dont knw may meet u in person or not coz u gyz r creazy famous..Good Luck
bts: Namjoon did so well with his UN speech he is so amazing Namjoon: I think we ALL did well
I'm just trying to keep Namjoon's words in the UN speech in my head, I'm trying to be strong for myself, for my country and for @BTS_twt #PrayForBrazil
I’ve been off of stan Twitter for so long... I missed Jimin dying his hair blue, namjoon’s “mono”, bts’ UN speech, waste it on me, also why are they in Paris?? christ #bts
@BTS_twt your fan here needs a copy of your UN speech, thanks
Jimin a member from BTS was wearing a atomic bomb shirt last year. We do not know if he wore it in purpose but he never apologized. This is sad. He's one of the members who gave a speech at the UN this September.
Finishing up my BTS Project on their UN speech!! #BTSxUnitedNations #BTS #BTSLoveMyself #LoveYourself #ly #BANGTAN #ARMYpic.twitter.com/KKKbvEpT8D
idc who bts collabs with; theyre smart and they know what theyre doing. no offense to ch*rlie p*th, but bts are the main stars of that performance. theyre in home territory after achieving 2 number 1 albums, a UN speech, and cultural merit awards
It started on UN speech, now im proud that one of my colleague is now an army. Sharing old vids of @BTS_twt on his FB AND SEEMS LIKE AN OT7. I'M SO EFFIN PROUD! #BTSArmy
"I answer with all my breath and all the path I’ve walked along Yesterday’s me, today’s me, tomorrow’s me (I’m learning how to love myself) Without exception, altogether, they are all me" -answer:love myself by @BTS_twt The lyrics RM used in his UN speech so inspiring& beautiful
Update: I sent one of my #BTS playlist to my cousin today. She texted me back and said she liked it and she watched and enjoyed the UN speech I recommended to her. Also she likes Joons voice. I just sent her the full @BTS_twt playlist. I'm working hard for my Kings. #wasteitonmehttps://twitter.com/Iarmytears/status/1054084416019013633 …
Um hon ur talking ab BTS so don't compare ur trash to LEGENDS and ab the talent BTS already saved it nd u can check UN speech nd learn frm kings
BTS were chosen to deliver a speech at the UN because they are involved as UNICEF ambassadors. Which means that their voices count. Also not to mention that they are on Times cover this month, with important people such as Kylian Mbappe or Amandla Stenberg.
my father watched the documentary and saw the UN speech, he was amazingly surprised and said "that's really good", I never felt this proud of @BTS_twt
Its not bad. But I'd love they talk more about the boys music and lyrics how it effets on Army. And more detail about the UN speech #BTS #66minutes
We love them being happy for bts and bts getting invited to a France and Korean event that’s to show Korean culture and to be the first ones to be able to perform there infront of governors and presidents and also to have a speech at the UN and the First Lady smiling and + pic.twitter.com/HTtvHeAeXe
alexa play bts' speech at the un
@DIGICELJamaica hey do you know BTS? International superstars no.1 on billboard hot 200, the group that sold out citifield in less than 30 minutes, that gave an amazing speech at the UN and promotes self love with UNICEF #ENDviolence there music is very inspirational #BTSonDMusic
comparing bts’ UN speech to 25 daesangs? Don’t pls be unserious here. A whole ass United Nationd speech, pls rest. pic.twitter.com/6ZBUukUFjJ
Let me give a quick breakdown of what a small action like wearing this shirt could cause huge problems. BTS just went to the UN and made a speech in front of nations. The message was about love (mainly self-love). They are the face of K-Pop around the world. https://twitter.com/hereforbaetae/status/1056564215882739713 …
EXO HAS 25 DAESANGS AND ............... NOTHING BTS HAVE DAESANGS,2ALBUM ON #1 BB200,GRAMMY,AGT,SPEECH FOR UN,COVER FOR TIME GLOBAL EDITION,MERIT CULTURAL AWARD,KMA,etc,etc,etc. ARMYs: pic.twitter.com/ZnV7FkKhEd
sweetie, bts don’t need daesangs when they had an UN speech, a worldwide recognization they are toping the charts at each comeback and they beat their own record cause no one can :(( BTS>> daesangs
I would love to listen a BTS cover of MCR’s SING! It’s just perfect for them! Matches perfectly with Nanjoon’s UN speech.
Every moment is the best for me. But the UN speech has a special place in my heart. After hearing RM's UN speech, I feel grateful. Even for all the hardship and hate that they received in the past because that pains are also what make them today. I feel like whatever hater may+
Even though i am proud of their every single achievement but the UN speech and the order of cultural merit award made me feel prouder than eveeeerrrrr
Just in 2018 BTS has topped the BB 200 chart twice in a row, Grammy museum, sold out stadium in the US, speech at UN, TIME, performed in front of two presidents and now the youngest recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit medal.
Yesterday while I was at the wedding I introduced five people to bts, even got two of them to watch the un speech and showed them different songs and they got very interested. I feel accomplished
i showed my mom rm's speech at un and told her that bts helped me a lot. after she finished watching the speech,she said that they worked hard to get this far and told me to be like them
BTS wasn't trained to make a speech at the UN assembly, but look where we are :,^)
#AskLiza When did you encountered @BTS_twt ? Is it here or YT? And how long you’ve been checking them out? Did you see their UN speech? Thank you!
so u tellin me that i saw where the king and president rm gave his iconic speech?? and bts was seriously all here?? i went to the UN... i love powerful men #BTSxUnitedNations #speakyourself @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/s6RjXogDVv – at United Nations
I just wanted to bring the UN speech back a little because Namjoon continues to inspire me everyday, especially with his words #bts #김남준 #BTSCulturalMeritMedalpic.twitter.com/jhR6nj0uFu
so folks i talked to my mum about bts a little bit. I told her about the new campaign they started with UN and about their UN speech and the order of cultural merit. My mum said she read about them on the newspaper and she called them small kids lmao
Some saint posted the full version on Namjoon’s #UN speech on Souncloud and I have already listened to it four times today. #speakyourself @BTS_twt

"At their UN speech, as part of their partnership with @UNICEF’s new initiative, Generation Unlimited, leader Kim Namjoon (RM) urged young ppl to "SPEAK YOURSELF”. This speech is just another step in @BTS_twt’ LONG HISTORY of SPEAKING FOR, TO & ABOUT this NEW GENERATION." pic.twitter.com/q8spEsvQdn
sorry, english isn't my main language. r u going to shame me for that? can you stop expecting from the world to speak fluently? are you making fun of bts members when they also made mistake in english? how did you felt when the tv host laughed at joon's english in his UN speech.
@RevRichardColes hope you can listen to #mono by RM one of the mbrs of bts (the one who gave the un speech) the lyrics are beautiful and healing. https://youtu.be/G9ntaxClfrA https://youtu.be/Cvb76hBX_Oc https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/sets/rm-mono-2018 …

I can't believe I really participated in this Korean speaking contest. 3 years ago Becky is shaking. Special thanks to @BTS_twt if it wasn't for them I probably wouldn't have gained the courage to do this. Especially Namjoons speech at the UN moved something in me #speakyourself
You are cute too oppa *smiles* and congratulations by the way on the success of bts UN speech your american and europe concert and for getting a big award in arts and culture too and hope your foot is okay now
@BTS_twt just did a speech in the @UN, one of my friends just met AMINA Mohammed the deputy secretary general of the UN .. WHAT SOULD I DO TO GO TO THE UN ?
BTS: *drops 2 albums, drops a another album n a single 2 days after, gives us a world tour, bv3, UN speech, Graham Norton, interview with grammys museum, Burn The Stage, gets Order of Merit medal, keeps us updated on twitter* BTS: *doesn't post for 3 days* ARMYs: I miss them :(
You may ignore this& don't believe me but i came home few days ago after finishing my last exam feeling drained when my mom hand me this paper. A paper where RM's UN speech was printed. She told me some girls were talking abt it & she asked for a copy to give me @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/BcsMcoTwSV
BTS is a band that has 7 members. They’ve won lots awards and have even given a speech at the UN. They held two concerts in London in october and all 40,000 tickets sold out in a matter of minutes. Their music is inspirational and contains a lot of meaning for so many people.
Really appreciated what you have mentioned/tweet/reply about PeckPalit and his fans. I love your perception and about asian artist in global music industry. I also respect to BTS became the first K-pop group to deliver a speech at the UN, what an amazing and touching moment.

wait SO WHEN BTS GETS THE GLOBAL ARTIST AWARD AT THE MMA THEYRE MOST LIKELY TO MAKE A VIDEO OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE UN SPEECH WILL BE INCLUDED AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON WATCHING IT WILL SEE IT IMAGINE HOW GIGGLY AND SHY JOON WOULD GET https://twitter.com/producerknj/status/1055949712006807553 …
RM’s UN speech, “No-one called out my name, and neither did I … But I had one sanctuary, and that was music." #BTS
My mom made me tear up a bit tonight again. We were talking about Joon’s UN speech and BTS’ achievements this year, and she said this: pic.twitter.com/vazgna3IOm
By the end of the day, #RM is still human. He said in his UN speech that he is starting to love himself little by little. He is the leader. 'N still young. All the pressures are in him. Let's give him back the love that he truly deserve. He has given so much already. @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/JK_Glitters/status/1055677071240978432 …
Anyone: Bts stans: okay but did you know bts released 10 albums this year, 20 mixtapes, 100 music videos, and 30 collabs? Oh AND they won 80 awards and gave a speech at the UN event
LMAOOOOO zero impact my as*. Our Order of Merit 5th Class and UN speech with the endless shows playing BTS songs and hosts mentioning them says hi!!!
+ So the middle school decided to put a link to the youtube video to @BTS_twt speech at the UN because of the similar theme (the whole entire speech). Then after that, his star teacher got curious who BTS is then made the whole class watch #FakeLove with her (indluding my bro XD)
That was the best school project I have ever done ~~ #BTS theme is the best ~~ @PinkuYamazaki . . I ALSO SHOWED MY CLASSMATES NAMJOON SPEECH AT UN *^* pic.twitter.com/QVXuVNMCFI
I’ve accidentally seen part of the ”report” on BTS’ speech at the UN made by Q/uotidien and yeah, it was as shitty as I expected :)) (which was why I hadn’t watched it last month) (and I really wasn’t missing out) (hell, I used to watch them but haven’t in months, for good reason
Bitch I laugh so hard, visuals super stars lmao give awards for these? I’m sorry museum of Grammys, #1 in BB200x2 I’m sorry Unicef ambassadors, UN speech, cover of the most important magazine of the world, TIME, cultural merit for expanse the SK culture and language! pic.twitter.com/pPBHa5P3Gz
bts hates dark skin your love is one sided — lol watch namjoon’s un speech. they don’t rate racists x https://curiouscat.me/rkivegloss/post/688967484?1540577652 …
and the specific malicious haters are ARMYS . Yes BTS's ARMYS, majority of them are telling that they are ARMYS .. @BigHitEnt kindly teach your boyzh*t proper decorum . Facing in front of many people and having a speech in UN but their fandom cant even behave .
i’m watching the behind of the UN speech and i’m really struggling sartorially 1) people whose necks are long enough to have your collars zipped up all the way...what’s that like 2) BTS. YOU ARE WALKING UPRIGHT AT THE UN. BUTTON YOUR GODDAMN SUIT JACKETS pic.twitter.com/IvKCNW3N7I
So I just saw the UN Behind Episode and as soon as Namjoon finished his speech I felt the urge to run to him to hug him and tell him just how proud I am of him. @BTS_twt
We know that only korean realises are going to be supported by k army so it's not surprising apart that BTS attached gp attention with UN speech, stadium concert, order of merit and France Party....
Damn i finally got to listen to his speech.. Damn the speech is wonderfulListen to BTS SPEECH at UNICEF Youth 2030 The UN Youth Strategy.mp3 by hanifa rahmi #np on #SoundCloudhttps://soundcloud.com/hanifa-rahmi/bts-speech-at-unicef-youth …
My mom used to not care about them a long time ago until recently when i went to the concert and when i let her see joon’s UN speech.. she’s prolly seen how they’re such a good role model and motivator to me im so proud
Sorry but BTS is the first and only 5 yo gp to have 2 bbmas, AMA, kma, cultural merit visited and performed at the popular American shows, Grammy museum, gave a speech at the UN etc.. we’re already proud of their achievements and they keep doing better & better every year
ur logic doesn't make sense. both groups achieved lots of great things. for example, bts did a speech at the UN. exo performed for the closing ceremony for the olympics. we stan different groups. i get that you should be proud but dont use it to bring other groups or people down
yeah this is the same @BTS_twt that had a speech in UN https://twitter.com/firtsIove/status/1055636613852737537 …
Yup... The same man with IQ of 148 who gave an impressive speech at the @UN conference on behalf of @UNICEF ... The leader and strength of @BTS_twt and #BTSARMY We love you #RM ... Keep being unapologetically you. #WasteItOnMe #WasteItOnMeNow #monohttps://twitter.com/relijoon/status/1055529613064060928 …
we discussed bts' message of loving yourself and watched some lyric videos and their un speech and me being me, i was smiling all through out and shed a few tears during the un speech aaa ^-^
Now please don't compare a UN speech and order of cultural merit to your awards please.
When BTS teach us to love ourselves. Their speech at UN inspires ppl to become their better selves, to stand up for themselves. Just sayin you say my fav taught us to bully ppl, you are actually accusing bts right here sayin they teach ppl to bully others when they dont.
Yeah, can always swap between phone and camera and edit all into a whole video...but now I’m really curious about the camera at the UN speech, he could’ve took photos but it can also be some videos we just have to wait an see
When I’m struggling with french I just think about RM giving a speech at the UN with a language he learned and that’s not his mother tongue in front of leaders from all around the world, and you have no idea of how encouraged and inspired I get. You’re truly my blessing, @BTS_twt
Guess whaaaat~? We just had our test in Social Studies (AP in my country) and I almost screamed cuz one of the questions were: “What is the name of the South Korean group who gave a speech on self love and youth empowerment in the UN Assembly?” AAAAAAAAA YES BTS lezgo
"These faults and mistakes are what I am—making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life." - RM UN speech (and also similar to the lyrics in Anser: Love Myself. Born to be Sad, Sad Suffer to be Glad, Glad. - Moonchild, RM @bts_twt
Omg they included a slide talking about BTS. Included a snippet of Namjoons UN speech. I'm so proud. I told her about them and she used it for her presentation.
Kim Namjoon from BTS. Did you see his UN speech?
Thank you. My ten year old son brought tears to my eyes when I played him the UN speech and he understood the meaning. "Oh I get it mom RM is telling us to love ourselves and to speak about ourselves and it's ok to mess up" yes son yes. :') pic.twitter.com/FTUaWFlYB3
seeing the locals refer to bts as the “UN guys” make me so happy like being remembered by giving a speech there and making a change is fucking amazing
just saw a comment saying they started stanning bts because of joon’s UN speech. HIS IMPACT

you know when bts do something that moves people like the UN speech or namjoon's mixtape and you have those people like "how fake deep i wasn't touched by that in the slightest " ok......now what? do you want a medal?
Yes! Remember the UN speech? Only RM delivered the speech but it was for BTS. We should love and support whatever the boys do. Even if you hear just 2-3 voices.
"BTS's MESSAGE ~ which ultimately boils down to LOVING YOURSELF ~ is positive & optimistic... This HOPEFUL note put @BTS_twt at places rarely reached by pop stars, such as the @UNICEF anti-violence campaign & a speech given at the UN." https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
Our headlines also showcase the ways in Korean culture is permeating America, we discuss the new show on @HBO with @waytooserious and @thegretalee, @scooterbraun and his new KPop project, and @bts_bighit @BTS_twt RM's recent speech at the @UN and @UNICEF!
“Oh you think he’s cute? CHECK OUT THEIR NEW SONG, NEW ALBUM, THEIR UN SPEECH, THEY’RE SUPER TALENTED AND WONDERFU-“ I think they just said they were attractive homegirl, don’t pressure them into liking Bts it’s not that deep... for them at least.
so in the past month BTS has given a speech at the UN, sold out citi field, performed in front of president moon jae-in, received a cultural merit, released a new song with Steve Aoki and NJ’s FREE mixtape became the korean album with most #1 on iTunes antis how y’all holdin up? pic.twitter.com/pDi61Ae096
They are still mad at him for starting that UN speech ,when they weren't there yet ksskskssk
That's Kim Namjoon aka RM the leader and rapper of BTS, you should listen to his new mixtape mono that he just released a few days ago, he's a great rapper, songwriter and also human being, he gave an amazing and inspiring speech at the UN last month https://open.spotify.com/album/0XqAZHNx0xJDObehTI2587?si=GwZWVwKDQC-Z4pSFoXHhXw …
BTS OWNED 2k18 • BV3 • MONO • Hope World • UN SPEECH • US/EU/KOREA tour • Face Yourself • Ly tear & answer • ALL THE AWARDS • Cultural Merit Medal • Burn The Stage Movie • several tv appearances • Meeting president moon • FakeLove/AirplanePt.2 Jp • #WasteItOnMe
You know how parents love to brag about their children? Can you imagine being friends with bts' parents? Like you just can't win, like "oh my son just got hired at a nice company" them "oh that's nice, my son just gave a speech at the UN"
All of them had an amazing year!!! BTS - collaboration with Nicki Minaj, performing at the France-korea summit, meeting the president, UN speech, World Tour sold out and recieving the #BTSCulturalMeritMedal Black Pink - released their mini album + ddu ddu ddu who doesn't -
Hunty, ikon is in yg, so, BTS is literally on tv these days for breathing, everyone and their mama knws who BTS is how much impact they have had, UN speech, concert with the president, merit award(only group ever awarded), having an impact on korean economy etc that's impact sis
so you’re tryna tell me joon practiced and spoke his speech at the UN, produced and released his whole playlist, was on tour with bts, attended a whole bunch of events with them, and had time to sing in Steve Aoki’s song with jungkook?!?!?
And also the least you could do after bts giving you , Run, LY Tear, Answer FY, Bon Voyage, world tour, attending multiple tv shows, UN speech, order of merit Is actually support them they give us so much and if we're pressed about it shows ur support https://twitter.com/jhswave/status/1055455563121938434 …
Oh btw to all those who kept complaining about it being labeled bts and not rm and jk, they should take a look at the comment section. A lot of wondering who bts is or they've heard of them from their UN speech. Yall smell that? MARKETING
how did joon havr the time to write waste it on me, produce and write mono and bts songs, tour, practice for un speech, do comebacks, film variety shows, prepare simple vocabs for his members for interview and he never once show that he is tired of this #WasteItOnMeNow
I’m being completely honest I love different groups but @BTS_twt is truly owning this year. Especially with becoming more popular in the US, their bt21 line, albums, mixtapes, tv performances/guest appearances, the UN speech,AND achievements/awards ! https://twitter.com/KevanKenney/status/1055131044746326016 …
this month BTS has had european tour, burn the stage trailer, bv3, UN speech, graham norton, event in paris to meet the president, dropped mono, attended an award show in korea n today, y’all are really complaining about the song? #WasteItOnMeNowpic.twitter.com/ghZyraRR6e
namjoon did the speech in UN but that was reflected as BTS speech...point is UNLESS otherwise specified by BH(ex. mono), every member's project is BTS.. lastly, where is the official link to this bop? i feel guilty listening to an uploaded version... #wasteitonme ...my spotify
a few days ago, the BTS did: -Concerts in many countries -Appreciated by the president -SPEECH IN UN -Events in France * sorry I forgot the name -RM mixtape:') -Some videos from RM mixtape
bt21 has talent, influential, models for brands, has visuals. what can bts do? ugh, sing? rap? dance? model? act? influence the whole world? continuously chart? win awards and daesangs? give a UN speech? meet the president? receive cultural merit awards? ugh clapped group
Suga: It’s an honor to our family. There have been many things happened this year. From #1 Billboard 200, BBMAs, AMAs to speech at UN, and among them, this medal is such a huge honor. We will spread Korean music as we are nation’s representatives. #BTS #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/Mp8A8u1h27
Its been a month since @BTS_twt 's speech for UN yet here i am, still not over @how beautiful the speech is
BTS having European tour, the UN SPEECH, Graham Norton, Meet ups with presidents, Joon's Mono, attend an award show in Korea and bts x steve ioki and is still busy. BTS BE LIKE 'WHAT IS REST' AND HERE WE ARE EXHAUSTED TRYING TO COPE UP WITH THEIR BUSY-NESS
bts is literally the only one that can be justified, grammy museum, un speech, billboard music award 2 years in a row, so idk why we’re voting here https://twitter.com/KevanKenney/status/1055131044746326016 …
bts have so much theyre doing all at once like.....this new collab, the world tour, the UN speech, award shows LIKE THE FUCK! DO THEY HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
So ARMY, if you encounter people who have prejudice against @BTS_twt, show them the UN speech or share that speech to any social media accounts you have. Let them understand why we stan them. Explain why they are creating such a big change in the world.
But all of those perceptions changed when she saw Joon's speech at the UN. From that, she decided to look up about who @BTS_twt really are. She was amazed and told me that she had nothing but respect for these young men.
#BTSARMY! To commemorate this amazing year for @BTS_twt & to follow-up on RM's amazing speech @the UN, we'll be including #SpeakYourself section in our future editions!

the biggest thing that happened to bts is their UN Speech, like imagine a kpop boy group did THAT
Imagine thinking bts didn’t do the most this year with 2 japanese releases, a full album, a record breaking repackage, a solo work, 2 collabs, the UN speech, the billboards, the amas, and I’m gonna stop here even tho there’s much more to add.
RT Armys__Crew: This year BTS won 4 Daesang, 75 awards, got 3 gold RIAA, got double platinum RIAJ, 2 gold RIAJ gained 3.4B views over 4.5M albums sales & two #1 album, Top10 on BB performed at BBMAs & biggest us TV shows Grammy Museum,gave a speech at the UN &received #BTS…
Here's a beginers guide as to why BTS are conqueering the world written in april 2018 before they topped Billboard, before UN speech, before the sold out concerts. https://www.google.com.ph/amp/s/amp.rappler.com/entertainment/music/200401-things-to-know-kpop-group-bts …
Obviously BTS had ruled 2018 with two #1 album on bb200, 4.5m album sales, 3 gold RIAA, performed at the 2018 BBMAs, Grammy Museum interview, gave an inspirational speech at the UN and received #CulturalMeritMedal just today. This ain't even all of it
Namjoon's been claimed as lead singer of BTS in my country as well since the UN speech jskslsksl https://twitter.com/AureliaOT7/status/1055301117075247109 …
2018 aint even over but BTS have received 4,5M sales, 2 gold RIAA, 2 platinum RIAJ, 2 #1 bb200,a cultural merit medal, a speech at UN General Assembly, 88 #1 itunes for a free mixtape, if its not BTS than idk who more deserves than them https://twitter.com/KevanKenney/status/1055131044746326016 …
i’m listening to bts songs on soundcloud and the damn un speech just came on i-
Tbh I’ve had some irls who have told me they realized why I like BTS so much after the UN speech.

hi high school can C H O K E because i’ve been in that miserable place for like the majority of all recent bts releases or accomplishments like hope world, mono, the un speech, the cultural merit medal thing like fuck off high school honestly
This is so sweet. My dad always ask me about the boys when he reads news about them. He knows about the UN speech and when saw Jimin, Kookie and Tae cry at the concerts, he asked me why and if they were ok I hope your dad is doing well, send you hugs and greetings from Peru.
Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/M87hjb1JvpY?a FULL HD BTS Receiving and Acceptance Speech at Korean Popular Culture & Art
So I wrote half a page explaining who BTS is and I wasn’t even halfway done with what I wanted to say I didn’t have time. Anyway, I explained who they were, their UN speech, the Love Myself campaign, their music achievements, and possible Grammy nominations @BTS_twt
They broke the YouTube record for most views within 24 hours with Idol, received 74 awards this year alone including a BBMA and an AMA. Aside from musical achievements Namjoon also made a speech at the 74th UN GA about youth speaking their truths and identities.
RM, he really out there influencing alot of people to speak themselves.. while listening to a TED talk, Casey Brown said “One thing i shared, is to FIND YOUR OWN VOICE” Reminds me of RM’s speech in the UN. Amazing. @BTS_twt
deep how it’s been a month since the UN speech but bts do so much that’s hard to keep track of when stuff happens
BTS is only 5 years old and look how far they've gotten. They're the biggest boy band worldwide. They even had a speech at the UN. I wonder what opportunity they'll get in 2026!!! There's a lot more coming our way army.. #BTS #BTSCulturalMeritMedal
SUGA @BTS_twt This is an honor to my family.Thankyou so much. So much happened this year from #1onBillboard,'Billboard Music Awards,UN speech,but I think the Order of Cultural Merit is the biggest honor.I will spread KoreanMusic to the world w/the mind of a NationalRepresentative pic.twitter.com/xqbWGcd0ay
Deep, we should also live by what we preach. Give others a chance to speak for themselves fully, very meaningful speech at UN.
Finally watching the bangtan bomb about the UN speech and I feel so nervous even though I know how it works out. Our Joonie did amazing @BTS_twt
I have to say this tweet is great,thank you,you didn’t know of them but after some research,you do now,they’re 7 amazing,very talented young men(they’re ambassadors for Unicef & this was taken at UN,where RM did a speech) pic.twitter.com/8HS13WyciL
The only time I ever hear kpop stans bring up BTS’ campaign or their UN speech is to sht on armys... can you PLEASE get a life
how did they have a european tour, burn the stage trailer, bv3, the UN SPEECH, graham norton, meet up with the president in paris, drop joons grammy deserving album, attend an award show the minute they land in korea, another bts x steve ioki in one month?? ONE MONTH I NEED AIR
I love how y'all only bring up Namjoon's UN speech and what armys are doing for #ENDviolence when it so something like this. You will never congratulate armys when they donate millions of dollars in all currencie or when they do charitable projects even if they benefit everyone
Honestly @BTS_twt They have achieved so much this year alone! 2 BB200 #1 , #10 on Hot100, Sold out concerts in minutes, BBMA and AMA Top Social Artist, A movie coming out, UN speech, youngest recipient of The Order Cultural Merit from their country, & MANY more..
Kim Namjoon and BTS spoke at the UN last month (Namjoon was self taught from watching the show "Friends") and 3 years ago released a mixtape, and another this Monday UN Speech: https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg 1st mixtape: https://m.soundcloud.com/bangtan/sets/rm-rap-monster … Recent playlist: https://m.soundcloud.com/bangtan/sets/rm-mono-2018 …
Why is there any other option when bts is the only group who has enough achievements to actually own 2018? UN speech?did THAT. Sold out a 50k venue in less than 20 minutes in the US. Invited to the Grammy museum. Also went to every single major western tv show. They made 2018 oof
let’s be real everyone’s in love with joon. that squirrel eating ur pumpkins? it’s in love with joon. ur dog? it’s in love with joon. every soul in bts? in love with joon. the world? in love with joon. watch out bc ur parrot’s about to start reciting his UN speech https://twitter.com/hobiesmalls/status/1054796893304299520 …
Great thread! Some of you are confused about BTS singing in English. It's not selling out. If you think like that, then Namjoon giving his speech in English at the UN was selling out. BTS made it abundantly clear in "IDOL" that they are proud of their Korean identity and culture. https://twitter.com/btbtbtsssssss_/status/1055161408227176448 …
“Yes, this is an honour in my family. Thank you very very much . A lot of things have happened this year. First place on Billboard, the BBMAs, the AMAs, a speech at the UN. This medal is truly an immense honor. (cont) @BTS_twt #BTSCulturalMeritMedalpic.twitter.com/BsFMoEC2fJ
update: so we're listening to everyones sound project in class rn. my teacher asked me about the speech in my project & i explained how bts went to the UN conference a couple of weeks ago & he was shocked he was like "no way really?" he said his english was good & it was deep oof
This year BTS won 4 Daesang, 75 awards, got 3 gold RIAA, got double platinum RIAJ, 2 gold RIAJ gained 3.4B views over 4.5M albums sales & two #1 album, Top10 on BB performed at BBMAs & biggest us TV shows Grammy Museum,gave a speech at the UN &received #BTSCulturalMeritMedal
Very few? how then they trended the HT and included other fandoms in it? They goin' like @/bts see how toxic your fandom is and tagging UN Speech and saying 'like idols, like fan'.. I'm so hurt. I just blocked everyone I see engaging in those and try to stay positive. ++

Sometimes I think about how far BTS has come and all the things they do now, for gid's sake a UN speech and now THIS? The legend did more than just popoed out, they are the definition of legends and none of them are even 30 yet I can't I'm so proud

Billboard No1 twice in an year, UN speech, Youngest recipients of Cultural Merit, CITIFIELD, Grammy Museum, Successful World Tour, Mono, breaking records. The point is BTS DID THAT AND everyone else will be second. #BTSCulturalMeritMedal

IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE THE UN SPEECH.... HOW?!?!? @BTS_twt
it's been a month since I was reborn as a human aka since bts gave their speech at the UN, I will never shut up about how proud they made me by showing what hard work and love and passion can do in the hands of people who care about the world and about people #BTSxUnitedNationshttps://twitter.com/BTS_inmypocket/status/1044320279244214277 …
Now that Bts is safely in korea ,may i share this?? So my frd Called yesterday and told me he is meeting Bts .As I was at work so I don’t had time to describe Bts but he saw UN speech so he know RM ..
Better yet, BTS should do it with all their awards, their UN speech, UNICEF #ENDviolence banner, and, oh wait, also the music industry
also can i just add that my boss heard about BTS and was interested because of namjoon's UN speech. she said that he sounded very smart and he looked good and said that she was impressed since it was v inspiring.
it's been a month since my bts concert and joonie's UN speech :(
Can you believe it has been a month since BTS were at the UN Headquarters giving their speech, it felt like yesterday. Namjoon’s words will forever stick with me, I am so proud of them
She kept on screaming cuz Tae’s shoe lace were untied&she was hoping he would not fall..she was like “pls don’t fall, pls don’t fall”....I’m so happy she watched them without me having to force her...she came to me willingly...She is Joon biased cuz of his speech at UN @BTS_twt
Besides if the answer isn’t BTS please list out what your favs have done this year - UN speech? BBMAs? All the awards they have won this year internationally? Grammy museum? America’s Got Talent? HMU I want to know
THE BTS UN SPEECH WAS A MONTH AGO WHAT
Come back when your faves are able to win a billboard and make a speech at the UN and get on the cover of Time Magazine and become ambassadors for South Korea chosen by the president of South Korea last time I checked BTS had more achievements when it comes to their story pic.twitter.com/vO4ErXqw6a
alright @BTS_twt you boys always stalk twitter I don’t need a response i just want namjoon to know that i am writing my college personal statement with his UN speech as my inspiration - thank you and i hope i make u proud buddy :)
I had a full on panic attack and all it took to calm down was to watch a Jimin VLive and then the speech Namjoon gave at the UN. I am listening to Seoul right now bawling my eyes out from reading comments from people that bts has saved. And u know what. You saved me too @BTS_twt
My dad just called me and he showed me BTS UN speech and he said “look here goes your boys!” And it made me happy because they get to see what type of boy group I stan and why I do.

It's from his UN speech "...shut out my own voice and..."
I keep track of my life by using bts events and it’s been a month since the UN speech and I’ve accomplished NOTHING
are you ever just chilling and then you are hit with the realization that wow, bts is the biggest boy band in the world rn and made a speech at the freaking UN and this is actually the reality we live in?
Now. Lmao. I’m so done with you. you retweeted a comment on this matter when the subtweets under it were doing nothing but trashing the boys, especially their speech at the UN because of a shirt he wore a year ago. How many times do people pull the “they’re human too they-
next bts album skit: un speech
for others. Im just saying that as an idol group who encourage love and as an influential idol who made a speach in UN conference which is a place made in purpose of world peace, they must be responding to this big issue to prove whatever they said in the speech was not ironic-
song and dance for radio and they still paid her dust? Nothing is guaranteed and i think bts is focusing on the right things tbh. And it's not just radio that brings gp awareness, the UN speech was an example of something very out of the box that does that too
can you believe it's been a whole month since bts' speech at the UN.. time flies faster than an eagle sometimes..

I know right and now they’re mocking BTS UN Speech the “we have the best fan in the world” Andra the same time dragging BTS
It doesnt even have to be music related like with the UN speech. BTS are powerful & influential & it shows.

My BTS class went well yesterday btw! None of the kids knew BTS. It was good that way. We watched the whole UN speech and Airplane pt. 2. I told them they sold out the O2 instantly and they were mind blown | #jhope #BTS  #MPN @BTS_twt @NickelodeonBR #monoishere #monopic.twitter.com/otpN8bU7zc
They have to deal with it. This is even an opportunity for BTS because gp knows RM from UN speech. See how #mono and #Answer are doing
I bet you didn't even know you all can get be SUED. S. U. E. D. for what what you did to anyone not just to GD!! Cos you ARMYS keep fighting with other FANDOMS not just with us VIPs. I can't believe what just RM said to his UN speech. Smh.
wtf one local radio just did a report on BTS and it was so good, they talked about their message and their UN speech, even included some audio from it without dubbing over it (they also played a song apparently but I missed that, bless my mum for telling me about this)
I think I’m gonna ask my interpreting’s professor if we can translate Namjoon’s UN speech at our interpreting class, cause everyone should hear it #BTS @BTS_twt
My mom just told me she saw an article in one of her magazines about BTS but she can't remember which one! And of course she didnt read it so idek what it was about exactly (their tour, the UN speech?...)
#mono is still number one in the US on iTunes! I can’t believe it! Joon really did that! It’s a totally different style from every other BTS release- after his UN speech, he probably has so many new listeners! I’m so proud of him! pic.twitter.com/RqXDlMX3It
this year really has been amazing. we had hope world, tear, face yourself, answer, mono,, and then on top of that the bbmas, countless interviews and vlives, a world tour and a un speech...and i’m beyond grateful and completely in awe. thank you @BTS_twt, we love you. pls rest<3

Everyone is talking about the moon making theories. all I can think of is RM's speech at the UN @BTS_twt

I've been itching to voice out my opinion about smth related to Joonie's UN speech, BTS mesage of self-love and speaking one's self which are apparently being linked to a sensitive issue. Idk how to put them in words. It is really frustrating.

Buy your playlist mono. by RM, the leader of BTS on iTunes today. If you liked his UN Speech, then you will love his album playlist. @BTS_twt #RMgavemeMono
Can't believe namjoon wrote mono while working on all the BTS albums in the past 3 years and the UN speech and touring and performing and writing us cute/thoughtful messages in fancafe and just genuinely bumbling through life's up and downs he is the most best human ive ever met
I’m watching the BTS UN GA Behind and I’m not over the fact that I was able to watch them live and listen to RM’s speech.
The speaker in the UN speech is Kim Namjoon/RM, the guy in the post above. He's the leader of BTS and was self taught in English. in the speech he said he made mistakes, he has but educated himself and matured. This playlist is a reflection of it all https://m.soundcloud.com/bangtan/sets/rm-mono-2018 …
namjoons parents must be so proud of him, like he’s really out here the leader of bts, having his songs #1 on bb200 TWICE, giving a speech at the UN with so much more and now his own music getting #1 in over 80 countries
@BTS_twt I know Joon will never see this tweet- but I just want to tell you namjoon that you did such a great job.

I am gonna put Namjoon whole UN speech as my caption next time I upload my picture on Instagram cause my legend and president and idol is a true intellectual and the whole world need to know the message he is sending. @BTS_twt
Leader of the group BTS, The guy who had the right of 3 minutes speech at the UN but gave a 6 minutes one because his speech is better than the president's himself
85+ #1’s with a completely self produced and written album, leader of the biggest most influential group in the world, has writing credits for almost all of BTS’ discography, recently gave a speech at the UN....Who is doing it like mr Kim Namjoon?? pic.twitter.com/1A7biqxcsT
IT'S gonna be the 2 intertwined as one symbolizing what he said in his UN speech. "I AM KIM NAMJOON, RM OF BTS". Showing that he finally accepts that there both him. That's my opinion. #monoishere
And in turn the tour obviously, but esp the UN speech, was great timing for mono. It’s like a waterfall, though with BTS there’s obv almost always something going on.
Hey @BTS_twt we’re doing a project on how to love ourselves inspired by your speech at the UN.Can you please send us Namjoon’s drafts cause your lyrics are too poetic for us? Thanks @petalyooniepic.twitter.com/dI8KTXY4uh
We are thankful for #BTS And not to forget the UN speech and encouraging words thank you pic.twitter.com/zX6u4nZyD8
I told her to watch the UN speech first & if she needs translations to their songs, I’ll send her some. Like Yoongi said “You’ll like BTS music if you listen without prejudice.” pic.twitter.com/5YfGdGAmGY
I’m so happy joon was able to fully let go of his RM persona & show the world Kim Namjoon Through RM, reflection, love, the UN speech & now mono he’s shown his journey of discovering who he is & accepting his alter ego RM of BTS but also showing he’s also Namjoon #mono @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt #RM #MONO is for everyone no matter what ur skin color is, ur gender identity. We all can relate. Told y'all his speech in UN has connection with his playlist. His speaking himself through MONO. So proud of u KIM NAMJOON. I LOVE U
one of my classmates was asking about bts because I was telling my friend about mono and said she wants to listen to bts since i told her about UN speech and LY series she thought they were so sweet and instead of saying bts was pretty she instead said they looked caring. im-
Seriously...when did Namjoon have time to create such a masterpiece? He is working on BTS music, prepare for a tour, going on tour, doing BTS promo stuff...casually giving a speech at the UN. & now he drops this creation? H.O.W??? Kim Namjoon snaps! @BTS_twt #monoishere #RMono
21.10.2018 I attended an ARMY meet today!!! I met wonderful ARMYs. We did fanchants, saw GCF Saipan, UN speech and MVs. We cut a cake for Jimin's bday celebration! It was lovely. @BTS_twt
Moonchild reminds me of his UN speech where he said how he used to look up at the night sky and how he had the dreams of a boy and that he wanted to become a superhero and I cry #monoishere @BTS_twt
#monoishere I'm over the moon y'all. This album is indescribable .. @BTS_twt RM completed the tour successfully, gave a heartfelt speech at the UN, attended Grammy, AGT and so many more events and he made this along the way. So thankful for this <3 #monoplaylistprojectpic.twitter.com/XFvo1Oj9W7
the pressure of producing us good and inspiring songs. Namjoon-ah oppa, thank you so so so much. You've not just inspire me by your lyrics, but the speech on UN too. I was speechless afterwards, I just suddenly feel like I've been awaken again although I'm already- #MonoIsHere
I HATE NAMJOON HE'S SO TALENTED, HE CAN PRODUCE MUSICS WHILE STUDYING ON HIS UN SPEECH AND DOING A WORLD TOUR AT THE SAME TIME I HATE HIM @BTS_twt #monoishere
im thinking ... namjoon wrote and produced mono all while touring, writing and producing for bts, filiming run/burn the stage, music videos, learning choreo, practicing for an UN speech .... his work ethic is unmatched
Mono reflects Namjoon's UN speech. Be true to yourself, speak yourself. Thank you Namjoon @BTS_twt #monoishere
@BTS_twt i get inspired by ur speech thanks to your UN’s speech i can get into debate line and go go to city competition thank youuuuuuuuu
I can’t believe he was preparing the playlist WHILE doing LY albums, tour practices, Summer package filming, the UN speech...meanwhile I can’t even decide if I should get out of bed on the weekend we Stan forever #MonoIsHere @BTS_twt
Kim Namjoon. This man literally oozes creative genius, and even after two albums, two japanese albums, world tour, music/award shows,filming, mv's, adverts,UN speech , he STILL had time to create this high-quality playlist ~ We stan such a talented musician #monoishere @BTS_twt
Yes, and mention their UN speech, their UNICEF campaign or just the fact that they write and produce their own music (and would never get fired for drinking beer ).
Hobi was so supportive of Namjoon at the UN speech. Did you see him whisper something after he did it? I think he was saying ‘well done’ | #jhope #BTS⁠ ⁠ #MPN @BTS_twt @NickelodeonBRpic.twitter.com/h3ojdbtZz8
Our Filipino group manager went to Korea for a training and guess what is the giveaway item after training???? It's LOVE YOURSELF Album. Not sure if it's HER or ANSWER though. He knew BTS because of it. He knew that BTS gave a speech in UN and had a campaign UNICEF @BTS_twt
I think it was an ok segment with some mistakes (no big surprise about that) - they didn't even mention that BTS wrote and produced their own songs, the Europe tour and UN speech! But I am happy that BTS was on #GoMorgenDanmark It was an okay beginning for K-pop to break into DK.
His reaction tho! #Jimin #BTS #UN #Speech https://twitter.com/StacieG719/status/1054147877033992194 …
Lol I have been scanning through their past interviews and the UN speech for clue words that might be the song title but with these guys it could be anything TvT)b I just know there's a purpose behind the different font size and placement.
I've been reading the #manga Promised Neverland after @hitmanb tweeted about it. And this part brought me to tears. Reminded me of Namjoon's UN speech. @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/hitmanb/status/1029394711771922433 …pic.twitter.com/6UvtZ4VeIC

30. when were u most proud of bts? UN speech and all the things they do to make world better
ok but why jungkook was so jungshoocked during the UN speech training thang? hauheauehaueha he was having the worst trip ever i can't even breathe @BTS_twt
it's from the latest bts episode which was uploaded yesterday. it's all about their un speech
@btsdanisharmy 8.5 minute long segment, have it all on video. It was okay i think, but didn’t give bts quite enough credit I think and didn’t mention their UN speech sadly
Un speech for 2 secs and didn't featured in the UN news
The speech RM have recently at the UN youth conference if you haven’t had the chance to do so! And BTS Run episodes and their interviews are always great too. You can find lots of them subtitled in English online.
My professor a while ago mentioned BTS because they made a speech in UN. and as expected, he liked it. and you girl, is ready to explain infront about it. i'm just proud. pic.twitter.com/KXN910H3WO
ikr... the fact that they still have the audacity to compare the UN speech with fountain thing is really..... the stupidity jumped out #MPN #BTSARMY #BTS
recite their un speech from memory or ur opinion is invalid

The “BTS Episode” they released yesterday that shows the behind the scenes stuff for there UN speech
Imagine BTS working on a series of self love/acceptance for 2 years and a half because the world has continuously discredited them and giving a speech about it in the UN for their fans to say shit like this. The bandwagon jumped out. pic.twitter.com/IwztPxUD2Q
i used to talk about them prior to the un speech so he recognized the name bts
Thank you @BTS_twt Namjoon You invested so much time, energy and thoughts into your UN speech. Without you there'd truly be nothing. I purple you so so much!
I made my aunt watch namjoon's UN speech and she got all teary-eyed. I, then, proceeded to make her watch an "RM making BTS laugh" compilation afterwards, pointing every now and then saying "that's the guy who did the speech"

I find it hilarious that Joonie can get a whole mixtape together while touring around the world, giving a speech at the UN, doing interviews and all that jazz. And then there’s me, who CaN’t EvEn WriTE ONE EFfiNG PaPerrrr @BTS_twt
So RM was working on these while touring and giving UN speech? Do you sleep? Ever?
Can’t wait to listen!! After watching you practice so hard for your UN speech, you’ve motivated me to work hard and I want to listen carefully and appreciate every song and lyric to your mixtape once it comes out
seeing namjoon work so hard and the others encourage and support him is so heartwarming :( the un speech was so inspiring and powerful . it was absolutely amazing and im so happy that the message was to speak yourself its just . so so empowering and wonderful. i adore bts pic.twitter.com/LyBPyN35tG
I FEEL SO EXCITED. I even got more excited when I found out that my dad knows BTS and that he WATCHED THE UN SPEECH AND HE SAID THAT NAMJOON's SPEECH WAS GOOD BISH MY DAD APPROVES //brick'd #monoTOMORROW

WOW MY DAD KNOW ABOUT BTS AND HE WATCHED THE UN SPEECH I AM PROUD
this morning, i was at the kitchen when my mom told me “hey, i saw the UN speech by the BTS leader and wow, now i understand why many people admire them and why you love them so much. They stay humble even tho they’re basically worldwide celebrity. That’s why they are bless.”
4)BTS pinned their first tweet but unpinned it later 5) BH dropped a bangtan bomb on the UN speech
Yeah, we know what to do pic.twitter.com/Zt9Xd7PbDi
@BTS_twt members were saying Namjoon looked really good at the UN Assembly and during his speech, like an activist or politician. Hobi legit said to us "Don't you wish you could see him in real life?" Jihope turned to eo and laughed bcs Armys never will I hate them! pic.twitter.com/7I1J7JkNwB
You did a great job at the UN speech RM @BTS_twt i cried while watching it and it felt so good watching you guys that day! https://twitter.com/imjungshook/status/1053925304018853888 …
I sent her the link of the UN speech and said BTS music is self written and discuss mental illness, social issues, and politics. I may just make an IRL army friend by New Years omg.
bts have set my standards so high. you haven't done a speech at the UN? next.
Lol, haters keep saying "BTS ArE TreNd" since 2016. Now its almost end of 2018 and here they are selling million of album, winning award, successful world tour, UN speech, time magazine, fandom kept growing.

I just watched the BTS EPISODE of the UN speech & wow! You guys have no idea how proud I am of them, specially of Namjoon. He’s such a great leader and seeing him prepare so much for this and also how much the group love and respect him makes me even more happy being an army
Mono is RM playlist and release is in about 24 hr, BTS was on a billboard in LA and a hastage trended about it, also behind the scenes of the UN speech came out. Hope you get caught up
I wanna hug namjoon so bad each time i see people/bts mention he was shaking badly during his UN speech im so proud of namjoon really His nervousness didnt even show onscreen on that day
@BTS_twt Namjoon I just want to tell you again that you gave a beautiful speech at the UN and I’m so so proud of you and the others
Even with your extremely busy schedule, you gave us Vlives, you shared your moments with us, did interviews and UN speech along with the one in France in front of Korea s President So thank you for your hardwork #WeGotTheBestOfYou @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/vc8BOttp1w

hey, joon! these past few months and weeks have been wild. i wanna say that you did amazing. your un speech is something i think about everyday. your masterpiece, mono, will be dropping soon, and i cant wait to hear it. i always love listening to your voice and to your stories
can we talk about how hard working namjoon is he’s been creating new music for bts, preparing for comebacks, learning new choreo, preparing for a speech at the UN, doing so many western interviews while on a worldwide tour, all the while he was creating his own mixtape #RMmonopic.twitter.com/48jACs5UAi

Ask them to write a 2 pages speech in not the mother tongue Can she/he presented it without reading and memorise it??? And in UN in front of worlds influential ppl
I notice in today bts episode, jk in the one that most excited. He must be SO excited about un speech and so proud of joon. LIKE MY HEART HURT SO MUCH WHY HE IS SO CUTE https://twitter.com/choi_bts2/status/1053956944002596864 …

Namjoon really worked so hard for him to DELIVERED HIS UN SPEECH AMAZINGLY, AND HE REALLY DID. HOW CAN I EVEN THANK THIS MAN PERSONALLY LIKE EVEN IN MY DREAMS IF POSSIBLE, LET ME PLEASE @BTS_twt
can we all take a moment to just appreciate how much effort namjoon put into his un speech and the stress he was going through to deliver it in the best way possible. truly he has more of a presidential attitude than all of the current presidents combined @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/CO1ttChGrf
Woke up this morning stressed out because of a meeting I have to coordinate and lead today. And then I saw that @BTS_twt's UN video had come out, so I watched that first. I'm not stressed anymore. If RM can memorize a speech in English for the UN, I run one tiny meeting...
This Bangtan bomb was so great. I love watching #BTS get ready for the UN speech. You could see how important and meaningful it was to every single one of them. I think we all look forward to even more philanthropy and humanitarian work from them as they get older. @BTS_twt

So uhhhh I just had a thought. Although we know RM’s UN speech is kinda related to the BTS albums, do y’all think he’s gonna have some lines related to it in his playlist? Hmm. Or if he does put lyrics related to the speech, would they strictly be in the albums...
Gosh!! This episode brought back all the UN memories. I'm glad that I could relive all those moments again. And Namjoooooonnnn, god! He was so nervous but still delivered the speech like a true LEADER. I'm so proud of them. we stan legends. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/uahsaY5oDo
When I watched the new [Episode] BTS UN General Assembly Behind, for some reason as soon as it started I bawled my eyes out. The fact that that on 9/23 RM was stressed out and rehearsing his speech before the last of concert in Hamilton started. The fact that we were there with
I love how Jungkook was watching RM reahersed his UN speech.. Jungkook really admires RM his very supportive @BTS_twt UN SPEECH

namjoon keep repeating reading the whole speech before speak on UN make me feels like.. boy.. its like u gonna have an examination the struggle of him to make his speech is smooth as he can.. good job RM @BTS_twt
I'm still not over how surreal the concert was, and how it feels like a dream. But then imagine how surreal these last months must've been for BTS, with the UN speech and everything.. it's probably a similar feeling
Harnessing the power of God, Jesus, Satan, memes, bananas and BTS UN's speech to secure a ticket #BTSinSG

Who else cried with me while watching the behind the scenes of BTS in UN General Assembly? I was reminded of that surreal feeling. I remember how proud we were and how we all collectively cried with there speech. I am more than proud to be their fan @BTS_twt
The theme reflection kinds of make me think of Namjoon's UN speech because you have to know where you come from to know where you are going, it all comes down to the knowing yourself, reflecting on your past and who you are.
bts: singers, writers, dancers, composers, producers, have a campaign with unicef, made a speech at the un, extremely hardworking and humble french media: they famous c they pretty lol
The parallels are fascinating. RM's first mixtape documents him having to deal with two conflicting identities. In his UN speech, he seems to accept being both, Kim Namjoon & RM of BTS. And finally, both mixtape & UN speech end with him vowing to never silence his voice @BTS_twt
After the speech, Hoseok whispered to Namjoon for doing great at the UN. You can read Namjoon's lips said 'thank you' in Korea. IMO.
Namjoon literally memorizing his UN speech everywhere nonstop is honestly amazing he’s so diligent and hardworking even beyond his musical talents I’m inspired #BTS
Our Namjoonah worked so hard for the UN speech, seeing him so nervous. You did very well! Your speech truely made me tear up but it was more warm/happy tears cause you just keep inspiring me with every word you say. #방탄소년단 #BTS  #RM #김남준 #Namjoon @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/crXY7c4JVK

let's go over what bts has done in the past 24 hours: • announced a new solo project • finished the second leg of the tour • put up mysterious billboard ads and started a scavenger hunt • might have hinted at a new era • uploaded a behind of the UN speech CAN Y'ALL CHILL

V:First of all I woke up in the morning, and I saw the New York street is very shabang shabang (dazzling)... I feel like that’s why people say New York, New York and like it... we are ok, but RM Hyung should be nervous (looking at him) @BTS_twt UN speech episode pic.twitter.com/fTTmj7IgyJ
it’s content like behind the scenes and this one from the un speech especially that shows how much work and thought bts put into everything they do and it’s a shame that there aren’t subtitles when it can make understanding ten times easier for non-korean speakers
I can't imagine how nervous namjoon must have been during his UN speech. I am so proud of you, namjoon. You did really well. @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt x ARMY Bangtan Episode's From 1st BBMA Win..1st AMA Performance..2nd BBMA and 1st Performance toooo 1st K-Artist Speech in UN Many more Bangtan Episode's to come!!!! #BTS #MPN #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/Zy6DBoBqCU

he really worked so hard for his UN speech, it's his words and his story we're proud of you, Namjoon @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/JM3yfBvZYt
Watching the bts episode of behind the scenes of the UN speech, I can tell you how much prouder I am of them, especially Namjoon, he must’ve been so nervous and wanted to deliver the speech and it’s message flawlessly. #bts @BTS_twt https://youtu.be/JeODXwSenKs
Namjoon rehearsing his speech for the UN every chance he gets our hardworking leader @BTS_twt
I can’t get over how insanely proud I’ll always be of @BTS_twt and Namjoon’s amazing UN speech!!! The behind the scenes vid for it was so cute and I really felt for him since he was so nervous, but he really pulled it off beautifully and I’m so proud of him pic.twitter.com/U9R5WrdLTK
< During meeting prior to UN speech > Suga: Just because they’re the fans of idols they get belittled but they are extraordinary people. This is not something anyone can do just because you like them. (Referring to fans/us supporting them unconditionally ) @BTS_twt #Suga
Ppl, why no subtitles for this one at least, if it's abt the UN speech #BTS menno https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1053918875908136960 …
Thank You so much sharing behind of UN speech. So Proud of all of you. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/6wd4YVL9T4
< During meeting prior to UN speech > RM: With this topic (Love Myself) just telling people story like this and if they (people and fans) can at least think once what it means to love themselves, that itself is sufficient. @BTS_twt #RM
Dear Kim Namjoon, Thankyou for your hardwork to present the best speech ever in the UN. It was my childhood dream to be there, so thankyou for fullfiling my dream. You did a great job pic.twitter.com/S4CFnxy7El
I'm so proud of my boys and especially you Namjoonie ^_^ you were so nervous practicing the UN's speech but u managed to do great ♡ I love you so much Our leader, you are a true blessing! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/DDSGPLzhYz
namjoon practiced a lot for their UN speech IM SO PROUD OF HIM, he delivered the speech amazingly and he really did END IT WITH A LESSON THAT EACH AND EVERYONE IN THE WORLD SHOULD HEAR IN ORDER TO BE INSPIRED AND MOTIVATED IN THEIR LIVES. IM SO PROUD @BTS_twt
They all are one supporting Namjoon! Seeing namjoon is like seeing him for the 1st time get ready for the UN speech i get nervous again but tears falls down after his speech @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/zUY8OeSyHF
the amount of dedication you put into this speech is incredible. i’m so proud of you namjoon. thank you for working so hard for countless hours of the days. you did incredible speaking at the UN. “speak yourself” will always resonate with me. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Sy39YJeUzd
Namjoon was so nervous. Im proud of him for delivering the speech perfectly. I love how the other members showed their support for him. BTS speaking at the UN will forever be my proudest moment as an ARMY... more than all those awards. Not everyone can do it but BTS was able to.

joon practised so frickin hard to perfect his UN speech- he practised before they left, during the flight, after they landed and even before they went into the room and probably countless times in between. I am SO PROUD of him and @BTS_twt for the hard work they constantly put in pic.twitter.com/6XW6WZfg5R
imagine being at the un hq and throwing peace signs out of nervousness in front of world leaders but everyone is so moved by your speech you just gave that they find it endearing. only namjoon and bts can relate
Jungkookie watching Namjoon practicing their UN speech is the greatest uwu ever @BTS_twt #BTS

I’ve listened to namjoon’s UN speech so many times that I feel like I’ve almost have it completely memorized in my head @BTS_twt
Behind the UN speech
guys. i am so proud to be an army. i went to my classmate's house kanina and i was able to talk to her mom and i asked her about what she felt when she watched joon's UN speech [bc she shared it on her fb page] and she said that people like BTS should be the role models +
Go watch the behind the scenes of the un speech and give it a like y’all. #bts @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1053918875908136960 …
ok but a few months ago would you ever have thought we would have a bangtan bomb of bts giving a speech at the un general assembly i can’t believe how good life is
@BTS_twt uploaded their Behind The Scene, when they went to do their speech at UN
Thank you so much BTS for such an inspiring speech at the UN All seven of you have inspired and motivated me so much. I am really grateful to have you guys in my life Borahe!!!
Joon is too cute preparing for the UN speech Baby you did amazing @BTS_twt

OMG BEHIND OF THE UN SPEECH IM IN
#MONO and Namjoon is gonna be the center of attention NO DOUBT ! WE NEED TAGS TRENDING & ENTERING CHARTS !!! IM SAYING EVERYONE WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS ! even my sisters who knows nothing about BTS but they know joon from the UN speech, are looking forward to it. BUY & STREAM !
THIS IS A LIE...NAMJOON DOESN'T SLEEP..HOW ELSE CAN HE MAKE A WHOLE NEW SOLO ALBUM WHILE MAKING MUSIC FOR/AS #BTS, PREPARING UN SPEECH, LEARNING DAD JOKES FROM JIN AND TOURING AROUND THE WORLD WHILE PERFECTING THE ART OF WORDPLAYS AND MEETING HIS FAV ARTISTS? @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/7TBJcKwASc
if the billboard is the combinations of DNA and Wings, which is light and darkness. In the new era are we finally embracing both just like what RM said in his UN speech?!? #TheGreatBTSBillboardHunt #MPN #BTSARMY @BTS_twt #BTS  pic.twitter.com/kl676JGdd3
That’s the problem. It’s the direction the articles take when writing abt the important stuff like with the UN. They talk more abt the fact that they’re the first k-idols to speak instead abt the essence of the speech. Sigh....
Tbh I got baffled that they didn't seen to have a good insight about what the UN actually is. If they don't know the basics how can they understand the importance of the news. (And k-media didn't really help with all the "firts kpop group to give a speech blah blah" headlines)
The only thing that bothered me is how they talked about the UN speech as if it's some kind of stage where they were doing promotions.
I love listening to Namjoon’s UN speech. His voice is just so calming and his message always resonates with me no matter how many times I listen to it @BTS_twt
I feel like BTS is next like albums concept could possibly be speak yourself because they gave us a ginormous clue for Love Yourself within their billboard speech so what's stopping them from doing it and their UN speech
I still keep thinking that their next album is going to be speak yourself cuz after all they put a ginormous clue to love yourself in their billboard speech so what's stopping them from putting clothes in their UN speech
BTS fed us all of these in just 10 months.. J-Hope's mixtape Love Yourself: 'tear' comeback Love Yourself: 'answer' comeback Festa 2018 Bon voyage season 3 bbmas' top social media artist Bts comeback show LY World Tour concert AMAs award UN speech #BTS @BTS_twt
Prediction: Namjoon's UN speech will be in #mono or #BTS 's next album
If BTS not ppular in Korea then why the knetz were very proud when knowing that BTS charted no1 in bb200, gave a speech at UN, the news broadcast on aired stopped suddenly to announced that bts got bbma awards and cabinet meetings in SK agreed to gave the order of cultural merit
bts: *has 3 comebacks including japanese one, launches superstar bts, goes on world tour, does interviews and speech at the un* army: *is well fed and worried about their health* namjoon: oh btw im dropping a mixtape in 3 days lmao
I just gave my mom a speech about how important BTS is to me and how much they mean to so many others and how they’re different from all the other groups in SK and how even though they’re famous they’re still in school and how they gave a speech at the UN and she’s impressed
Just two days till #mono and I’m not even over Kim Namjoons UN Speech! How will I survive the 23rd??? And at the same time I CANT WAIT!! How different will it be from his mixtape #BTS inspired by insta heikala pic.twitter.com/O3GuzUX3rX
bts officially owns october 2018, un speech, sold out stadium show, grammy interview, becoming homies with the pm, attending the conference in france, and to finish it off with rm2?!? wow we really snapped #mono
Honestly..she says they have some really nice, meaningful songs and still defends them at times when my dad comes at it with the „chinese guys trash“ again but..+she recognizes Joon and liked Stigma+Reflection but..she didn‘t even watch the UN speech although she like...
I painted parts of Joon's UN speech in the school bathroom stall for the volunteer project we were doing @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/Dc7F6Qkhf8
*RM's UN speech* 'I was a child who looked at the moon and dreamt.' MOONCHILD? #mono #MONOISCOMING #RM2ISCOMING @BTS_twt
So I checked out the #mono h/t and it looks like RM from BTS who gave that UN speech will be releasing an album next week. I wonder how different his sound will be from the group's sound. I'll be checking it out. Love how charismatic he was on Fallon and GMA.
Y'all process that this man produces all of bts' music, its on a world tour, promotes his music on both korea and america, prepares a fucking speech for the UN assemble and still manages to make a new mixtape, we truly don't deserve him
RM Idk y but I have this feeling that on ur speech back in the UN that time that ur talking about u of yesterday is thesame u of today and a lil bit witty of u in the future has connection with this MONO Playlist.
I think #MONO will be a hit among the public because Joonie gave the speech at the UN assembly so everyone will easily recognize him and check out his mixtape. I mean it will be impossible for the public not to recognize him... @BTS_twt
#RMono #RMonoMixtape I've been wondering a lot about it!!! Does it imply that our beloved RM is trying to make us understand that " No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, your gender identity" (RM at UN Speech, 2018) we are "mono"(one)!? @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/T3OTFN86jG
German tv (RTL) once again talked about @BTS_twt and for the first time (at least i've seen it for the first time) they showed a part of the speech at the UN and talked about love myself, even if it was short. They're making progress.
isn’t BTS the first ever band to give a un speech or am I missing something. like pls tell me i wanna know
Thyr hardwrking inspiring me to work harder. The fct that thy came from nthing & are on top of the world jst wow. Thy're music well I love it. I deeply connect to their songs and their messages. Like RM un speech hd me in tears cause self love is so undervalued and unappreciated.
“I wish I could love myself” -Reflection “I live so I love” -Trivia : Love “You’ve shown me I have reasons I should love myself” -Answer : LY “I’m learning to love myself, gradually, little by little” -UN speech I’M SO EXCITED FOR WHAT’S NEXT. #Mono #RM2IsComing @BTS_twt
He should include snippets of his UN speech in his playlist pic.twitter.com/8dsylYMdfU
mono better get so much love. stream it like crazy. let the whole world know that Kim Namjoon, the leader of BTS, the man who delivered his UN speech did THAT.
When did he find time to make his second mixtape during the UN speech and the Grammy interview and all the concerts we need answers #RMMONO @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/1KVKQ4525S
#mono if RM was THE awesome mixtape Wait for Mono That was produced by the guy who gave a speech to the UN and have the most touching words about any situation Really smart guy in the past Unbelievable BRAIN in the present @BTS_twt
all these concerts, interviews, UN speech, american and british shows; when did he have the luxury of time to make music ㅠㅠ im just sooo grateful I love him too much @BTS_twt
Namjoon did UN's speech, is leading BTS everyday as a role model, works hard with BTS's new album, did a documentary and even jet legged/tired/extremely worn out he still managed to do a mixtape.....I have no words I am so grateful to have him
"mono"? RM 2? coming on 23/10 ? WHAT IS EVEN WIG ? when did he got the time to finish this in such busy schedules? cb,tour,practice,tv shows,interviews,shooting,UN speech,paris fest!! OUR HARDWORKING MULTITASKER PRESIDENT INDEED #MONOISCOMING @BTS_twt
How did #RM have time to produce more music? He's the leader of he biggest boy band in the world, successfully performed in multiple concerts across NA and Europe, did a speech for the UN and numerous TV and radio interviews. You are crazy!!! #BTS #김남준 #NAMJOON #RM_MONOhttps://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1053662137346859008 …
SO Y'ALL TELLING ME NAMJOON THE LEADER OF BTS, A BUSY MAN WITH A PACKED UP SCHEDULE UNTIL 2020 HAVING A WORLD TOUR RN, THE ONE WHO HAD THE SPEECH IN UN IS DROPPING A MIXTAPE OUT OF NOWHERE WHAT THE FUCK I WAS IN PEACE pic.twitter.com/SU46s0KUrE
I was thinking of an @and then remembered the UN speech and yeah
So today my friend (a boy who is hate kpop) ask me if i like bts and i said yes and he ask me did them make a speech at UN and i said yes and he said "i really love his speech. His words was something. Even if you are not bts stan you will still amazed with his words" i cried. pic.twitter.com/OxW5IsE2uU
at this point, we're just competing against bts bts: just did a speech in the UN to promote self-love :D armys: just donated 17393928 to charity :D bts: just brought awareness to the public about different issues :D armys: just sent flowers to the ppl nice to our boys bts: wELL
You said we don't need to defend BTS?? If not because ARMY defend them from any stupid accusation that they had in the past, they will just disbanded and forgotten. There will be no UN speech, no Cover Time Magazine, #1 BB200, and so on and so on.
Watch "[ENG CC] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy” #Youth2030  #BTSxUnitedNations" on YouTube -https://youtu.be/dxWGbsqTxeo
True. This is the reason I avoided k-pop for the longest time because it seems like something you've to commit a lot and I was not ready. I was just going to listen to BTS casually(and was doing so) but after listening to Namjoon's un speech I fell down the rabbit hole
People from all ages, genders, ethnicities can resonate with their music and message! They truly helped, help and continue helping so many people around the world I love their work with UNICEF in order to #EndViolence and their speech at the UN for #GenerationUnlimited
And oh bdw another info- RM is actually Sagittarius Moon. That's why he a is different kind of virgo and also very deep thinker . Has knowledge of almost every country culture wherever they land for tour. Has big visions - UN speech etc
@BTS_twt showing up to the year end awards after a successful world tour, 2 billboard #1, speech at UN, meeting up with president & being on the time magazine cover https://twitter.com/RSpotlights/status/1050921142553178112/video/1 …
I went home and met my mom & dad after long eight months. I rarely talk about BTS to her and she didn’t know any kpop stars but when I said “I’m going to concert on november later”, her first response was “is it BTS? they’re the ones who gave speech at UN!”
They have inspired me to do stuff for the people around me. Me and my friends started a gay-straight-alliance for anyone lgbt in our small school and I was totally inspired by the un speech! Trivia love is our national anthem
Guys don’t hate me but I don’t think bangtan gonna win the song of the year .... when there is bts namjoon un speech :(
our president didnt give a speech at UN to be at #6
ok sure nag speech bts sa UN but lets not forget the first boyband member that did it pic.twitter.com/iOAs8QlDdw
this army mama started art 101 course with unbc! i got 2 journal entries n 3 chapters to catch up on n a presentation tomorow morning i chose bts & my subject 3 topics include: #endviolence uniceff, UN RM speech and Who is BTS n Army intro then on monday another presentation
I dont think so. In september, 15 his rank is on 4th place, way before UN speech. Anyway glad he got recognized he deserves step by step https://twitter.com/theseoulstory/status/1040753468246450176?s=19 …
There are so many beautiful bts memories I honestly can't choose a fave...maybe 1st bbmas or UN speech
Namjoon moved up a lot, I think he got a lot of clout after the UN speech. Also, does this combine stage names + real names for the results?
This brand reputation thingy is just a popularity contest right? B/c after the speech Namjoon gave at the UN, he should be #1 forever. #방탄진 #방탄소년단진 #방탄소년단 #진 #BTS⁠ ⁠ #JIN #防弾少年団 #ジン #金碩珍
Why is joon not #1 even after the UN speech? Smh. And hobi? My baby deserves top 10 :(
Definitely just cried at RM’s speech he gave at the United Nations and that’s not just because I drank gin and have gin tears. Fucking beautiful @bts_bighit @BTS_twt @UN #bts #RM #namjoonforpresident #namjoon
I've had 2 IRLs tell me (by their own accord) that they've watched a @BTS_twt video this week! One is a huge Superwoman fan so that's how she saw the UN speech, while the other follows Jimmy Fallon. The waves that were set in motion last week are finally hitting new shores
I explained to them what happened in the UN speech that BTS did, and elaborated on their #loveyourself message. And I explained how this message has improved my quality of life. How I'm happier and how I like putting myself first.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/k-75a0lh_kE?a [ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF- “Youth 2030- The UN Youth Strategy” REACTION

it is really boring but I got see bts there few times when fake love released , during billboard recently on UN speech too
YOU FCKERS PUT NAMJOONS UN SPEECH ON SOUNDCLOUD I FEEL ATTACKED I WAS LISTENING TO OSTUKARE, BLASTING IT AND THE NEXT I HEAR IS “My name is Kim Namjoon” NO THANK YOU I WASNT PREPARED IM EMO NOW @BTS_twt
don't they have a damn cb to worry bout? they need to worry about that shit flopping, not why BTS was at the UN giving a speech that save lives.
Your problem is that you don't know how to properly defend your faves. Some rude Army might have downgraded EXO's achievement in Dubai but that doesn't give you the right to also downgrade BTS especially saying something stupid as that when UN itself promoted RM's speech.
Feel like I’m watching another UN speech
People really out there degrading bts' speech at the UN and saying that it's more important to be played at a water fountain in another country, once—
am I the only one that listens to Namjoon’s UN speech like everyday? it’s just so inspiring and it makes me so proud @BTS_twt
if yall are fans yall wouldnt do this, BTS just gave a UN speech saying to love yourself, but yall are bringing other people down. what you do is so contradicting to what the people you idolise say haha get a rain check on yourself pls https://twitter.com/TheDeeKosh/status/1053200349677252608 …
@BTS_twt UN speech inspired me!
My parents used to think BTS was just a group of boys with looks, but ever since the UN speech, they support me for liking them. Today I opened to them how I first got into them not because of their looks, but because of the message of their songs. They looked so happy for me.
Ms. @krisaquino214 have you seen RM’s UN speech? @BTS_twt #BTS
my irls started to like bts nung mapanood nila yung un speech im crying
either they perform or not . BTS UN speech is still incomparable with that fountain. i cant believe one of ur folks discredited it
Honestly, I could say the same for you too. Don't go around trying to downgrade a UN SPEECH just because you're bitter and you hate BTS. Like sis come on pic.twitter.com/2CYo1DCjLZ
My English teacher played BTS's speech on UN on class. That made me so exciting. It was the best thing to see my most favorite IDOL on class. #RM #BTS #Taiwanpic.twitter.com/IwA8sQcj7R
30. when they were chosen to speak at the UN for the Youth 2030 programme. i have always been proud of BTS everyday esp. all their achievements from then up until now. but after namjon's speech, i felt that surging amount of pride for them & their voices have finally been heard.
antis are still making side comments about bts' speech at the UN as if their 2 brain cells had taken time to actually comprehend what the whole speech is all about lmao di kayo talaga love ng mama nyo
my Korean friend told me that his dad, who had the Beatles in his era, is extremely proud of bts and thinks BTS has surpassed the Beatles at this point. His dad even told him all about BTS’ UN speech and said it was very good :’)
https://twitter.com/time/status/1050359106970800128?s=21 … @BTS_twt gave a speech @UN , sold out @CitiField in 20 minutes and is on the cover of @TIME
they're really comparing bts' speech about ending violence and loving yourself at the UN to their song being played at a fountain https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
fair is not equality. it’s not fair when you know bts serving korean good names, charting 2x at hot 100, speech at un not deserves artist of the year. while the other group who has not reach the level and do nothing winning aoty. where your brain at?
He knew bout BTS' existent since I made him listen to Joon's UN speech. But he wasn't aware how deep I was (& still am) in this hole. So when he saw the stickers he went "Oh dear goodness, please." lol pic.twitter.com/Wj8RIZZuGc
the love yourself series is really THAT bitch. it got bts 2 #ones on billboard, a top 10 hit, attendance to multiple american award shows, performances at the amas, bbmas, agt + talk shows like fallon and ellen. it gave them a world tour, a pac, and the un speech. legendary.
My friend, who is in no way interested in bts came up to me today and she explained how she is FASCINATED by the fact that this once unknown group has suddenly rose to the top and is continuing to make progress after seeing their UN speech. This is what bts worked for.
@RichandKelsey love your reactions! Rich Have you heard bts's (Rm) UN speech. Please react to it would love to see that! Thank you
I wish they mention the un speech.
This bitch dare to about Tourist foundation over the UN and saying Joon’s speech is useless? Still petty af wow oh wow. No matter what antis trying to degrade BTS, they will keep on slaying nonstop whether these crazy ass antis like it or not.
Omg i laugh. It's ridiculous, comparing ur fav song play at fountain with BTS speech at UN. Omg can't stop laugh. https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
me promoting bts locals: bts produce and write their own music, which is filled with a positive message about loving yourself. they gave a speech at the UN an- bts: https://twitter.com/613_mp4/status/1052896571287789569/video/1 …
You already know BTS are gonna try and be humble at award shows. Acting as if they aren’t on the cover of TIMES, debuted at #10 on the hot100, 2x #1 album on the 200 chart, 1st korean act to perform at an American stadium (48K tickets sold in 20 min), AMA&BBMA winner,UN speech...
They Hating because their favorite never went to the UN, their favorite could never have a speech as good as RM speech and because BTS is doing better than their favorite
https://youtu.be/dxWGbsqTxeo This is their UN speech, give a view. I hate kpop in general: it's ugly, extremely manufactured industry where idols are selling their looks and fake cutesy images at first. But BTS are just THAT different
These guys saved a lot of lives, they are inspiration for a lot of people all around the world. Watch BTS UN speech, u will get it better
Hey so uhhhh I’ve been low key goin thru it since I got home from Citi Field. Namjoon’s ending speech there as well as his UN speech really moved me to want to Speak Myself. I want to share with you all where I’ve come from, how I found BTS, and what they mean to me.
I showed my mom namjoon's UN speech and she still says I shouldn't "exaggarate" with stanning bts pic.twitter.com/6GGC6g9h9h
T-T army and bts with you hun! I hope you find happiness soon! I just started my treatment for schizophrenia after Namjoon's UN speech, and i know that I'm not the only one suffering..every soul is, but let's learn to love ourslves and find happiness around
my mom srsly just told me that she showed her colleagues joon’s un speech and the idol mv when she told them i was going to see bts and they didn’t know who they are
30. when were you must proud of bts: UN speech
Diplomatic affairs between Korea and China in the wake of THAAD. Thats a big deal than a tumblr speech at the UN that didn’t solve anything. :) EXO literally makes the economy. Your faves eat because of EXO. You’re welcome.
my parents watched the speech bts gave at the UN and after that they watched a livestream of the concert last night uwu :(
like he brung up them selling out citifield in minutes and their lyrics and meaning and even the UN speech. like my dad knows who bts is because of how much i play them but hes never taken his own time to listen to them etc
And so a lot of haters been belittle your UN speech, and say no one even rmb what you say n it doesnt have political or any other impact to anyone. I dont agree, but i also half agree.. @BTS_twt
It was such a big thing that exo’s music was played at such important place of Dubai but say that bts’s speech at un was useless this is too much. Both group are doing amazing things!!!
Swear this is the time I realize this fandom barks worse than dogs and even 3year old is more wiser than this Did this b!tch said #BTS UN speech is useless nd that song played that tourist place is better, sorry even if it was played still BTS has the best streams on Anghami
Urgh im just gonna state this here, amazing that exo is able to have their song played at Taj Mahal. Its also amazing that bts is able to be invited to give a speech at the UN. Both events has their own significance. I apologise on behalf of whoever made that tweet degrading Taj-
the fact that antis have nothin else to drag bts on so resort to trying to degrade their un speech is just sad...
so i’ve had this Singaporean family friend who rolls her eyes whenever i mention bts but last week i made her watch namjoon’s UN speech and now she’s kinda WHIPPED HSKSJK WHAT HAVE I DONE
If you think un speech is useless, then the fountain is much more useless and i don't see exo being on the cover of time magazine anytime soon. No wonder I jumped ship from exo to stanning bts instead unmute your twt and face all of us & stand ur ground instead of being a coward
I just saw an egg saying BTS’ UN speech was “useless” and comparing it to their song playing in a fountain and I’m laughing so hard this is hilarious Imagine thinking speaking at the UN is the same as playing your song at a fountain I can’t pic.twitter.com/s56LWhpwDc
Y'all can't believe the amount of rts and likes this tweet is full of stupidity and nonsense. imagine comparing bts speech at UN that empowers and encouraging the youths to a song in a water sprinkles.
You insulted BTS about having a speech at the UN ad now you want respect? Girl you still call them begtan, you're still stuck at the time where they are rookies. Wake up sweetie!
This is the most funniest joke i've ever seen it's so hilarious. How can BTS's speech in UN was useless and means nothing? Oh c'mon dude, u gotta wake up now and face the fact that their speech is way moreeee important than ur existence. #LoveYourselfhttps://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
{13} BTS were on the cover of "Time-Magazine" and "Rolling Stone", held a speech in front of the UN general assembly and personally kept in contact with their fans, the "Army". +
And yall say u hate armys not bts. Imagine comparing at whole ass speech in UN who inspired many of us to a song playing in fountain oh. Im sorry exo has a fan like u https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
lmfao. Imagine thinking bts UN speech was useless?! Educated people can't relate!! And what lesson would I get in listening a song in a fountain?! I live here and no one's talking about that fountain so what's your point?! https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
lol the water sprinkles fans are still talking about bts giving the UN speech. Wow such committed fans pic.twitter.com/Q6ZaNJ9UJi
And people had the audacity to say he didn't write his UN speech. C'mom this man is a modern poet. He speaks through poetry. #BTS #MPN #BTSARMY @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/R9AhEqIyzh
This is a joke right? Hahaha! Sure UNICEF invited them to speak at UN but girl, Comparing BTS speech at UNITED NATIONS to a fountain you sure is sick. Yeah, fountain is an achievement to exo/exols but not everyone knows about it except your fandom and people who likes exo. https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
@lisaxakram have you seen this!! Eggsolss sprinkler vs BTS UN speech Eggs are kinda stoopid nowadays rite??
Its 1am & I’m listening to namjoon’s UN speech. It still makes me tear up. I just can’t believe this man walked into my life to inspire me, to make me want to be a better version of myself everyday. I’m forever thankful for him & BTS
The fact that being a youth in such a toxic society you still are like this is meaning you here for clout. Exos power played at the fountain was monumental for kpop but so was the UN speech by BTS. Youre just a salty ass. Best wishes tho
on his head. i told him about, time, UN speech, award from president as well as i explained the song whalien52 and idol to him. told him about bts being producer, composer etc. i wish he'll stop being judgemental. idc if he dont stan ,. but atleast respect bts
Do they really not think before even uttering such words oh well. How does a tourist view of them even compare to BTS at the UN assembly, as representatives of Today’s gen because of their countless philanthropic work and ofcrse Sir Namjoon’s speech. https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
meh, no one does but my mom only had a little interest in namjoon since he had a speech in the un and thought that it was educational and inspiring so she wasn't offensive
Why would you compare UN to a tourist place? And calling BTS speech useless? B**** please they talk about speaking yourself to others be confident about yourself and you downgrade their speech... i think you don't understand english at all.... https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
Before im a silent bts stan. I just stream them on youtube. One thing I've learned from BTS is dont let others dictate your life. Do what makes u happy. That UN speech is an eye opener. Now i dont care what others think. I will just enjoy them and their music
You literally comparing UN to the fountain show which was actually organized by Exo's fansites where as the officials from 198 countries were listening to BTS's speech on UN. Exo please release your album so these eggs could really get some another dumb thing to talk about. pic.twitter.com/EUeXuo7mX0
BTS UN speech was was speaking about youth,struggles,hardships, what it takes to faceyourself,loveyourself,knowyourself,speakyourself because this is struggle of society, & youth, obviously seem like u never hit a hardship before & didn't listen to what RM said apparently https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
congratulations you're gaining our attention. Why are u saying BTS speech is useless? They delivered a speech in front of highly respected people from around the world. It's THAT UN & UNICEF. I'm not force u to liking BTS but if u can't appreciate them, just ignore
They compared BTS appearance and Namjoon inspiring speech at UN with their favs useless and meaningless tower advertisement or whatever it call.? I'm giggling The really had a blind heart indeed.seriously
So RM’s UN speech was useless while that fountain was honorable??? LMAO! Just say you’re jealous that your oppars impact can’t reach #BTS level now. #MPN #BTSARMY @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/japVq7FR66
I can't believe and egg just completely called the bts' un speech "useless" just to say that their group did something in a fountain... of course because go to the UN is basically nothing compared to have your song played in a FOUNTAIN ... in dubai
biggest joke of the century. SHE IS THINKING THAT FOUNTAIN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN UN SPEECH WHAT DID I JUST SEE? A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF EMBARRASSMENT BABY DO WHAT YOU WANT AND ENJOY BTS' MUSIC FOR NEXT 7 YEARS WITH US AND GAIN SOME BRAIN CELLS. https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
I don’t think comparing BTS speech in UN to your fave song played in a fountain is the right decision tho. You know it’s gonna coming for you. Just think first before tweeting. You can drunk tweet and saying useless stuff idc but NOT this kind of stuff. Duh! https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
You're literally one hell of an Idiot for even having a mindset that *BTS's UN SPEECH*, which was 6 mins 41 secs btw, is useless And 2nd what tourist spot? what group? what are you talking about? Is It THAT irrevalent that Most of us don't even know what you're talking abt? +
imagine trying to downgrade bts' music by also saying that namjoon's speech at the UN was useless not to mention that bts do campaigns that helps the society and conveys life changing messages while theirs cant even produce a song pic.twitter.com/0fNUK7Z91G
This is a joke right? Hahaha! Sure UNICEF invited them to speak at UN but girl, Comparing BTS speech at UNITED NATIONS to a fountain you sure is sick. Yeah, fountain is an achievement to exo/exols but not everyone knows about it except your fandom and people who likes exo.
Hi sir! @BTS_twt have made great strides to help end violence against youth by partnering with UNICEF. Please feel free to check out their speech at the UN! https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
They reminded me that I should have the love for myself & I'm slowly trying to. Not really an open person to my family (regretted) but when joon's speech in UN "Speak yourself" made a great impact to me, and now I'm trying my best to share my views to 'em and to the people I know pic.twitter.com/idfgYB7I1C
Seriously? You got guts comparing a UN speech that even HUGE celebs were impacted and praised it. Imagine comparing a speech that inspired so many people around the world and headed the campaign to end violence which bts donated $1M+ dollars to a song played at a fountain
y’all one day it’s rlly gonna be like “I’m so excited bts got nominated for the nobel peace prize :(( it seems like they only just gave that UN speech the other day”
++ you are telling a person that delivered the most powerful and inspiring speech at the UN does not what is best for him? You are think this person that said Speak Yourself meaning don't allow others to speak for Yourself will have sign up a long term contract if they were++
And I’m supposed to write about the UN for a group project ISIT TIME TO WRITE BOUT BTS SPEECH??
This is my excerpt inspired by RM’s speech at the UN. It’s a bit late, but better late than never. My friend told me to write something so my thoughts went to RM and the topic of self love, and I wrote this. Enjoy! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/5s0bbUJKGU
so what about if they are the first kpop song ? so what about it? does it affect to to their country and got react with countless of people like Whoopi Goldberg . seriously BTS UN speech and that fountain is incomparable just sit down there and stream to ur favs music
im thinking about what jimin was saying on the topic of the UN speech in his live the other day that when teenagers or just people in general are struggling, words are what they need most. it's so true. what else is as comforting as the power of words. #7MoreYearsOfBTS @BTS_twt
I didn’t compare. I never said fountain was more important than UN. Learn to read. They have a lot of achievements and that speech ain’t one.
My best bts memory was their speech in the UN
Sis really thinks her faves performance is to Namjoons UN speech level? I HAVE to laughed, they don’t even deserve to mentioned in the same sentence. BTS outsold outperformed outsung outrapped outspeeched outcharted outproduced and outriched lmfao https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
OR ANOTHER UN SPEECH. ? pic.twitter.com/mXf6BXRNFX
I'd agree with this way more if you hadn't prefaced this by downgrading BTS' UN speech, since they are the first k-pop group to ever do that – just like EXO are the first k-pop group to have their song played at the fountain. They are both firsts. We needn't downgrade either one.
yall think a FOUNTAIN is comparable to the collaboration with unicef and a un speech that named bts “next generation leaders” sit the fuck down and buy your fave’s albums cause answer is gonna outchart for fave’s comeback.
You reduced a whole UN speech to nothing when pretty sure you didn't even watch the whole event, not just BTS's speech and what the event was to tweet such ignorant statement.
one year what others couldn’t do in 100, no one even knows what song or what “singer” that is But everyone knows BTS, their UN speech, their Time magazine cover and their influence so next time sit down and stfu before trying to be edgy by clowning serious matters
Imagine downplaying the importance of the UN speech just because you hate a group.. btch the UN never got this much attention to a campaign as much as it did with BTS.. didn’t start a change? Tell that to the thousands of kids and women that will benefit from the millions raised https://twitter.com/baekhyun_amara/status/1051845575476486144 …
bts really performed a soldout stadium in NY, were invited to the grammy museum, said a speech at the UN, became the cover of time magazine, were invited to a Korea-France meeting by the president, broke a record for the O2 arena the 1st time they went to London.. in like a month
I always tell my mom abt their accomplishments (unicef etc.) and i rlly apreciate her efforts to listen n show that shes genuinely interested in what i hv to say! She also clapped when i showed her rm's UN speech, saying that theyre so different fr other kpop groups
you know what they said? Namjoon’s speech at the UN was really good BUT they said that their songs (BTS) suck ???
Ah, you'd think that, after BTS met UN officials and Namjoon delivered an amazing speech, no one would go out of their way to criticize your musical taste while listening to "these Asian boys" and "you're black, what the fuck".
My sister is a hardcore army like me so we both get to scream about bts but my parents keep fluctuating. They're really impressed with bangtan's talents & especially their UN speech but sometimes they lowkey hate them bcs i spend my time & money on them jdksjdkskd
@spongemind referred to your UN speech in their language learning podcast!!! https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spongemind-podcast/id1054603657?mt=2 …
My parents support me,specially my mother.she knows how special,important they're in myself.and she's grateful. :) we now and them talk about them.last time we talked about the speech they did at the UN and she said so many beautiful positive things about our boys
I try but he really doesn't want to hear about it, not even when i told him about UN speech or the cover of time mag. He mocks me because i'm 44.
WKDKWKKS this is from a speech that namjoon from bts did for the UN

@FBE react to BTS UN speech you cowards
-they called bts a phenomen -mentioned time magazine -mentioned their un speech (included quotes) -talked about tickets in Berlin selling out in 9mins -quoted lyrics of love myself and praised it as poetic -said it's similar to 90s pop music -explained their UNICEF campaign

German TV RTL2 showed BTS! And they mentioned the UN speech! Thank you @rtl2 @BTS_twt #BTSinBerlin #BTSinBerlinD2
Well, my mom is 72, and each morning for years we have coffee together and chat. Lately I've been telling her about BTS (UN speech, world tour and stuff), so now when we sit for coffee she's like "What's the news about the boys?" And she watches the MVs when I stream, lol
@mstaronline and @sinarharianSH the BTS boys went to the UN to send their heartfelt speech but you not wrote an article about it. They stand at the same stage as Tun M!!! Our journalists is really a joke nowadays.
she always ask for jungoo and sometimes tae and she cried cause of namjoons speech during the UN.. HUHU
no one care even though if he have 1000 song credit. bts will fine without him he the least favorite members. — Go and think he's the least favorite when he was the one giving speech in UN and he's the one koreans use for teaching… https://curiouscat.me/PastelJoon/post/680198333?1539781355 …
my parents support with all my fangirl shenanigans and even moreso when my dad watched Namjoon’s speech during the UN conference. They even try to surprise me with merch even if it’s unofficial ♥︎
I agree with you. But sorry, that speech was far from touching. Cheap, just ring a bell. Some ghostwriter's work.
Yes, even if they made a speech at UN, they are still who they are, like wearing a mushroom cloud from nuclear explosion printed, patoriosm T-shirt.
such an unrelevant article when you can write about bts speech in the UN or bts interaction with SK president. its not that hard to do some research & not spread more hates yang memang dah ada dikalangan meleis :))))
So well I'm 23 and I don't live with my family but I still shared them with my mother and she's okay with everything that makes me happy. I think she respects (or loves) them more after the UN speech though, she said she got emotional watching it
My mother understood my love for #BTS after they were in UN. She read RM's speech and she told that they were a good influence. My father and my stepmother tell nothing because my stepsisters loves BTS too They support our love for them.
My sister asked where she went wrong in raising me when I showed her the idol MV and had a disgusted look on her face I showed my dad the UN speech and he was like “you should marry them.”
I showed mom UN speech and she said" they are so humble and kind and genuine and their songs are good their lyrics are good" i showed her the Army singing epiphany with jin in a concert she said"you are missing out on a lot of things poor u" she was against me buying albums but-
Well to be fair this was before un speech.
My mom's very supportive, she even made me print Namjoon's UN speech because she loved it
I don't get tired seeing k media talking about @BTS_twt . Knetz needs to know how great they are and all the amazing things they are accomplishing. The UN speech was so powerful and inspiring. T #BTS for #TheGroup #pcashttps://twitter.com/joonhomo/status/1052393447729061888 …

30. When were you most proud of BTS During their participation in the UN general assemby. I really cried with Namjoon's speech.
I have seen a speech of his. He says such good things. Very inspiring" I had to walk away coz I was feeling emotional My 57 years father lowkey defended #BTS after watching one song of theirs and the Namjoon UN speech. Imagine their power

my tutor mentioned bts & talked about their UN speech, i've never been so proud
My mum sent me BTS’s speech at the UN article and I was... shook
idk but he said that all the threats are really fucking up w his mental health but he said that he was wrong as well for making a joke about it in the first place. He saw the UN speech and he said bts was pretty chill idk tho lmao
My not so kpop irl friend tells me that she's happy seeing @BTS_twt using their fame and success in the right purposes like spreading positive messages. She says after that UN speech, she realizes that kpop is not just cutesy cutesy. IM PROUD #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS
BTS.. so far 4 Daesang, got 3 gold RIAA, got double platinum RIAJ, 2 gold RIAJ with korean album two #1 albums, Top10 on BB, performed BBMAs & Jimmy Fallon, Graham Norton etc, Grammy Museum, speech at the UN, . #BTS
During the whole time Epiphany kept on playing in my head and I kept on thinking of their speech at the UN yet my classmates took it as a joke or me overreacting. Well im not sorry because BTS message really means something to me and because of what I’ve been through.
So, like this, I, we all lost our names. We became like ghosts. But I had one sanctuary and that was music. -BTS' RM speech at the UN | UNICEF
it's rly nice when she talks to me about bts related news and such, she likes them and has heard a little of their music and she also watched the un speech and she GETS why i love them . she's the absolute coolest
Imagine how proud their parents and family rn bc BTS get awarded with Presidential Order of Cultural Merit's, it's probably so special and happens right after UN honorable speech. Like, we as fans are so proud, just imagine the pride that their loved ones feel

I literally talked about bts to him for like half an hour And showed him joon's un speech
In other news BTS are on the cover of TIME magazine , They did a speech at UN and are ambassadors of UNICEF , ARMYs are the most hated fandom ...I am missing a lot here but these are the main premises
Oh my god u missed so much. BTS has a speech at the UN, performed at the BBMAS, Was on America’s Got Talent, Jungkook had red hair! Tear and Answer came out!
Jimin was speaking about the UN speech on his live and he pointed out that what he thought the most during the event was that for a person in need what can really make a difference is just one word of comfort. And then he said this... He is just so sweet and caring @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nBF8jP7gYa
ok so my brother told my mom about my psychiatrist treatment and now she's sending me bts related stuff and she told me she cried with Namjoon's speech at UN jsksjsk

And never forget the real picture: Kawards are good,we want them for BTS,but they can't change the fact that BTS are IT! These awards don't bring you sold out Citifield, UN speech,global recognition, meet with SK President & so on. We want them for BTS, but they don't need them.
So many thing happen during this @BTS_twt concert tour. To me the most beautiful moment are UN speech, Grammy museum interview, Jimmy/GMA/AGT shows, citifield concert, announcemenf of Order Merit, Time mag cover, Korea-France festival performer, met President and first lady.
lmaoo that why you’re artists aren’t giving a speech at the UN stop being salty, bts deserve everything also gl to your acc
BTS did so many great things this year, we didnt even imagine would happen in 2018. grammy museum, UN speech, US stadium, picture with President of SK, gold songs, #1 albums etc so many things which are unbelievable. the fact that 2018 has two more months + 2019 is starting ohgod
During the UN speech, Namjoon said he wanted us to “Speak Yourself”. Could this be the next era for @BTS_twt ? They’ve taught us to love ourselves. Perhaps now it’s time to learn to speak up and show ourselves. #BTS
I had to distract myself from the tattoos so during the ARMY one I watched BTS videos and while I got the BTS one, I watched the UN Speech. But they were worth it. I have CypherSix on my thumb but it's a combination of two fandoms so it sort of counts. pic.twitter.com/HasxjxKPWt

My mom saw the Beatles perform at Dodger stadium and always says she’ll never forget when she first saw them on Ed Sullivan. I felt the same way seeing @BTS_twt at Staples Center and on TV giving their UN speech. We’re witnessing history!
A little on the long side, but my reaction to BTS RMs speech at the UN is now up! Sensitive Content Warning http://youtu.be/e2d3iZDVcp8?a
If you could recommend a BTS video that's not a MV or song lyrics to someone that's not a fan to change their view of BTS what would you recommend? (Example: I'd show the UN speech or the Grammy Museum interview) #PCAs #IDOL #TheMusicVideo #BTS @BTS_twt
my friend (who, might i add, literally hated bts before) just told me that she thinks some of their music is good. and that she respects them now, because of their un speech. an army in the making, maybe? tho she still calls them girls...
I had to do a presentation today and i was so nervous and i dont know why but i thought about Namjoon and his UN speech and how even though he was so nervous he still did excellent & I swear it gave me the confidence and the courage, thank you @BTS_twt for always inspiring me pic.twitter.com/kGAIcIRUKk

One of her students is an English teacher in Korea and their school director is asking elementary to middle school students to MEMORIZE and LEARN BTS' UN SPEECH FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENTATION. They have to learn how to say the words correctly and explain the message clearly.
My siblings and cousin insult them. I used to get annoyed first but now I just throw facts in their faces. “ @BTS_twt gave an inspirational speech at UN. They won 74+ awards this year” it really shuts them up. Try it

So 5 minutes presentation with word 'Loyalty' which lead to being loyal to yourself and end with love yourself. Well i picked some words from namjoon's speech at UN for the presentation @BTS_twt
Next year I will visit South Korea because of @BTS_twt. I want to go to the flower festival that NamJoon talked about in his speech at the UN
Right!The most prestigious US and UK programs called them THE MOST BIGGEST BOY BAND ON THE PLANET. The innumerable critiques of important magazines, TIME calling them NEXT GENERATION LEADERS, the inspiring speech in UN. Definitely our BTS deserve the world, they're incredible

15 yrs from now, jungkook & seokjin are going to sit their kids down and say “here’s the watch the president gave us after our speech at the UN, and here’s where he signed it after the korea-france friendship concert in 2018” #PCAs #THEGROUP @BTS_twt #BTS https://twitter.com/__moss/status/1051615107459870720/video/1 …
never wouldve guessed that my dad just asked me abt bts being a unicef ambassador and joons speech in front of world leaders and delegates in un headquarters. i always knew he was a man of culture as well
bts’ voices are so calming that they could calm me when i’m in a middle of a breakdown. & to think before i didn’t know abt them i was so lost and having breakdowns almost everyday. that un speech namjoon did just made me remember why i respect them so much.
these people will do anything for clout, fyi im an army too and i hate it when bts gets dragged in the mud bc of nonsense. AND AFTER THE UN SPEECH??? like it was meant to bring the community together not go for each other's throats smh
Think about it Army gets selcas, tweets gcf run BTS bangtan bombs dance practices covers dvds tours vlives songs burn the stage bon voyage a movie a UN speech summer package memories dvds muster dvds BT21 fandom awards.... fuck I’d hate us too
What's a good senior quote guys even tho I'm a junior :0 I kinda wanna quote a bts song or Namjoon's UN speech idek
thank you BTS for taking the initiative to share important messages through your music, your UN speech, being titled as the next generation leaders globally by TIME magazine, and for representing your country greatly, we are all so proud of you @BTS_twt #BTSKOREASPRIDEpic.twitter.com/CZQqtmaxSM
S/he has an eating disorder, what's it got to do with the behavior of that person considering a FALSE & UNPLEASANT JOKE about "Killing Yourself" instead of #SpeakYourself got to do with reporting both!? So you'd tolerate such AWFUL THOUGHTS to something related to BTS' UN Speech?
@BTS_twt as ARMY, i'm beyond proud of what you've achieved in just 5 years! Speech at UN and even now performing in front of the president and sharing Korean culture globally. I hope you all realised what you are doing is right and keep pressing on. I love you all!!
One for everyone after UN speech last September.
Ok so imma need y’all to tell me why this SoundCloud rapper chick is spreading false information about BTS at the UN speech she really out her saying they telling everyone to kill them selves she better stop pic.twitter.com/IEoBlGzlWi
NAMJOON'S SPEECH DESERVES AN AWARD OR EVEN THE UN HAVE TO PUT THOSE WORDS IN A BIG WALL PROUD IS UNDERSTATEMENT
Aww so cute I acc told my mom about BTS’ achievements too after the UN speech cuz she saw me watching the live stream late at night. She watched the speech on yt several times and was so impressed with their message! She’s glad bts is inspiring so many people around the world

@BTS_twt Grammy Museum, UN Speech, TIME, and with SK's President. Name a better korean group. I'm waiting. #BTSKOREASPRIDEpic.twitter.com/zaqWoCpnd9
This year @BTS_twt won 4 Daesang, 75 awards, got 3 gold RIAA, got double platinum RIAJ,2 gold RIAJ with korean album,gained 3.3B views 4.5M sales on Gaon & two #1 albums, Top10 on BB, performed at BBMAs & biggest us TV shows, Grammy Museum, gave a speech at the UN, LEGENDS ONLY
Yesterday I met a girl in Colombia, she is a student, we talked about music & I asked her if she's heard about @BTS_twt,she's seen their memes but never listened to them so I told her a lot about them & sent her the UN speech...today she told me she cried after watching it
seems like BTS US (BBMA) - BTS UN speech and France perf - BTS US tour - BTS London - BTS Amsterdam - BTS Germany - BTS France then going back home to KOREA
I told my dad about BTS, their UN speech, their invitation to the friendship concert, and the fact that they were invited by the president of Uganda and such, and he warned me about politicians using them because of their influence. He said the UN speech was a BIG deal to others.
They've came from humble beginnings. They have raised over 1M dollars for their UNICEF campaign #ENDVIOLENCE, to help young adults and children around the world. Here is their UN speech for their UNICEF's new campaign @_GenUnlimited.https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
@BTS_twt Power be like: @GRAMMYMuseum interview @UN @UNICEF speech, meeting @moonriver365 @TIME cover, sold out @CitiField stadium concert in mins. Even their walks are powerful. This will be them at every year-end award show this year. Yes,Jungkook,y'all #BTSKOREASPRIDE pic.twitter.com/unAzbfjnH8
Anyways GUYS, for the first time in Israel, they've talked about @BTS_twt on TV, and even mentioned the UN speech and a little of their whole message, it wasn't much but it's a start!
Omg !! Our teacher told us to present the biography of a famous person and i chose BTS , i talked about some of their achievements like their speech at the UN and now whenever we talk about korea or asia everyone instantly looks at me !! https://twitter.com/jknsrn7/status/1051493376758087680 …
i know right, kpop stans and khh stans found it hilarious, it's not even feeding the "we hate the famous band bts so we are unique" agenda, it's just ugly how she is defaming them by editing their UN speech + basically telling us to go k*ll ourselves
@BTS_twt appeared in some of the most popular shows in the world topped the Billboard album chart twice Grammy museum GenU Ambassadors + UN speech doing their 1st US Stadium Condert TIME MAGAZINE COVER performing in front of South Korea's President & First lady #BTSKOREASPRIDE
Right?! I thot they’d do more same only more fans, higher in the charts. But we’ve got COVER OF TIME, UN SPEECH, PERFORMING AT A NATIONAL EVENT W/ THE PRESIDENT, BEGINNINGS OF STADIUM TOURS, PRESTIGIOUS FOREIGN ARTICLES & TALK SHOWS. All w/ humility. #BTSKOREASPRIDE @BTS_twt
In the span of two months BTS: gave speech at the UN, did a US stadium concert, grace the cover of TIME, performed in a diplomatic event in front of sk's president+first lady. If all of this aren't gonna stop you from giving attention to irrelevant kpoppies then idk what will
Other fandoms can get their faves on the chart (provided thry try that rather than concentrating on us) & try to get them all the awards but nothing can top this. Speech at UN? President's attendance specially for them? No. These moments of pride are for #BTS alone. #PCAs #IDOL
So many great things happened to bts this 2 months : -their speech at the UN -Love yourself concert in Citi field -TIME magazine -Performing at the korea-france friendship concert @BTS_twt , im proud of you pic.twitter.com/zS6E2DNHok
so many great things happened in 2018. grammy museum, first US stadium, two #1 albums, #10 track, UN speech etc and now president inviting and meeting BTS in a foreign country and only attending because of them. & there's two more months left #BTSKOREASPRIDE
BTS went from being cut out of music shows to giving a speech at the UN and performing in front of the president of SK this is the character development they deserve
I’m looking forward to the BTS intro video that will highlight the BBMAs, UN speech, CITIFIED, TIME Cover, TV Show appearances, SK President meet up, etc. It will definitely be EPIC
Today I saw one of my coworkers after 1 month (she is not at work because of some health issues). We were talking about London... And than she said: "I saw them at the UN" And I were really surprised.."You saw their speech?!" And she said: "Yes and it was really good"+ @BTS_twt
The interesting thing is: both the UN speech and today's event were announced only days prior. 2 and a half more months of 2018, god knows what else they might have on the way that we could never be able to even guess. Anything can happen. @BTS_twt #BTSKOREASPRIDE
BTS really gave a beautiful speech at the UN. BTS are really out here hugging the president and First Lady of South Korea. The president of SK is really adjusting his schedule to Bangtan’s. Proud is an understatement, I would have never imagined this. They deserve it.
Its does , cuz first of all that speech was held in UN , and the discussion was to encourge people to help the youth and to end violence affecting them , when you replace it with a term which that person posted , which claims that BTS encourages suicide , that's defamation and
But..it has been released..you can find it on YouTube .. if you can't find it. I will send a video of the UN speech k
I celebrate this in terms of influential power... Not opinions like... A whole UN speech exist and BTS dissed the system before
Bts gave a speech on speaking and accepting oneself at the UN, are on the cover of time as next generation's leades, met the president and first lady, got customized watches from the president, got invited by the president of Uganda, received order of merits, sold out citifield-
I hope Antis will make more Petitions ... In less then a month , we got UN Speech , TIME "Next Generation Leaders" , #Friendshipconcert , Hug from THE PRESIDENT & 1st Lady !! KARMA has been holding on !! Now it's biting everyone in the a$$#TheGroup #BTS #PCAs @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/fPn4uKipVc
When they say bts schedule is full and packed in 2018 it LITERALLY is, i mean look at them been flied over US and now europe and still coming. And when they said 2018 is BTS year, it LITERALLY is, been given speech in UN, to be in the cover of Times Magazine, first Citi Field
bts gave a speech at the UN, performed in front of the Presidents of France and Korea and other prominent figures, were named as the next generation leaders by Time all in the span of just two months. I'm bursting with pride. #BTSXPresidentpic.twitter.com/Qu7Rc4ZNiQ
Citifield The UN speech Time magazine #BTSXPresident A lot happened lately and i’m so proud BTS are on a whole other level pic.twitter.com/foFVHwBeVe
the past two months have been crazy for bts.. they started their tour, went to several famous talk shows + AGT, gave a speech for UN, performed in a sold out stadium... and now they are besties with the president
Notice how eggs stopped or dwindled down in using the igloo being liked by the president bec he gave away albums ever since the UN speech. Now they really cant say anything because it's BTS who got them hugs

UN speech. I voted for #BTS for #TheSocialCelebrity of 2018 Cast your vote for the E! People's Choice Awards at #pcas

I just watch BTS speech in UN, got me thinking "is this important?" yea you can blabber about having voice of your own but why that I cringed? I mean, Malala's speech is better. She got the meat and it was well delivered. I understand her message. #mytwocents
so im a writer for my school's newspaper and im covering the UN meeting BTS attended and y'all,, reading that speech just made my eyes water,, like i heard it before but now i'm just like damn,, they really did that
2. Namjoon said that they're the first Korean musicians to hold a stadium tour. Korean. Musiciand. They can say kpop all they want but that doesnt change the fact that the kpop label is holding them down. E.g BTS makes a speech at UN. The headlines? First KPOP group
That part when you talked about RM, about his thoughts regarding the Love Yourself series, campaign, and the speech at the UN. #BTS #TheSong #PCAs @BTS_twt
My male classmates suddenly became interested in BTS since they made a speech at UN, they kept asking me, they're totally our next generation leader
the rough translation describes the boys (7 members, global phenomenon, sold out concerts in Paris, it explains the purpose of bts and quotes joon’s UN speech) and it says they’ll perform DNA and IDOL (two of their most important title tracks)
it says that bts has sold out their concerts in Paris and it kinda summarizes namjoon’s speech at the UN and that they’re going to perform DNA and Idol
big up graham northam for asking good questions about their unicef campaign, namjoons speech at the UN, their message as a group. sad to see different interviewers making it not about bts at all and asking dumb questions...
Get urself to do a speech at the un before talking shit to bts
Me and my mum watched graham norton yesterday morning and she was so like shocked about the time cover and the un speech and asked me about their campaign and stuff and also sad they were like incredibly pretty. BUT MY POINT IS that it's important that bts aren't boiled down to
Ever since @BTS_twt's Namjoon did his "Speak Yourself" speech at the UN, I wanted to create a series of subtitles of the picture speaking. I can't wait to see how far this series will go! pic.twitter.com/Hh8WXmJhZ0
BTS: -delivered a speech in UN -next generation leaders -one of the biggest boy group ALSO BTS: -doesnt know how to crop pictures -accidentally leaves his shopping bag on a lego store -never completes a trip without losing something
@BTS_twt so today's a big day. You guys are performing at the korea France friendship concert in front of dignitaries. That's a huge achievement. Same as UN speech. Do your best Bangtan Kings. Looking forward #BTS #BTSinParis #BTSLYTour
2018 rlly blessed us and BTS. Like we're really well fed. From million sellers, 5 Guinness records, TIME magazine, UN speech, awards and a happier bangtan.
Yes! Like I've sent the ones for Kendis Gibson's idiotic & unethical journalism during BTS' UN Speech. I'm not going to silent my twitter rant over these three idiots who thinks they are ABOVE THE LAW! I'm so furious right now but I'm trying still to be chill. We should all do it
Now, this is what @BTS_twt is talking about... in their UN speech, albums, songs etc... everyone has their own struggles in life but never be afraid to share it and inspire others #SpeakYourself
Our boys hve made it to the top w/ all their shit talking! Cover of TIME magazine and UN speech proves it. Their negativity doesn’t phase me bcus obviously those that matter know how GREAT #BTS is n that is why they are the most talked abt 7 influential amazing boys in the WORLD.
my mum didn’t approve of me stanning @BTS_twt because she thought they were fuckboys. I showed her namjoon’s UN speech and now her opinion has changed.
i told my mom about bts and the meaning of their Love Youself albums. uwu she said her favorite members are jimin, jungkook, and jin. i also told her about yoongi's mixtape and their UN speech
BTS appeared on indonesian local tv about the UN speech this morning. And my dad said this is the only handsome one while pointing at Jin. And he was amazed that BTS gave speech in UN. Yes dad. Finally you admit it. This was the first time he said something good about bts ㅠㅠ
BTS was featured on Indonesian local tv. they talking about BTS' in TIME cover magazine, BTS won AMAs 2018, BTS in the UN giving speech for youth. im so proud! pic.twitter.com/K26gzeNcPV
Dont be baffled with the hysteria, i have hopes for the youth who stan BTS. Armys do initiative to support charity. But first of all BTS taught us to love ourselves too.this is their leader’s empowering speech in UN https://twitter.com/mariade2xro/status/1050901129033334787?s=21 …
He played ‘Bubbly’ and sang a few words. Oh, he finally noticed the hotel menu/brochure on his headboard and took it down . I think he also talked about Namjoon’s speech at the UN? Lastly he said in ENG: Good morning, Good afternoon and Good evening. #HappyJIMINDay @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/UjAkhckNbp
U DELETED IT JUST TO ADD THE EMOJIS IM CRYING THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO DELIVERED A SPEECH AT THE UN I LOVE YOU
See amas for example they are winners but still didn't go to perform and get the award due to their schedule also bts had the UN speech they of that gucci show how do you expect them to go??? Sk acknowledge bts as handsome especially V but now they can't do any solo yet

i’m fucking angry and sad my whole family keeps saying the n word my mum STILL thinks i only ‘fantasise’ being with bts because of their looks and it’s only small girls screaming about them i fucking showed them the un speech and then i get this back? honestly fuck off
oh my goddd y’all don’t know SHIT. the un consists of 193 countries and the only people who really care abt bts’ speech are fans this doesn’t mean impact for ALL nations when there are still countries who aren’t included, AND that 193 probably haven’t heard about it yet.
this is what ppl who dismiss BTS and RM's words during that UN speech just bc they're a popular korean group fail to understand. pic.twitter.com/OERAFI6pN0
i was watching graham norton with my mum and for once she didn't make any condescending comments about bts, i think she's starting to realise why they mean so much to me bc she looked so interested when joon was talking about his un speech
They... BTS literally championed people of all skin colors and gender identities in their UN speech and encouraged them to speak themselves.... which is more than almost any idol has done for pro-lgbtqia activism. I’m really https://twitter.com/daeguscene/status/1050914414105387008 …
i told my husband bout the hate @BTS_twt gets and how antis even signed up petition for their hatred. his only answer.. 'how can they have soo much time to do such thing with hatred? what's with their jealousy? (oh..he was soo amazed with NJ UN speech) #ILoveMyHusbandhttps://twitter.com/Metro_Ents/status/1050657433259892736 …
Ok.. My mom always tells me why BTS?? SO i opened their speech in the UN and guess what.. She smiled like sooo wide.And told me that she is proud that i listen to BTS.. She told me love yourself dun give up.. So BTS thank u so much she was impressed #BTS #PCAs @BTS_twt
I'm not talking about selena. I'm talking about the song. And define "way more". BTS literally gave a whole speech at the UN
K media said Hollywood star Whoopi Goldberg was so touched by @BTS_twt story of RM’s UN speech at Graham Norton show and gave them her shirt saying “thank you for all of the joy you're bringing”. Jungkook was wearing that shirt on their group photo later. https://m.insight.co.kr/news/183959

Anyone hating on #BTS should listen to their UN speech & learn to love themselves. When you start to love yourself, maybe you'll realise that you don't need to hate on people & things you're not familiar with & learn to appreciate them instead. Sashay the hate away. #GrahamNorton
My mom just saw @BTS_twt’s speech at the UN and said that she thought they are some sort of politicians in South Korea, too. She also read some article about them. She said that it seems BTS will surpass The Beatles popularity, etc. UWU my army ego

yeah that must really suck. My mom thinks BTS are good, what do you say, idols? She really likes the message they send and the speech Namjoon had at the UN. My siblings aged 4 and 5, LOVE BTS and listen to them alllll the time. So my stepfather watch BTS with my siblings

The Swedish news outlet ‘Svenska Dagbladet’ @SvD put out a video about @BTS_twt on their IG https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo1KIt3lhyW/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=128p3nt9ydafo … They wrote about BTS’s success, tour and the UN speech (full trans. in reply) Thank you @goldensope01 for letting us know #PCAs #BTS #TheGrouppic.twitter.com/9JcAc5UMA6
@BTS_twt’s message and passion for their music has inspired and uplifted millions of us ARMY. This is the speech that the group’s leader, Namjoon, gave at the UN. Hope you enjoy! https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156?s=21 …
it’s so cute when bts achieve something big like the speech they had for UN, selling out stadium tickets, etc and my irls tell me about it as if i don’t know about it and jst congratulate me as if they were my achievements
me: BTS are great artists. They inspired people through their music. They are all so talented, like very talented. Not to mention, they attended the UN, and Namjoon made a speech. Idk what to say anymore, I'm so proud, they saved millions of lives bts: https://twitter.com/kthgy/status/1040211994782130176/video/1 …
i just remembered ,, my boy classmate suddenly asked me what was the name of that bts member who delivered the speech @UN then i told him it was RM and he told me it was really amazing he was actually in awe while watching it
BTS is the only escape I have and honestly Idk what my parents think hhhhh at least they’ve seen them on tv that namjoon has given a speech in the UN which means they know they r a good influence
I like to think of Jin as an icebreaker for the guys. The Time magazine and UN speech mentions helped balances the interview and gave people something to think about. Sadly,there were the expected xenophobic comments, but more than outweighed by positive ones
Even if its not the music that is able to reach to the GP...but the powerfull speech in UN did, its already good enough..in a way to educate them saying..'we are not stanning a mere beauty face' we are stanning talent and a spokesperson for youth.. #R1BTS @BBCR1 @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/EzatyHassan/status/1051026657576775680 …
#BTSxGrahamNorton Thank You @BBCOne @TheGNShow and @grahnort For having @BTS_twt I already like your show very much and having our boys on your show was something we really wanted. Thank you for mentioning their Times magazine cover and UN speech.

+ guess what? i just got to know, that after BTS' speech at UN. it wasn't my sister who showed my mom, instead it was my dad who did. he showed my mom the video of RM's speech, also made her read the entire speech. and they were being proud that we stan such men. im gonna cry.
I'm very proud too. And Graham Norton was great! Love how he made the kids at ease and how he proudly shown the Time cover and UN speech.

My grandmother messaged me and said that she saw bts on the news and their UN speech and she said that I made a good choice of being their fan. She said Namjoon spoke really well
Thank you for this Sir. I am a 40yo mother. Since i found @BTS_twt a year ago, i feel some new hope for my children future. Bcs BTS musics and lyrics really represent what the real youth is. Never knew before that they would give a heart moving speech at the UN. Really proud
I just didn't catch why she was giving them her shirt, when I was watching the Grahan Norton clip. Yes, I was so proud of their UN Speech when it happened, I wish other people would take his words to heart
I can’t help but cry at how far @BTS_twt Have come they proved everyone that didn’t believe wrong they went from being rookies to winning their first award, being on top 200 to giving a speech at UN to being named “Next Generation Leaders”they deserve it I’m proud of you boys pic.twitter.com/O7r6vexeCW
ok but after joons un speech???? how??? do you still have face???? to say BTS ARENT PRO LGBT ACTIVISM I????? wow there really ARE dumb ppl on this bird app huh https://twitter.com/hopeworldians/status/1050921207137230849 …
I see many army post bts' UN speech to locals! You did great army! Keep going! #BTSxGrahamNorton
1. Do not involve soyeon in your petty fanwars cause she's actually talented and doesn't deserve someone like you stanning her 2. Bts made pro LGBT statements both while giving interviews to major global publications AND at their speech in the UN in front of the first lady while
So all those songs that BTS has done that are gender neutral......Joons' speech at the UN......
I can't believe it either! Also the ARMY has been very kind to me and showed me more aspects of these guys and I'm shocked! They gave a speech in UN! I don't think any other Boyband has done it before #GrahamNortonShowhttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156?s=19 …
@TheGNShow thank you so much for having @BTS_twt on your show! I truly appreciated hearing more about their philanthropy and speech at the @UN!! Their positivity and talent truly knows no bounds! Great interview & performance #GrahamNortonShow
So nice to hear Graham ask about the UN speech!
The girl shouting « preach ! » at the end of joon’s explanation of his UN speech is a whole mood tbh #RM @BTS_twt #BTS #BTSxGrahamNortonpic.twitter.com/hH0pQUEYv2
They’re so much more than a boy band! Please look into their speech at the UN General Assembly as well as their work with UNICEF and the #EndViolence campaign as well as #GenerationUnlimited
His name's Kim Namjoon. His stage name's RM. Yes, he's so handsome but there's more. He's the leader of BTS and he has amazing rapping and singing skills. I recommend you check out his speech at the UN to learn a bit more about the kind of person he is.
Lol. I'm sorry for this. But army is passionate to pass on bts' message n music. anyway just wanna drop my personal fav song from their latest album. This song is also referenced for their un speech https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SYttJm0SE …
here’s a short clip of my oratorical speech yesterday. i got so inspired with namjoon’s speech at the UN that’s why i was able to do it. thank you @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/sqfB5WtlfT
I'm from south America, the people here are racist too, especially with Asian people, but after Un speech intelligent people look bts more serious.
Plz watch their speech at the UN! As they partner with UNICEFF To end child violence around the world! Their message of self acceptance was really powerful! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
They recently went to UN assembly generation unlimited where they give their speech related to self love....if you want to check them out i would recommend you songs like Tomorrow Dope Fire Paradise They have alot of genre depends which one is ur choice.. Do check them out
I was watching #bts #GrahamNorton and I thought I would check what they said at the UN. Wow very inspiring speech. pic.twitter.com/dep8wcFazt
After RM explained about the UN speech, I just tapped her on the shoulder and I was like "now you know why I listen to them and love them so much" and she was smiling and her face was like "we'll now I do" My mama everyone, let's cheer for her #GrahamNorton #BTS
i can tell you that when bts did the UN speech i posted it on facebook and send it to my dad sjebdkd'slls'dks
Thanks for being so open minded! I highly suggest checking out this thread https://twitter.com/aldornu/status/1029082502336585728?s=21 … and watching their UN speech as UNICEF ambassodors! Here’s a clip of another one of their live performances where all the members are physically able to dance pic.twitter.com/wX8SRxEPQK
tell every pressed white to stream idol and check out bts, the nation's biggest and best boyband! also, link them to the un speech bc they need to hear from our president, kim namjoon! #GrahamNorton
For the 1st time they're also seated w/ other artists during interview n here we could see how they're surprised to see what kind of musicians and artists @BTS_twt are for their message n impact to so many ppl, espclly the youth. Look at when GN showed the time cover n UN speech. https://twitter.com/GoAwayWithJae/status/1050808596068519936 …
apparently my sister’s school has been playing bts’ speech at the un on the moniters on loop for the past two days hhhhhh
@TheGNShow thank you Graham for mentioning the UN speech #BTS had given. Namjoon looked so happy and the passion in his voice was felt. The boys all looked so comfortable and seemed to have enjoyed themselves. #BTSxGrahamNorton #TheGNShow #BTSonGrahamNorton
BTS’ performance was amazing and they were so sweet in the interview, Joon talking about the UN speech got me teary I love them so much! #BTS #TheGNShow
This school year won’t end if I don’t do presentation about namjoons speech at the UN @BTS_twt
Actually, if you took two seconds of time to research (I know, being ignorant and racist must be terribly consuming) BTS produce and write their own music while doing intense choreography and have fans from all age groups. They just gave a speech at the UN a few weeks back
Well, yes they are. Sold out two shows in London at the O2 and it’s their first time ever performing in the UK and sold 4 million albums alone this year, broke Taylor Swift’s record for the most viewed music video in 24 hours, made a speech at the UN about, have been asked to -
They're @BTS_twt, seven talented Korean artists and UNICEF Ambassadors. Their leader RM, gave a speech at the UN for @_GenUnlimited.https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
So... Do I do a BTS song in my assignment? The UN speech? The whole love yourself album? Burn the stage? I DON'T KNOW
Here it is It was from @bts_bighit after their speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/yQg8yEOkZt

If their appearance and speech at the UN was historic, why’d they mistake NCT as BTS??? I’m—
here is mr kim namjoon/RM!!! he’s the leader of the group, fluent in english, king of rap! he’s 24(?) and he recently made a speech at the UN! he also has a mixtape called RM which i highly recommend as it’s actually art!! open up your dms if you wanna learn about bts tho uwu pic.twitter.com/DolCxgFadh

@BTS_twt at the Graham Norton Show I love that he brought up the times cover and the UN speech. gp viewers will be impressed, won't they? Overall very nice https://youtu.be/wBEu2Tmy_L4
#BTS #BTSArmy So, at school I decided to write an essay based on BTS and Joon’s speech at the UN. I had the choice to watch a movie and then write a review, but this is more important to me personally. The way that my teacher responded to them made me so happy UWU: pic.twitter.com/Phj7qqkD2L
This was a beautiful moment when Whoopi Goldberg a legend, honoured our Next Generation Leaders with her shirt, saying she’s giving them her shirt as a “thank you for all the joy they bring” after Namjoon spoke about the meaning behind his UN Speech. I’m so proud of @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/fpV1qUTWYE
The way @WhoopiGoldberg stood up to give them her shirt after Namjoon talked about his speech at the UN @TheGNShow @BTS_twt ( #TheGroup #BTS #PCAs @BBCR1 #R1BTS) https://youtu.be/wBEu2Tmy_L4
but thank you so much sir graham for asking about jimin and also jungkook, talking about the love yourself: answer album and giving shoutout to bts for their un speech pic.twitter.com/EB5FmSlazy
Proud to see an inspiring and influential group of musicians like @BTS_twt grace the cover of @TIME magazine. Their speech at the UN assembly, charity work for UNICEF, and incredible music has motivated millions of people worldwide to have hope for a better future
God created BTS to spread positivity & joy UN: Trump will have a speech God: send BTS Time: Trump cover but no pic God: BTS cover with picture https://twitter.com/agirlinthepark/status/1050810961148473344 …
Just watched the clip on YT from @TheGNShow Thank you @grahnort for talking about the message behind @BTS_twt music, their Time magazine cover & the speech at UN. The boys seemed happy & relaxed. #BTSxGrahamNorton
Our boys are so happy and proud about the TIME magazine and UN speech #BTSatGrahamNorton #BTS pic.twitter.com/urDk6Uei2E
Namjoon spoke about his UN speech and the message they want to convey. Then, Whoopi Goldberg said she’d give them her shirt to thank them for the joy they’re bringing. She stood up to unbutton her shirt and the boys stood up as if they were to receive an award :(( @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/cVBekDP9DR
I just watched a clip of BTS on Graham Norton and them being on the cover of Time magazine was mentioned and they were so happy and Namjoon spoke about his UN speech also Whoopi Goldberg giving her shirt, you can tell it meant alot to BTS, I can't wait to watch it tonight!
Lmao said someone who mutuals with jimtobergcf aka the person who shaded Joons UN speech, and talked shit/insulting about Hobi, Jin and Tae skills n wish our jmn to leave bts okay I'm wasting my time i guess
Lmao i just realized this user mutuals with jimtobergcf aka the person who shaded Joons UN speech, and talked shit/insulting about Hobi, Jin and Tae skills n wish our jmn to leave bts pls don't interact with her n BLOCKED
I love Min Yoongi's beautiful mind. It seems that recent interviews are slowly directed on tapping the thoughts, insights and values of the members. It helps in gaining gp's respect towards @BTS_twt . Kudos to their UN speech and interviews w Grammy and Time!
highkey annoyed at kpoop stans’ tweets disregarding bts’ time cover and un speech saying they dont deserve it cuz only “hormonal teenage girls” love them like... how toxic must u be to disregard incredibly good deeds from 7 people just bc they arent ur faves
Well said; plus I am still having a damn hard time to introduce BTS to my friends ; they dgaf about them just bcz they r Korean & sings in Korean; it's a thing; only un speech cud grab some attention; it's never fuccin easy for BTS it's their lyrics & msg reached to the needed
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/RgAhveBHpzI?a [SectionTV KPOP] Reaction to BTS UN Speech vid from MBC enmt news show!
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
im still not over the fact that my prof in english included an article about @BTS_twt ‘s UN speech in our english exam for the whole fcking batch to read like, I WAS SO PROUD WHILE READING IT IM LIKE THATS MAH BOYYYSSS
I even said you gave a speech at the UN called Speak YOURLSEFL and you did a campaign with the boys in UNICEF too love Myself #ENDviolence I love you every day you are my example to follow, my inspiration of every day to achieve my dreams.
Before he watched the UN speech and saw them in the papers he couldn't be bothered too but I guess now he realised BTS is more than just a kpop group :')
"we don't prioritize a certain country's achievements over the others" weren't you the ones that prioritize the daesang over anything else bts has won bc exo had the most daesang? weren't you the ones that complained how 'doing a speech for UN is nothing'
sdhfbs i got my history/world politics teacher excited about BTS he told me he would look into them and their UN speech after he got home today IM SO EXCITED IMAGINE IF HE JOINS THE FANDOM
the ugly truth is, the western media only cares so much about giving kpop the right exposure. they've seen what bts is about, largely thanks to the un speech. other groups simply didn't and couldn't gain that right kind of attraction. that's why they "largely failed"
i just made my mom watch the bts un speech and listen to love myself with vietsub and she really liked it ahhh i’m so happy
Used Namjoon's UN speech today in the English classes I teach as a volunteer project here at the local Dutch school. Watch the vid and had the kids translate each line. They loved the speech. So proud of being able to use my love for BTS in a classroom! @BTS_twt @bts_bighit
I was writing Euphoria's lyrics on a paper, writing "Jungkook" and "BTS" with it. And my seatmate (as he likes to call me) was like, "they're the group who had a speech in the UN right?" And I was like "YES! That was them." And he said the speech was beautiful and he spoke of-
Not...nearly as much...yall acting like a dj just apologized for his xenophobic statements and we're still trying to get a US reporter to apologize for saying bts "spreads their legs for fans" and disregarding their UN speech just because they're a boyband.
So strange that they didn't mention the UN speech at all and so many other achievements... but yay for #1! It's what Joonie deserves...
they also want BP's and E*o albums....ANYWAY. I just told her about my opinion on E and how BTS is the only group I stan bc of their meaningful lyrics and their campaign with unicef and their speech at the un which she hasn't heard of from those girls...no-jams....
Graham Norton praised us for being really nice towards the other guests because he knew we were there for BTS. Whoopi was so nice to BTS like she really loved them she even gave JK her shirt . Graham talked about them on the Time magazine and their speech at the UN.
Apparently I have to critically analyse literally anything for my assignment... So what do I do? Namjoon's UN speech? BTS in general? Their work with unicef and the love yourself campaign? Would that be too hard? Burn the stage series? WHAT DO I DO
"They have racked up two US No 1 albums and billions of global streams, and were recently invited to the UN as Unicef ambassadors, where their charismatic leader, RM, made a speech, in English, on self-acceptance." #PCAs #BTS @BTS_twt #TheSong #IDOL
Here, latin pop is what's thriving here. But if you ask any ARMY around, they will tell you they know BTS but not any other kpop group. Literally, my dad got to know about them because news and liked their music. Then UN speech came and that sealed the deal~
They showed clips from Idol and RMs UN speech and "Kpop Sensations becomes Global sensation" or something and quickly talked about how popular they are. Couldnt hear much as I was at work and was having a minor spaz ahah
So i hv my phone back after camp n idk if anyones gonna read this but there was a talkshow during this dedication camp n the guest speaker SHOWED RM'S SPEECH AT THE UN it felt like a dream icb bts has gone this far to the point that theyre being showed to my whole grade i was -

They are! They're invited to give speech for @_GenUnlimited launching, UN & Unicef new project for youth. They also partnered with unicef for @bts_love_myself campaign to #ENDviolence. 3% of their Love Yourself album & LY merch will go to Unicef.https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1006551707885551622?s=19 …
They know I'm an army, because every day I'm talking about BTS when we were gathering and I even show them all the video music including when Namjoon give speech in the UN. (I missed the news at that time)

I showed Namjoon’s UN speech to my mum and she doesn’t know much about BTS but it actually made her cry, she was so moved by his words and how genuine he was.
I DELIVERED MY OWN SPEECH ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND JOON'S SPEECH AT THE UN AND BIJJ I GOT 99 #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt
Well.. there is always a reason why BTS is on TIME's cover Do you think "just speech at UN" is just an ordinary speech ? U dont know the impact of them ? Haha read news dont just gaming man
Well there is always a reason why bts is on time's cover Do you think "just speech at UN" is just speech ? U dont know the impact of them ? Ah i know.. all of the things u care about is just the ambitious of being a "good" doctor haha bullshit
I FEEL YOU. A FRIEND KNWS I LOVE BTS AND TAGGED ME IN THE UN SPEECH AND YESTERDAY ON THE TIME FB PAGE.
What make me proud is this is #BTS who made the historical speech at UN!!! Now you know why ARMY love @BTS_twt their diversity!!!

Ikr!! I thought the same too. But I m glad they are getting the coverage this early. Their impact on the biggest music market in the world the UN speech really made UK take them seriously. I m so happy. Hope they get mainstream in UK soon and they get good promo in Germany too
I met my old friend and she said she is Army now. When I ask what era that brings her to stan @BTS_twt, her answer is quite surprising. It's not Her or Tear or Answer, but "BTS' UN speech." #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs
Is this the same person who gave that powerful speech at UN GA back that day??
Yes. He is Kim namjoon. The one who has the most wonderful speech in UN. I Love him
this big acc shading bts and they’re mutuals with jimtobergcf aka the person who shaded joons UN speech, and talked shit about... — i have jikookgcf blocked lmfaoo https://curiouscat.me/jungooooo/post/675379914?1539311776 …
My nan just rushed up to me really excited to tell me that she watched BTS on TV and she 'quite likes' them and watched RM's UN speech. I'm not sobbing YOU ARE.
Anyway joonieeee. I showed my dad ur speech at the UN. He said ur English VERY GOOD.
he’s the leader of BTS, who make a speech at UN in front of all world leaders, receiving bunch of awards, got a cultural medal and a congratulatory as well as a custom watch from the korean president but after all he is just an ordinary man who have a soft spot for pokemon :’) pic.twitter.com/OgSh7eoQSG
I heard of 1Direction but i wasn’t into their music much. I stanned tokio hotel before BTS. But i tell you, i have never stanned artist as hard as I do with BTS. Because they’re MORE than just singers/performers with catchy music. Have any of those group gave their speech at UN?
[ENG] BJC worldnews quoted @BTS_twt The media commented on the impact of the group on the industry and its achievements such as the speech at the UN, the large number of views on YouTube and how its message is transmitted around the world.
Even after all the success from AMAs, BBMAs and all the American shows in between, after BTS' speech at the UN, it was like we were back to square one. pic.twitter.com/A806x8P9fd
'the first' 'the most' 'the biggest' etc *of course in a good ways* Those are the relatable words to @BTS_twt Invited to UN speech, breaks many guinness world record, and Lots of incredible achievements. But i don't understand how some people still deny BTS impact *sigh
The UN speech was truely a turning point for BTS in terms of how theyre viewed within the media. These days, most articles aknowledge BTS' positive messages n dont cut them out as a kpop phase. They have become artists, muscians... a resident in the industry rather than a guest
My y’all MY DAD WATCHED RMs SPEECH AT UN, lyrics to LOVE YOURSELF AND NO, he’s willing to read more come through with SONGS I SHOULD LET HIM READ!!! #BTS #BTSSONGS
Pause. My brother sent ME a bts video when 2 weeks ago I couldn’t even get him to watch the UN speech pic.twitter.com/JDzFHanVIf
Sorry Mike, but they're right. And BTS very well deserves it. If anyone is going to surpass the Beatles, its them. They promote loving yourself and positive mental health. They have been able to do what no other foreign band has ever done. They gave an incredible speech at the UN
Thier the leaders of the Next Generation they're the world's biggest boy band that's music has very deep messages they also made a speech at the UN pic.twitter.com/F7jD0Oax5w
What I love is how they brought up the UN Speech and clips of how they're helping fans. It gives them a positive light to the general public.
omg bts were spoken about on bbc news and they mentioned their speech at the un and called them one of the worlds most influential groups i’m so proud fuck
I highly recommend that you watch the UN speech of the leader of BTS.
I think the UN speech made people take them seriously. Then being invited on the Graham Norton Show proved that their celebrity status is real and not made up. Being featured on the TIME magazine just cemented everything.
she loves their music too but doesnt stan like i do. it was so warming to hear her actually being happy for me for finding group that i feel that can help me and she was amazed how amazing bts are doing, using their career to help people?? like Joon's un speech and lyrics and all
Wore my BTS hoodie today and met another ARMY at a restaurant. We started talking about how amazing they are from their speech at the UN to their recent concerts. If that ain’t beautiful then I don’t know what is. These are the pure moments I live for.
BECAUSE HER CLOTHES LINE HAS A LOT OF COMMUNITY MESSAGES WHILE GRAHAM MENTIONED THEM GIVING A SPEECH AT THE UN #BTS #GRAHAMNORTON #GRAHAMNORTONSHOWhttps://twitter.com/autumnnightbts/status/1050487254911733760 …
My mom just watched Namjoons UN speech and literally fell in love with him and keeps repeating “he’s such a sweet boy” #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #IDOL #BTS   @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/uWXF9UeSyf
@RTLLateNight please don’t say ignorant stuff about BTS, they mean a lot to many people and they’ve helped tons of people (not only screaming 12 year olds as the media likes to portray us). Talk about their love yourself campaign with unicef or their speech at the UN instead
Listen, I get appearances on Jimmy Fallon and Graham Norton show because those do benefit BTS. The UN speech and the France-Korean companionship are important as well but interviews aren't necessary and overwork the boys since they have to either be there really early or late.
The great coverage via Fallon, America's Got Talent, & Good Morning America definitely helped. But I think it was the UN speech and now the TIME mag cover that legitimizes BTS and frames their narrative as more than your typical boy band. That speech got great WW coverage
The UN speech was a beautiful message that gave hope to so many people around the world :(( and it also really did wonders for bts to be taken seriously
We're getting more and more positive articles after the UN speech happened, perhaps people are finally realising they cannot paint bts as a teenage sensation anymore
It will get their name out there for sure, but I don't think it will have the same impact as the UN speech (especially if there is no itw of them) +
You're making me wonder if the diplomatic event in Paris could have a similar effect in that market as the UN speech. I hope French & European ARMY capitalize on that. Also idk the current political climate, but they've also got @BTS_twt & Macron both receiving the merit awards.
Agreed!! I was hoping for that ripple effect! (& thank you UN speech!) Now, may the UK promos lead to other great media coverages
Lovely report on @BTS_twt from @BBCNews including the UN speech and ARMYs stories. That’s what we like to see! pic.twitter.com/TtHARvvJoc
Wow from the future diplomatic meeting from the SK President... The UN speech due to their impact globally... Recognized for their Hangul promotion on the world, 2 M album sales in the streaming era, the time magazine and now on BBC... Wow thank you for this!
ARMY: "When I watched RM's UN speech it really hit me. He was talking abt how he didn’t accept some thgs abt himself - so I realised I needed to accept where I’m frm cos I used to be embarrassed abt it since I was bullied for being Somalian. Now I just embrace it & it’s cool.” pic.twitter.com/QriLCAdvaQ
BTS are basically an important part of global politics now also im doing a whole ass written assignment on BTS' UN speech in my IB english class, they rlly gonna save my grades
The LOVE YOURSELF albums also included a collaborative campaign w/ @UNICEF LOVE MYSELF which started in Nov 2017, raising more than $1M for their #EndViolence campaign & culminating in RM’s touching speech @the UN. There, RM coined a NEW MANTRA of ACCEPTANCE: “SPEAK YOURSELF”. pic.twitter.com/Hd76b1tALa
BTS WERE JUST ON BBC NEWS AND THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE UN SPEECH AND SOLD OUT CONCERT DATES
You can even use Malala. She was a youth exposed to violence. And she shared her story at the UN. Then use @BTS_twt Namjoon's UN speech as one of the textual reference, 'cause he was talking about sharing your own story. Being brave, being confident, accepting who you are n r nt.
He's the leader of @BTS_twt and one of the rappers of the group. He was the one who gave a speech at the UN for their UNICEF campaign. https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
เขียนดีมาก I could not agree more that this is such a touching article like RM’s speech at UN @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/NoiseyMusic/status/1050397851019333634 …
really feels like there always has to be duality with bts. we got the un speech then we got that fortnite challenge. we got the time cover then we got them shouting about anime and pokemon
UN speech, Time, Full Citi Field ...I need time to process everything BTS is writing history and I'm so proud.
Too many interviews to catch up on. Omoh. And so far they are all good! More deeper look on what the boys really want to say to the world. Maybe this is because of the UN speech. #BTS #PCAs #TheSong #Idol
i cant believe you said that when a whole UN GA speech was done by the leader of BTS. Love yourself, love myself, peace. pic.twitter.com/cx3Va6Di4p

My brother loves BTS so much. He prepared full size posters of Namjoon's entire speech with their photo at UN & is going to stick on their "all-boys" school's main decoration board. He said "fuck fragile masculinity and xenophobia, I will promote BTS among boys in my school". I-
I like promoting BTS to my staffnurses. I’m so proud showing them Namjoon speech at the UN. Hopefully can turn some of them to an Army
bts in 2018: Gave UN speech, 2 #1 albums, 1 #10 song, quintuple million seller, on Times, on ellen, fallon, gma, kimmel and etc, sold out stadium tours, cultural merit award, 3 gold riaa, double platinum riaj etc etc e: xo
I know definitely BTS has broken the barrier and paved the way, but that in no way means others are flopping stop saying that shit for likes and to spread hate, the guys literally had a whole UN speech and ya'll still talking shit to spread hate, what sense do you make? -_-
Wow, everyone is doing such an amazing job! There are so many beautiful comments, and I’ve noticed a number of people saying they checked out @BTS_twt after hearing the UN speech. Of course there are still haters, but they’re being drowned out by love.
Just tell them, BTS Lyricism appeal and relatable to lots of people especially people who struggle so much in their life. BTS is like a movement for Generation Unlimited. Insert UN Speech and maybe some lyric of their song like Tomorrow, lost etc
I summed up BTS and Namjoon’s speech at the UN to my datefriend last night : the whole Speak Yourself concept and how BTS was about to enter a new era. They looked at me and just told me “someone’s gonna come out”. jdbdbsb I love them
So what are their basis of disbanding BTS? 1.BTS OUTSOLD ALMOST ANY THING 2.BTS GIVES HONOR & PRIDE TO SK /Speech in UN etc. 3.BTS DOMINATES THE WORLD WITH THEIR MUSIC ETC..SO Bcoz of these THEY ARE DYING OF JEALOUSY go for petition duh!
Mayhaps I used BTS’s UN speech as a source in one of my papers
You can watch the grammy interview and UN speech on YouTube
Joined this fandom a bit more than a year and back.....that time they were just the guys who had just won a billboard social artist award....and now they are invited to give a speech in the UN....I’m crying....this makes me SO Happy. But they deserve all of it.That’s how u adult.
Any Army here knows when @TIME gonna release their mag cover with @BTS_twt ? And is that diplomatic event BTS gonna attend with the President of South Korea gonna be live stream? Wanna 're watch their @UN speech & @RecordingAcad intimate interview aswell, any links?
Idk when they stopped being my friends I think it was after i heard they're nominated for People's awards and gonna do a speech at UN! Then came the GMA & now the Time magazine! It makes me sad and idk what happened either, but bts stopped being my friends & feel so far away now pic.twitter.com/NlH12k5Ev8
Thank you BTS!!! I wrote a blog about your speech at the UN.... keep inspiring and bring positivity! @bts_bighit https://janepearllee.com/high-self-esteem-doesnt-work-self-love-does/ …
Yooo promote RMs speech at the UN , I'm sure they won't sleep on that too! It's very inspiring/educational
@UN bts member jimin was wearing T shirt with pictures of atomic bombing in Japan. it is not acceptable and he should be ashemed of what he has done. please do not invite them ever again. they do not have a right to give a speech at UN. pic.twitter.com/9Mara7A0Yl
Lrt. @BTS_twt, The Next Generation Leaders, having a speech at the UN, no wonder they are the Korea Pride #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS
not to be that person but our family are proud of @BTS_twt for giving a beautiful speech at the UN, or just think about our own achievements. donating, planting trees, etc, while our haters are proud of making their friends a bts and army anti. the difference... wow.
Twitter keeps showing these as the most recent pictures I’ve saved when it’s been two weeks since the UN speech,, my phone’s and army y’all #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/9kh8Y8XqWC
story time: our english teacher made us summarize an article about bangtan’s UN speech in our exams bts antis in our batch can choke
@timesofindia please do some research...they are not BTS. How can someone be so reckless. I thought they can be easily recognised after the UN speech. But huh...
Anyway, bts news are surging since their UN speech. Fortunately i can keep up with those.

The First Lady watched her sons made an inspirational speech at UN and now the President will watch his sons performing at Korean-French meeting Im so fking proud omg #BTS #TheGroup #PCAS @BTS_twt
Jealous that BTS got those special presidential watches after they made a speech at the UN.? Or because they were awarded the Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit for promotion of national culture worldwide? or because Love Yourself: Answer sold over 2 million copies worldwide? hmmm
Chill 1.BTS has actually apologized for everything they had did wrong. RM apologized again in his UN speech. You can pretty much google it and their apologies will pop up. 2.taeyongs apology choose to believe it or not. https://youtu.be/SwBkVNGGI14 Stop the "but bts" crap its old.
Going to promote BTS at class tomorrow THE UN SPEECH IS REALLY USEFUL wml It's what they deserve #BTS⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠ #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt
Today we had 5 minutes left of class so we decided to show our 6th graders @BTS_twt UN speech. They’re currently working on a project pic.twitter.com/t9WOyi8H2S
That's so amazing!!! A lot of my non bts fan friends were also interested because of the UN speech. It really elevated them
other fandoms swear up and down armys r always the ones playing the victim when ive seen so many tweets today criticizing how it shouldnt be bts on times magazine. when joon gave their UN speech, kpopies couldnt WAIT to call it/bts basic and slander their name under locals twts +
@bts_bighit @BigHitEnt ISTG yall better milk this moment and brag come on!!! It aint hard. Just plaster their faces with Time everywhere in south career and put the UN speech too uwu pic.twitter.com/FOqE0s74be
tbh my mom never paying any attention and always get mad at me everytime i fangirl because she thought that i'll waste my time and neglect my studies, buTtttt @BTS_twt is an exception. she literally whipped over them after un speech. preach to next leader generation.
Army Ego - BTS will get medal from Order of Cultural Merits - BTS UN speech - BTS Time Magazine's as next Generation Leaders - BTS is the first k-act to win a AMA - LY Answer is CERTIFIED 2M by Gaon - LY Answer is CERTIFIED platinum RIAJ - BTS 1st US staduim concert Citifield pic.twitter.com/dz5sxrmuOS
I cannot believe these are the same @BTS_twt who I laughed with at RUN BTS episodes because they're so chaotic, who I admire for their high caliber performances and who touched the world with their UN speech. I will never shut up of how proud and lucky to be born in this era. pic.twitter.com/HvrnQGDigX
UN speech Korean Merit Cultural Order TIME magazine Certified 2M Pure sellers Etcetc... Is there a limit??? All this happened in 2 weeks wtf I'm scared @BTS_twt
Anyways check out bts’s times cover and UN speech! pic.twitter.com/D9F9StOvON
Ahhh perfect. Next time anyone tries to tell me that these men aren’t legends, I’ll just show them this, and their unicef campaign, and the UN speech. You don’t have to like their music but respect them for what they’ve done. pic.twitter.com/N46PZSXOlO
What @BTS_twt has done in 2018 so far... BBMAs, Top Social Artist x Performance IDOL, most viewd video 24hrs Speech at the UN BTS x Jimmy Fallon BTS x Ellen BTS x GMA BTS x AGT AMAs Favorite Social Artist #BTSxTime : NEXT GENERATION LEADERS And we are living at the same time
It kills me when no one in my real life cares about BTS because I so badly want to bring up the UN Speech, the TIME cover, the selling out stadiums, and the message of self-love. I need to brag about them!! #BTS ⁠ ⁠ #PCAs #IDOL #TheSong
From August 2018 to now for BTS: - release of ly answer - idol mv scores fastest views in 24 hours for a YouTube music video - billboard hot 200, top 100 - start of ly tour (and breaking records at citifield) - speech at UN
did you get ian to watch bts un speech
Hello, I’m sorry but no one can compare to bts, not korean artists or kpop groups, when they have a speech at the UN call me, when there on the cover of TIME magazine and have an interview call me, when they have a interview at the Grammy museum and multiple billboard awards
listen i've been reading transcripts and highlights of everything bts has done this year i can't bring myself to watch/read any of their interviews i know i'll break down i still haven't watched the un speech i've only read the transcript :/
Im from the USA..what did you expect? and of course I know BTS has done soo much globally too and in their OWN country...did you know 3% of their Love Yourself albums/sales is donated to the UNICEF compaign to end violence on children and teens? They made a speech at the UN?
Explain BTS to them and mention their UN speech. Tell them that after this concert you will become even better because you have a stronger life motivation etc
“They have choreographed moves “ when he didn’t focus on their speech at the UN. About loving and accepting yourself. He downgraded them .thats why we want an apology. He also , was using them for clout last year for the AMAs and bbmas. So where is the hypocrisy now ?
Calling bts idiots while bts is out here giving a speech at the UN receiving cultural awards. Try again hoe
"My idol represented the youths and gave a speech at UN, the speech was 6 minutes long, and the Fansite that took the photo of them is Cheong Wa Dae" MY ARMY EGO #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/z6itN74S0X
I voted for #BTS for #TheSocialCelebrity of 2018 because the UN speech gave a new meaning to any and all awards about a 'social' award. Cast your vote for the E! People's Choice Awards at #pcas
Going back to Namjoon's UN speech, BTS are resilient today b/c of what they experienced & endured in the past - adversity, hate, & learning from mistakes. BTS was ready for the xenophobia & prejudice before they arrived in the US. Resilience isn't inherent; it's built over time
My brother was saying how in his class the professor asked if any of them watched the UN Speech and asked if any of them have heard of bts b/c they were there.
im promoting bts’ un speech in my report for school,, it is out of context but i can do it and i will do it
I’M SCREAMING MY GRANDPA JUST CALLED ME OVER TO THE TV BECAUSE BTS WAS ON THE NEWS WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT THE WORLD TOUR, COLLAB AND UN SPEECH (it’s a singapore local news channel btw) pic.twitter.com/h3dwo4z6xa
this one also mentioned the UN speech (ugh truly iconic)((a moment for the history books!!))(((groundbreaking!!!!))) and how it managed to bring bts to a whole new area of the GP <333
IM CRYING THEYRE ON TV AGAIN!!! THEY TALKED ABOUT BTS AND THEIR SOLD OUT TOUR AND THE UN SPEECH pic.twitter.com/cMo4Z9M3oO
Anw BTS are still the ones who’s making Korea proud bc of their achievements from ww charts, UN speech that the first lady was so proud of & gave them bluehouse watches & the ones who got the Order of Culture Merit from Korean government for spreading Korean culture & language.
my history teacher from last year stopped me in the hallway yesterday and apologized for making fun of bts. he said he saw their speech at the un and started watching videos about them, and came to the conclusion they aren’t just a boyband. antis, take hints
A dental senior asked me why I liked BTS so much cuz they look pretty much the same to her. But she did see the video I posted of Namjoon’s speech at the UN so I PROUDLY explained to her how much I look up to him & their music carries a deep meaning & how much they mean to me.
Anyways bts stays winning with a full korean albums and getting a merit award from the blue house for spreading korean culture and taking a speech at the UN to rise awareness and spreading positive message.
What’s amazing is that RM taught himself English, members of bts are learning a second language & are doing mighty fine. Oh they got invited to speak at the UN yeah the United Nations and delivered a powerful speech in English https://twitter.com/baekiiebobohu/status/1049849585391296513 …
Earlier I was arguing w/ my classmate about bts and he said that he was going to bash bts then I told him "Bangtan left a legacy by giving a speech for UN and helping Unicef and reminding us to love ourself. What does your existence contribute in our world?"
Your faves can speak english but BTS is the one that got 1 on BB 200 two times , BTS is the one that occupied top 10 spots in US itunes at the same time , BTS is the one that have 4 entries in BB hot 100 and BTS is the one that delivered a speech at UN in short-
So basically, they were saying how BTS is coming to Singapore to perform next year at our national stadium, their US success, collar with nicki, Europe tour and UN speech
My friends aren’t into BTS or Kpop. They only know BB. It’s okay though, I’m not going to force them. One did admit that he was impressed with Namjoon’s UN speech though!
Me ha gustado un vídeo de @YouTube (http://youtu.be/5GH9UNc46TQ?a - 180312 BTS BEST FAN ARMY SPEECH IHEART MUSIC AWARDS).
meanwhile, my mom when i said bts was presenting a speech at the UN : “oh. cool” SKSJSSJS
PLESE READ THIS ARMYs! This is the reason why @BTS_twt are special, why we love them, what everyone who doesn't understand our passion for BTS can learn where it does come from and why so many are saying BTS heals or saves them, why the UN speech resonated so deeply in us. https://twitter.com/HeidiSamIAm/status/1049440122066874368 …
Found a local’s post on instagram about Namjoon’s UN speech. I feel so proud of you, @BTS_twt!! #BTS #PCAs #TheGroup #MentalHealthMatterspic.twitter.com/FUajlT7TGM
#BTS started everything from here not from the Red Carpet. That's why RM said in UN speech "Some people might not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless" but look at them now... #BTSwinAMAs #AMAs @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/UvpawEAfdO
I was talking abt BTS and their UN speech and here's what I was told: "if you don't know the legends than you're cool" "So what?" "Hmm" "You're always like this" I don't even try to talk abt them anymore with anyone apart from my mum (she's an ARMY)
Ho aggiunto un video a una playlist di @YouTube: http://youtu.be/CV3Tah_Sgkk?a BTS Love Yourself World Tour London: Final Speech and Answer:
I love how they chose the UN Speech photo, representing what BTS really are to many people - an inspiration.
Even after their speech at the UN, many articles referred to the as the first kpop group to do that, when it wasn’t and isn’t a context where every kpop group get to take turns to do.
*sigh* you could be right about that. (non-Army here) Could it also be the reason for quite a few other songs of BTS, like 'Dope'? Or even speech at the UN? If I see that, you're not going to school to learn something, but just to pass a test. That's ... no fun.
I think I don't send my point with my weak english. I'm sorry, I was referring to making interviews with specific targets, just as they did on this occasion, not just doing interviews with each radio station, I mean the UN speech I help a lot with the locals and they started to+
This morning i shared bts’ speech at the UN on facebook and NOW MY MOM SHARING IT TOO DKSKX DN D pic.twitter.com/x3bsf3cvlC
In 2018 alone, @BTS_twt won 4 Daesang, 75 awards, got 3 gold RIAA, got double platinum RIAJ, 2 gold RIAJ with korean album, gained 3B views 4.5M sales on Gaon & two #1 albums, Top10 on BB, performed at BBMAs, AGT &GMA got invited to the Grammy Museum, gave a speech at the UN.
Sent one of my best friends Namjoon’s UN speech to remind her to be true to herself.Trouble is I’m not sure if the number I sent it to is hers so either I sent it to her to introduce her to BTS or I sent it to a stranger who’s gonna wonder wtf it is either way I’m doin gods work.
That’s true, no matter what achievement they get it will never be enough. I swear BTS can win a grammy and people will say “who cares it’s just one grammy” because they like to make their achievements seem useless. UN speech? Trash. But if it was their favs they’d be so happy.
Congratulations @BTS_twt ! Well deserved! The UN speech is a perfect case in point of how their Social Media presence is used to benefit a cause bigger than all of us, that of @_GenUnlimited . The amount of exposure it got to the target market is a big win for the project.
If you don't believe me, read an excerpt of the speech at d UN by Kim Namjoon of BTS "I used to imagine that I was a superhero,who could save the world. And in an intro to one of our early albums, there is a line that says,“My heart stopped when I was maybe nine or ten"
i plan on telling him why i love bts and gna show him rm's speech at un then I'll say i wna go to their concert bcs they make me love myself
So, the embassy tweets about @BTS_twt's AMAs win BUT NOT about their impactful UN speech, which received positive press all over the world? The embassy needs to sort its priorities . . . or is it because BTS' speech would highlight Trump's dismal reception at the UN?
Good luck at work tomorrow! And thank you, her name is Buttercup and she’s a little rat terrier Also, have you seen their UN speech? I highly suggest watching it when you get a chance to (it’s about 7 minutes long)
Alright...Time to write a new letter to #RM @BTS_twt to congratulate him on his UN speech, Citi Field and #AMAs even if my letters always get stuck into the transit limbo. One day they'll make it
Joon's @BTS_twt UN speech and Citifield ending ment.
America only knows a BTS. Do you see Kpop getting #1 on Billboard 200? Do you see Kpop getting in the Top 10 in the Billboard Hot 100? No other Kpop artist has gotten CLOSE to the amount of sales BTS has in the US. Has Kpop done a speech at the UN? So tell me again who is famous
Namjoon full speech at UN @BTS_twt #BTS #GenUnlimited #UNGA #ENDviolence #YOUTH2030https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
Sorry I took a million years but...I watched one MV ("Idol") by #BTS recently. I can see why everyone likes them. I saw a few videos but I wasn't hooked. Then I was impressed with their speech at the UN. (1)
a dude humiliates an army for only liking bts, a journalist decreases the impact of Namjoon's UN speech, a radio host calls their song "noise", radios won't play their songs, and so on and so forth... Now I ask: where, just WHERE was all that energy then?
Just because there is a group of Korean men or just a group of asian men in general does not mean its BTS. That is pushing the stereotype that "all asians look the same". Anyways listen to Joon's speech at UN https://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak
Me gustó un video de @YouTube http://youtu.be/jNWbEsKK2PM?a BTS 'Won Favourite Social Artist' Award at AMA's 2018 (Acceptance Speech)
Racist words? Please explain. I wasn't gonna bring this up but BTS' group leader RM said "No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, Speak Yourself" at the UN General Assembly speech. And you call them racists? Really blind.
Eng trans: @NRKno wrote about @BTS_twt who're topping US charts,and that they're having concerts in London! They also mention that BTS have been to the biggest US shows and also held a speech at @UNMusicologist @audunmolde believes BTS will come to Norway to Telenor Arena!
I don't have to think about a lot of things that's stressing me right now. Hey, at least BTS songs help me go through it. They taught me to #LoveMyself "Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me." - RM of BTS, UN #GenUnlimited Speech
Someone should write about what that @kendisgibson said about BTS and RM. He was mocking RM’s accent during the UN speech. He’s straight up xenophobic, and racist. #ihatesnakeu
Did I just write an article about Namjoon and his fantastic UN speech? Did I talk about how important it was and how incredible Namjoon is? Of course I did. @BTS_twt #Namjoon #rmismyanswerhttps://beat.media/bts-at-the-united-nations-generation-unlimited-summit …
I’m so disappointed in some of our BTS ARMY. Guys when was it okay to hate people for what they did or have said in the past? Do you guys not remember what RM’s speech meant for the UN? BTS is great because they promote love and peace for everyone. RM said
“I believe my damn voice will one day be spread” - I Believe, RM I’m still not over his UN speech. I wonder if Joon would’ve ever guessed just how widespread his voice has become. #BTS #RMpic.twitter.com/OmdiU6SNiU
I was thinking last night...due to BTS a group of people (k-poppies) also got to know about the UN speech , which I think is pretty amazing, I'm sure that they also analyzed it and did some research of the event.

so, today I spoke about the speech of bts at the UN's in my english class
Bts is making a HUGE impact right now after their UN speech which left many people crying from the GP and it's gaining every day more and more awards and well deserved recognition
@Schofe you said you didn’t know who @BTS_twt were... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pBuZEGYXA6E … Their latest single in the last album of their love yourself era - they did a version with @NICKIMINAJ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y … the link to their speech at the UN with @UNICEF
2 weeks ago today, #RM , w/ the support of all #BTS members, delivered a historic speech at the UN on behalf of Generation Unlimited. This is a brutal reminder of how fast time goes by but also a wake up call to do something. #SpeakYourself today! So proud of @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTSchPL_board/status/1047126482013892609 …
FHATS SO... whole bts family get along like imagine talkn bout ur son having a speech at the UN and ur other son having a best friend relationship w jimmy Fallon on the plane to london.
Yes bigger. Did the other groups give a speech at the UN, are goodwill ambassadors for UNICEF, teach the world to sing in Korean, put Korea on the must-visit map? Did they (other than PSY) break records & make RIAA gold 3 times or #1 BB album 2x? @BTS_twt @bts_bighit did that!
Talking with my counselor today I explained why @BTS_twt has become such an important group to me, how this series is called #LoveYourself, how their lyrics reflect that phrase, and how they gave a speech at the UN for UNICEF on behalf of youths. She said that gave her chills.
@pitchfork actually got a korean to write their latest piece on @BTS_twt, who covered all aspects of their music from the genre bending music to socio-political messages of songs, from their UN speech to Seo Taiji passing the helm of kpop to BTS. thank you.
like yall keep comparing those trash ass locals with the group who went to the un give a speech, biggest bg rn in the world like get a grip your should be worried with w1 and nct. not bts when they surpassed yall long ago lmao
If there's any other korean group that could get to the level of BTS' popularity outside the US, it's BP. BTS has GP recognition now from the UN speech and local news reporting of sold-out arenas and CitiField.
especially najmoons speech at the UN really left me in such a loss for words. I felt so connected to them and I felt reassured to know they have experienced many things that we all do, on a day to day basis. and that’s what keeps me going. #PCAs #BTS⁠ ⁠ #TheGroup
in one article they mentioned the diversity of army and bts' music, namjoon's un speech, bts staying close to their korean culture, being socially and politically aware, bts being the biggest boyband in the world... MY PITCHFORK X BTS AGENDA IS THRIVING!!! https://twitter.com/pitchfork/status/1049676874455109633 …

Wow this article debunked so many incorrect perceptions about BTS. They are westernized? The UN speech was "cliché"? Psy paved the way? The recent commentry on their lyrics? This writer has all the answers. Thanks @noahyoo this was one of my favorite reviews for BTS so far pic.twitter.com/jCpbRJHIgd
PLEASE also of you interview them, ask about the UN Speech and their lyrics ! Pls they are helping millions of people to find, accept themselve and enjoying the life! Gosh I missed our bangtan so much IMAGINE THEM PERFORMING ON BIGGEST UK SHOW! PERIOD!!!
They made an impact on how some people view Korean music as a whole. At the end of the day, they do this for their country and their fans. If you think their un speech was meaningless then that is your thoughts but to say they can't possibly do anything outside of +
Which btw is what RM'S UN speech basically says but y'all out here spreading hate anyway so
i told my school therapist about bts and how they r literally my only source of happiness and about how they encourage people to love themselves hhhh i also told him to listen to namjoons UN speech owo im doing gods work
stanning bts is so wild u close ur eyes for a minute and theyre doing a speech at un u close it again and theyre founding a new planet
bts already got to the UN and have a speech there as the voice of the youth, won awards and are the first in idol group, breaking boundaries,etc. And why should y'all still paying attention to them and what they say?
WATCH ME USE NAMJOONS UN SPEECH AS MY MAIN TOPIC FOR MY MYP PERSONAL PROJECT LIKE LITERALLY wATcH mE ;) @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/sMufK7xxFq
@BTS_twt can i recommend what to read? "Instructions" by: Neil Gaiman i suddenly remember RM speech in UN...
Also even when bts started to get success in the US ppl didn’t understand why? other than bts have many fans but this is not true anymore. I think we shouldn’t underestimate the power of UN speech in delivering the message of bts music. It is very powerful beyond any promo.
[late post ] i payed a visit to my aunt earlier. my cousins were and i started playing bts songs. my aunt suddenly spoke up and said “i saw bts on the news. they had a speech at the UN assembly didn’t they?” i said yes. “the message of the speech was really beautiful-“ +
and then next slide on the ppt she played the video and I SCREAMED BC IT WAS BTS WHEN THEY GAVE A SPEECH IN THE UN SJJSKAKAK I INSTANTLY CRIED, IT FELT SO HEARTWARMING TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND WAS EVEN PRESENTED BY MY FAVE TEACHER
soo today in class we were discussing human dignity & self worth and my teacher showed us namjoon’s un speech. it made me realize even more how big bts’ impact is & i felt so happy & proud
OUR RELIGION TEACHER/ADVISER PLAYED BTS' UN SPEECH IN CLASS DAMN @BTS_twt IS REALLY ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND IM SO PROUD
Don't mention it. I'm flattered to meet the man who had delivered outstanding speech for UN. You did well there, truthfully saying. Anyhow, I've been good, though works are piling up as the promotion season comes How is BTS doing? Hectic as usual?
I guess the reporter know nothing abt BTS, calling RM, Suga's bandmate!! RM is BTS's Leader! And ALL BTS MEMBERS ARE INTERESTING! Why not talking abt their UN's speech or their collaboration with @UNICEF? Mocking non English speaker(Hardworking guys), is it the style of UK?
I don’t know why armies want an apology from that K*ndis G*bs*n ‘journalist’. y’all should just get him fired. His apology is not going to be genuine anyway .He thinks BTS is beneath him and shows lack of professionalism by mocking Namjoon’s UN speech. His ego is obvious.
I feel happy & proud of being a part of their journey & I feel happy & proud when it comes to BTS boyz. My prof. made me/ my Kpopper classmates emo when he mentioned abt Namjoon UN speech, Love Yourself Campaign, talking abt them & kpoppers without mocking, I'm just emo & happy.
AGT & GMA got invited to the Grammy Museum, gave a speech at the UN! Eye have to laugh BTS stays winning! Y'all can go whine filling petitions to validate your faves but it wouldn't work untill you actually devote your time TO YOUR FAVES now, would it?
[ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy” https://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak ข้อมูลจาก @YouTube
All big bands hv fanbase, different Kpop events etc. bt.... BTS&Army effect is different. I mean in a place where ppl don't gaf abt Kpop, Namjoon was trending on 6th on UN speech day, kids, adults (our Prof.) talk abt BTS, Kpop & ppl here now Kpop enthusiast & respect BTS & Kpop.
you gave a 6 minute speech at the UN HQ btw. THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL A GLOW UP.
20181007: Can u believe BTS has toured N. America, performed on Jimmy Fallon, AGT, GMA, Grammy museum, made speech @UN Conference, played a SOLD OUT stadium show all in just one month?! They are really breaking records after records, making history everyday True legends pic.twitter.com/0jjhIMlNxf
have references when I get asked, what’s BTS: AGT, Grammy Museum, UN Speech, Jimmy Fallon, GMA and CitiField, just in the past month! Last year, only one person I know, watched them perform DNA at the BBMAs.
Young Forever owns a special part in my heart. It emits a feeling of fear but also Hope. It always makes me emotional. This part of Hobi's verse is one of my favorites. It resonates to Joon's UN speech. #감사합니다_방탄소년단 #TheGroup #PCAs #BTS @BTS_twt I tried lol. pic.twitter.com/05YHr61GW2

She said she heard a lot of good things about @BTS_twt like how they are different from other groups. She talked about the UN speech.
Thank you so much! I've been struggling since Namjoon's UN speech to articulate why I've been so annoyed at the way the media is covering BTS and it finally all came together for me.
*Kpop groups have a comeback* Their fans: "Wow kings & queens! Amazing comeback! Way better than BTS! Oh and Mic Drop lyrics suck. And did yall hear their song IDOL? Awful. And did you see their outfits? Looked like beggars just like ARMYs. And their UN speech was so cring-" pic.twitter.com/QGIjkUnuhQ

As an RA, I have Namjoon's UN speech on my door for my residents to read @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/mhwTox6VbK
Ughh bts is attending that genie trash award. A group who did a whole UN speech deserves better
Thank you! Ever since Namjoon's UN speech, I have been trying to figure out why I was annoyed at the way people were being dismissive of BTS's message, and it all finally hit me last night in my post-concert depression.
I need a full UN speech of this
So for the essay I'm writing, I'm using RM's speech at the UN as one of my sources so I have it sitting next to me and it has rainbows all over it. It's hard to see in the picture but I thought it was worth sharing #BTS #방탄소년단 #ARMYpic.twitter.com/309tpDKg30
so many trash interviewers got the chance to interview our babies and that is not ok. they usually ask which artist bts wanna collab and some unimportant things. go ask them abt the UN speech, love yourself campaign, selling out citifield stadium and many other things smh
Why not let this reporter speak Korean, and we'll see if she could do it as fluently as Namjoon does when speaking English. To think that he had never been in a formal english class, but his speaking ability is tested already. Remember his UN speech?
remember when tl cried hard over bts during epiphany release and un speech, i like those times
Just showed my friend the UN speech but sigh she was distracted with a dude and completely dismissed it and now I sit here sad bc I failed once more in trying to get her a better opinion of BTS
- there's been so much that has happened for and spoken about bts and their music, message and themes. more recently namjoon's UN speech. that alone is an entire topic for discussion. there's more to them than who they want to collab with, favorite foods, celebrity crushes -
This is not why Namjoon did that UN speech. Everyone makes mistakes in their past. What matters that he admitted, apologized, and changed. Move on, y'all.
Can you believe this very man also delivered heartfelt deep speech at UN? #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS https://twitter.com/taecroissant/status/1049374724973912065 …
bro my mom showed her students the bts UN speech and then yesterday we watched the eric andre show w my dad and they loved it. Whats happening
fr and now more asian media is popping up, like kinjaz and freaking BTS gave a speech at UN
You should have linked their UN speech
I've came from the future, they become the biggest boyband on earth, give a speech at UN, sold out Citi Field, achieve #1 at billboard twice a year, and plot twist, you get to interview them on october 8th of 2018.
so my brother texted me about the un speech today and when i came home we both watched it again along with a few other bts interviews
While in line for #BTSinCitifield there was mom who was with her daughter. She was explaining how she surprised her daughter & brought her to the concert. She basically said before she didn't really didn't get it, but after the UN speech she was in full support of @BTS_twt
“what celebs in America do you like” “would you collab with any American artist” “what American foods do you like” LIKE NO TF SHE RIGHT ITS IRRITATING! If you wanna ask questions about America ask about there Stadium concert, or the UN speech! @BTS_twt deserves better! #BTS https://twitter.com/taexty/status/1049348728086126592 …
Korean boy group. Has sold over 4 million albums in 2018 alone. Gave a speech at the UN general assembly two weeks ago and recently became first korean artist to sell out a US stadium.
I really hope this interview has changed your mind about BTS. If not then pls watch UN SPEECH from RM himself. BTS has come a long way and has worked hard every single day. The least you can do is RESPECT!! They deserve nothing but love. GODBLESS!!!
Please ask them about their UN speech and nothing about thirst tweets..I repeat NO thirst tweets!!!!
Wait, are those the boys who had a speech at the UN Assembly,??
can y’all believe that this time two weeks ago we were all jittery n shit waiting for bts to deliver their speech at the UN
I’ll never get over namjoon's speech at the UN and I will never get tired of telling people abt it #PCAs + #TheGroup + #BTS⁠ + @BTS_twt
I think this will be one of multiple movies. I'm guessing a behind the scenes movie, one that shows not just ARMYs who they are, but the GP who have definitely become curious after their UN speech and a record breaking world tour :) A BTS origins movie in 5 years perhaps?
I compiled scenes from GCF and put namjoon’s UN speech #TheGroup #BTS  #PCAs @BTS_twt #rm #army #btsfaneditpic.twitter.com/E1PJu98Bof
BTS are the first Korean artists to perform on the Citi Field stadium and top on BB100. Did an important speech at UN and got called the best boy band in the world. Stop comparing other artists to them because BTS are on a whole other level
jus a share: SO LAST WEEK we had an individual speech for oral comm . and i took the chance to inform everyone about the UN’s Youth2030 :,) i also mentioned namjoon’s speech and bts’ campaign w unicef AND GUESS WHAT!! pic.twitter.com/6ItJSz5nDL
If ABC did see his comments about bts giving his speech at the UN as racist, then they would've fire him but unfortunately they don't. His comments was only a troll & nothing else. I'm not defending him at all. I do see other celebs get insulted on TV & not get fired.
Listen to the Speech of #BTS, the FIRST Korean singer to deliver a speech at the #UN General Assembly! #EntertainWeekly #방탄소년단 #kbsworldpic.twitter.com/kRpVKGrl7j
The work they do with UNICEF is amazing and RM's speech at the UN wow! I have to say for such a young band they have very wise heads on their shoulders, and the talent to go stellar. I hope they do.
They are still updated on local newspaper. See thison Phil. Star Sept. 26, there's an article about them on their UN speech. Thou its blurry, I got too excited. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/acgrlp66Ph
UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS OF @BTS_twt : –1st solo concert in SK –1st music show win –1st daesang –when they won on BBMAs –performances on huge shows in US –joon' UN speech –sold out concerts in huge stadiums –bts recieves the "Order of Cultural Merit" award add more armys!
fuckfjdj my friend said she watched one of those kpop dudes on un??? I said it’s bts and she said the speech was sO good and liked them?? like my irls hate kpop it’s so weird to meee
Bts will be on time magazine cover and the article that will be written is most probably about their works with unicef and the speech at UN. Time magazine is not a gossip magazine. It's TIME magazine. This is huge
I am not coaxing her into “YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO BTS NOW!!1!!!” But i am so glad the way she knows bts is from the un speech.. that’s like a whole new level of proud for me :”)
I’m thankful for @BTS_twt Not only do they produce quality music, their messages are sources of great comfort for young people. Their UN speech 2 weeks ago and their historic stadium concert in NYC CitiField last Friday are just a couple things that make their fans proud.
I don't know what happpened. But just want to inform that my mom is not mad at me anymore when I buy anything related to @BTS_twt hehehe did she watch the UN speech? If yes, all hail Kim Namjoon #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS
RM & BTS are leading the way to change the world in positive ways,&we have our part too ARMY! That night I turned 6 Ubers on to BTS & their message,referred them to the UN speech. Each said they would share w/their kids & friends One step at a time we can do this -adminT pic.twitter.com/oeDk9E6on9
One side BTS are spreading the word of LOVE, KINDNESS towards each other (also UN speech) and other side, I see this shit! #AMillionMuslims . every one should be treated equally.
First their speech in the UN. Then a sold out concert in Citi Field. And now they receive order of Cultural Merit from Korean Government. Proud is an understatement. @BTS_twt #BTS #BTSNationsPride #CultureMedalRecipientBTSpic.twitter.com/qm1HByIcFZ
my mom called just to say she saw a news segment on bts’ speech during the un ga lmao
nothing makes me happier than my mom showing enthusiasm towards bts. we're currently watching Namjoon's UN speech because my mom saw bts in the news and told me thats its been awhile and she wanted to catch up with them.
Today had some teacher come from Fullbright University came to my school to have a talk show.She talked about BTS, about RM’speech at UN and talked about did we love ourselves. I almost cry when I heard this, don’t know why but I think ‘cause I’m so proud of them @BTS_twt #RM
SHOW them the news and announcements of them receiving the medal! And make them watch Joon’s UN speech(if they are strict or whtever or if you haven’t already ahahah) I’m sure they won’t be able to say anything against the most successful youth influencers; Crossing fingers 4 u
Thank you for having them on! I can’t wait to watch them perform. If you get the chance to interview them, I was wondering if you could ask them about their speech at the UN Assembly. I’d love to hear more about that & the message behind their Love Yourself albums!
my male friends who dont like kpop always tease me they dont like BTS because they said kpop wear make up and all their music sounds same. I queitly let them listened and watched BTS UN speech.Their reaction was ahah they seems different actually. I had a huge smile. @BTS_twt
I'm unbothered with other antis after Namjoon's life-affirming UN speech, tbh. But I've HAD IT with these racist journalists who, cos they can't attack his message, attack his english instead. I've been saying that racism would be our next hurdle as Armys now that BTS is global.
I don't care what you think about BTS, but you can have nothing but respect for them, particularly Kim Nam-joon (AKA "RM") after the speech he gave at the UN. He exudes pure confidence and really exemplifies how BTS isn't just any K-pop group or boyband.… https://ift.tt/2QB6rIB
i can't with you hhhh those award shows better give bts an awards that they deserve or i'm gonna burn down their building. anw i'm waiting for namjoon un's speech to get the nobel peace prize he deserve or i have an event planned!
Every morning, we start our day by doing preliminary activity such as watching inspirational videos conducted by our teacher in technical writing and today, I asked her to let my classmates watch RM's UN speech. @BTS_twt #TheGroup #BTS #PCAspic.twitter.com/TzgOpjy4nh
You know what's funny? When I see other K-Pop fans say that BTS songs are bad uh, then please explain all the awards their winning worldwide. Also sales, the UN speech, the interviews with famous people, the amazing collaborations, and there's so much evidence! @BTS_twt
But sometimes I can't resist to post something about them in IG, especially about their speech in UN
BIG CONGRATS FOR ALL ARTIST YOU MENTION, but please dont close ur eyes. I think BTS gain more GP esspecially in USA, its not about music they are speech on UN, got number #1 in BB200 and many more.
Are kpoppies seriously comparing a UN speech and a REAL world tour with a stadium in NY with what exactly? I wasn't interested in korea until I met BTS and so was half of my country, they deserve that because they have CULTURAL MERIT so stfu
2018 is magical and def BTS' year: - Gave a speech at UN - Invited to Grammy Museum for an interview - Performed at Citifield - Youngest to receive the Order of Cultural Merit - Were invited as guests in all the top rated shows like Ellen, AGT, Jimmy Fallon show and others
24 is bts day or what? 24/8 ly:answer 24/9 UN speech 24/10 https://twitter.com/BTSARMY_Salon/status/1049200486119657472 …
How I'm finally about to sleep knowing BTS are the youngest recipients/the only group to receive the Order of Cultural Merit following a UN speech & a historic sold out Citi Field concert, continue to prosper, be god's favorite children, & be the leaders of the winning team. pic.twitter.com/sV2of1r8sP
Not really?? The main wave of the fandom are toxic YES but at the end of the day no matter who they are they pushed BTS to their current position. We shouldn't thank or be grateful to 2nd gen for things such as the UN speech when ARMY & BTS got that on their own
Asia, arguably yes. WW ? No lmao. Give me numbers, give me sales, give me concert attendance outside of asia and then compare that to what bts has achieved the past year alone. Then comeback here. Give me a UN speech too if you can find one.
Also since the ARMY fandom is huge their achievements are more known since there are more of them who voted for much higher-held awards (I.e Billboard or even the UN speech). BTS did also benefit from the fact they connected more w their younger audience mentally
Kim Nam-joon's speech at the UN was heartfelt. I have to give credit to celebrities that use their massive platform for good. Especially in shouting out LGBTQ+ youth, who I'm sure many listen to @bts_bighit. #mvp #allyoftheyear https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
Update: BTS will be awarded with the order of cultural merit medal as the youngest recipents ever. This is also due to their iconic UN speech and contributions, sold-out tour, and having a lot of "firsts" in the history of KPOP. https://m.news.naver.com/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=103&oid=449&aid=0000159763 …https://twitter.com/bangtanpopcrave/status/1027542140102967296 …
@abcWNN Please acknowledgement the wrong doing here. @kendisgibson really needs to apologize for this extremely insensitive, sarcastic, derisive, commentary against UNICEF Global Ambassadors, BTS on the occasional their historic speech at the UN . https://youtu.be/rNWLxQVBejo
I don't know. I was also crazy busy at work. Found BTS via AMAs. Do you communicate with her via text or FB messenger or whatsapp, Viber, Line? Drop her a song and RM's UN speech. Then tell her the next time you see her (weekend) , you'll ask for her opinion
one from the washington post that covers bts’ un speech!
Thank youuu the livestream i was watching didn’t do it justice so i didn’t quite grasp that V was referring to RM & quoting him from his UN speech~ [] #BTS  #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt http://pca.eonline.com
GUYS SO I SHARED A CLIP OF BTS HAVING THEIR SPEECH IN UN AND MY BOSS SHARED AND TODAY HE TOLD ME THAT WHO IS THAT KOREAN GUY SPEAKING AND HE WAS REALLY AMAZED AND HE SAID RM WAS SO HANDSOME AND SMART. YALL MY BOSS IS AN ASEAN ASSESOR. HE WAS AMAZED BY OUR INTELLECTUAL LEADER.
Those are same guys presenting their empowering UN speech in front of World Bank President, SK First Lady, UN Secretary-General and other high-class representatives #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/kimlelel/status/1048967792131809281 …
This part of the other night in Citifield really got me... you can tell how much Namjoon’s UN speech really touched and resonated with them. Tae is so sweet... @BTS_twt #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS pic.twitter.com/mGeIchF9gP
I think the people who are into music and a bit older are the ones who keep a more open mind about the boys. I work with a guy who is in his late forties and also an artist/musician and he was so impressed when I showed him Joon’s UN speech.
never would I have guessed almost a year later I’d go to a BTS concert with my parents and have my dad walk out and go “that’s the best concert I’ve ever been to” and hear my mom say how namjoon’s UN speech almost made her cry
and since u think those are armys being toxic cause they are searching for bts and didn't like that groups music here..this one was spreading false shxt under popcr(a)ve's tweet of un speech... speaking of toxic https://twitter.com/Nataliekpopkpop/status/1044380546808393729?s=20 …
Hi guys, I feel bad for the treatment you received trying to play a cover song. Keep moving forward. RM said in his UN speech find your voice, Speak Yourself. Meaning you have control of your life just need to Speak Yourself I will definitely hear your cover & EP
So today I was scrolling through my twitter and one of my classmate was peeking on me and I told him about @BTS_twt and their influences and also about RM giving speech at UN..He immediately went..Oh!I have watched that speech..It was so great and moving! (1/2)
two things I'm extremely proud of: bts' speech at the un general assembly and taylor speaking up about political issues
So has this past month possibly been the most impactful one of BTS' whole career? Sold out US tour w/ press coverage including 1st stadium, UN speech, AGT, Fallon, GMA, Grammy interview, did I forget anything?
Look at this baby geeking out about his UN speech #RM #KimNamJoon #BTS #BTSLoveYourselfTour #BTSWorldTour #BTSLYTour #BTSxCitifield #BTSMakesHistory @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KmWPJczQ6x
Other journalists mentioned it after the UN speech but for somebody so young he has gravitas. You can’t teach that. You either have it or you don’t. It’s always been there. It comes out at his end of concert speeches. You just want to listen & learn.
so i let my family watch rm's UN speech to educate them that bts is not just handsome looking men and the first thing my dad said was "he looks like a president" he IS OUR PRESIDENT @BTS_twt
and you guys i have basically a shrine of bts posters in my dorm and she’s teaching herself the members and her biases are Yoongi and JK and she watched the UN speech and she said she loves what they stand for and even if she doesn’t understand rn she’s willing to learn
And while kai was sitting on that gucci show V with bts were giving a speech at the UN Do you think bts wouldn't get invited just like kai it's more they didn't attend bc they have no time Like i said the same day bts was at the UN who would think a Gucci show is better than that
Not to mention BTS also made a speech at the UN and their music has saved millions of lives and there are part of a campaign cuz love myself which has received over $5 million in less than a year if you call these low standards then you're the one but doesn't understand here
my fav bts song is their UN speech
Everyone changed their opinions to BTS when namjoon did a speech at UN and a first korean boyband to perform at the citified
i told my mom about the citified show and un speech and how bts are making history and had a really great talk about their message and their whole story and mom said she really likes them and has never seen artists like them
I m an Indian and I love BTS . BTS has made their country proud and this is how they are treating them. This is shameless. Why you people are like this.. Have you not listened the RM UN speech.. Being an Indian I was watching it live and felt proud.
Doing my english homework. Task: talk 5 minutes long about a topic of your choice in front of everyone. Guess, what did this shy girl pick? Exactly. @BTS_twt RMs UN speech. (I don’t like my english so feel free to correct/help me if you would like to) pic.twitter.com/B5sUChIGOT
I’m in Model UN at my school and we have a trip to the UN building in New York and I just realized @BTS_twt was just there and I’m lowkey freaking out because I’m going to talk to some people that were there and heard their beautiful speech omg #BTSxUnitedNations
Have you watched @BTS_twt's UN speech? It contains great life lessons for girls (e.g., grit/resilience, dealing with mistakes/failure, self-compassion, assertiveness). My daughter & I (both #BTS fans) watched it together & had a great discussion afterward https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
Namjoon’s the one talking to RJ actually. You see him wearing the suit he wore at UN? That’s the whole point of the video. RM is telling RJ to love himself for who he is, not who people wants him to be, similar to his UN speech. Jin later walks up to them and overhears it
When I say I love BTS, I mean it. Not only is their music inspirational and empowering, but so are they as people. The messages they spread, the UN speech, the Love Yourself UNICEF Campaign, everything they do is amazing and they are so inspirational and motivational +
he also learned from his mistakes & has apologized for everything he’s done. he also believes that mistakes make us who we are, learning from them & educating ourselves is an important quality. bts didn’t give a speech at the UN & continue to succeed for nothing. stop hating.
@BTS_twt @bts_bighit @BTS_National My sincere apologies @NewHopeClub The entire world listened to #RM speech at #UN Where were u?Inspiring striking positive remarks, mistakes in the past as a human pouring his humble heart. #BTSARMYstand by #BTS FOREVER https://twitter.com/unicef/status/1044357197600305156 …
When RM came out in his glasses, I burst into tears. I admit it. I love this look on him and I got to see it first hand again. But I thought about the UN speech. And how BTS makes me feel happy about myself & my life. So I That’s really where my happy tears came from -adminT pic.twitter.com/DxpUD6IMVE
still in awe everytime my classmates talk about bts amd their achievements specially namjoons un speech they call em rapmon, jin, suga, jhope, jimin, v and jungkook
BTS UN speech might also help too since it seems like you severely lack of brain cells that it’s dangerous. Here https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y
He appeared on the screen and I lost it. He referred back to the UN Speech and told us to Speak Ourselves and out stories. I lost it even more. Guys I really love Kim Namjoon. I love everything and everyone in @BTS_twt in general. Best night of my life pic.twitter.com/UAXlN2qZKM
My mom is a new army about 2 wks ago? She was amazed to BTS at Burn The Stage and RM's speech at UN. Before she neither supports nor against me since I can buy merchs from my own. Now im happy that we can fangirling together and she understand now why i love this boys so much.
Reporter) NY city even added trains for this day and fans were waiting for the concert in tents.

They called BTS sexist racist and homophobic I mean the UN speech is right fcking here

Nobody harras fox news every comment sent was calling him out Nobody ask him to worship bts but being disrespectful man had to much pride to say why they were at un speech to downplay them Ask him or his friend what's the point of this pic.twitter.com/XY0Ge4CMPT
Last night Kim Namjoon, in a few minutes, brought me to tears more than his UN speech. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/6Y1Jws9kxo
Then: "they wouldn't make it" "they can't sing" "no one wants to attend their free concert" Now: "went to bbmas" "went to the Grammy museum" "went to the UN and had their speech there" "performed in citifield in front of 50k army's" @BTS_twt @bts_bighit
i mean how hard it is just search bts on google the un speech will literally be amongst the top results
i translated namjoon's speech at the UN and my grandma, who cutely calls BTS my 'seven bodyguards' whenever she sees my laptop screensaver, was so touched by his words... she often complains abt youth and how we seem so lost sometimes and she said they were setting a good

My uncle whose not into K-pop asks me about #Namjoon speech in UN. He wonders if Namjoon wrote it himself so he could speak it fluently.

We're so surprised.... you can talk about education and manner Before such speech, please stop slurp splash during eating..... Please !
BTS Speech @UN. “Yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes.” “I have come to love myself for who I am, for who I was, and for who I hope to become.” #BTS_twt #nowanarmy

my step mom told me about how she saw bts giving a speech at the UN and was praising them for using their huge platform to promote goodness :( they’re truly remarkable. i love<3
It's the exact feeling that I felt when they made a speech @UN. This feeling of pride. I am crying again because of too much happiness for our boys. #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt
If you send un speech's words i can do
With every thing BTS does, we all get even more proud. Not even starting with UN Speech, but CITI FIELD!!! 60K PEOPLE!!!! This is not small people. This is what legends do. I think it's already obvious, that BTS is going to stay forever- they are going to be remembered forever
OMG CAN YOU DO ONE WITH HIS UN SPEECH PLEASE ?
The difference is what BTS represents and what they do with their music and their talent after all no other group has done something like they did with their love myself campaign with UNICEF also BTS actually was able to make a speech at the UN BTS came from a small company
And then my mom was like “she wants to marry one of them” bc I told her I wanted to Marry Namjoon after the FW concert and then she started telling my grandma about how Joonie gave a great speech at the UN and talked about his humble beginnings, I love my mom supporting BTS lol pic.twitter.com/QCbx3CKxuI
You know what?! Any marketing is good marketing in N.A. so let's not worry. You haven't made it till you got haters so w/e. BTS is gonna continue to do what they do. RM's speech at UN was example of what he can accomplish in a lang. he's not even fluent in so :)
Before we collective cry later during the Citi Field concert, I'm gonna spam the tl with nostalgia that is @BTS_twt's UN speech
OH BY THE WAY I WROTE A CLASS NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ABOUT BTS AND THEIR COME UP AND THEIR HARDSHIPS AND JOON'S SPEECH AT THE UN. IM DOING THIS FOR A CLASS FULL OF RACIST ASS MOTHERFUCKERS.
My family so savage. they are being mean about me liking BTS I’m trying to show them the UN speech and tell them about the campaign and they just look at me like wtf is she talking about. I’m 25 and proud to love @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/v4olBbiuKB
BTS loves animals and I like BTS too. As BTS said "speak out yourself" in the UN speech, I hope someday BTS will "speak out" about Korean dog meat. The BTS army should help them to do this. #BTSpeakOut #RMSugaVJHopeJinJiminJungkukSpeakOutpic.twitter.com/IG2642IJ0y
Awwww cutie tell your mom what they meant to you. I got campus placement when I used a part namjoon’s UN speech for my interview. That’s how important BTS is for me, My parents know
@BTS_twt a famous boygroup, 7 young men from South Korea, quote of their speechwhatever your gender identity, your skin color, speak yourselfthey donated 3% their trilogy album, love yourself series to support @UNICEF campaignpic.twitter.com/9WPfHgU949
I had dinner with some of my friends tonight. I knew they're into kpop stuffs(they're multis actually), so I tried to get them into BTS by introducing some songs, talking about the UN speech. Then all of them said they heard about the boys' speech and it was great, BUT +++
Kim Namjoon of @BTS_twt was only 24 when he was able to make a speech in front of the UN and was able to change millions of life's

Good morning! Today is already a great day!! We were talking about how the UN speech could help BTS break free of some stereotypes a few days ago, and I'm happy to share this with you! A well-respected french newspaper wrote a great article. Finally! https://twitter.com/KavkaNana/status/1048512707643760640?s=19 …
OMG NSIQBSUW THE RADIO IM LISTENING TO IS TALKING ABOUT BTS AFTER PLAYING AIRPLANE PT2. ESPECIALLY JOON’S SPEECH IN UN. IM SO HAPPYY UWUU SKSKKSKS #BTS⁠ ⁠ #IDOL #TheMusicVideo #PCAs
YES ! In le Monde, we trust ! They don’t enumerate cringy adjectives to describe their physicality nor the stereotypes and clichés linked to KPOP industry. The heart and accent is put on BTS, their achievements and Namjoon’s speech at UN like how it should be !
What if bts might drop a song with a lyrics of some part of rm's speech in UN cause why not bts always giving us a clue but we realise it too late
Rapmonster is a racist, which is probably why so many people in the trash-dump @BTS_twt fandom are racist and anti-Black, and he needs to be called out for it and the world needs to know. The real question is, why would @UNICEF allow a colorist, racist to give a UN speech ?
Kpop fandoms down play bts awards as charity awards and accuse them of paying for the awards, called bts recent speech at the UN mediaplay, called them westernized and said they sold out their souls to be accepted in America, this is just karma , there is no lane
If you are a new Army, watch this and then go rewatch @BTS_twt UN speech. Never give up on what may seem impossible #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS https://twitter.com/RMPICS_twt/status/1048481191203151872 …
Anywys, i wanted to say that you did a very great job at the UN It must ve been a whole new experience I saw the papers were already wrinkled you mustve rehearsed the speech soo many times aaahhhh i am proud that you delivered it well
Had a dinner with my parents just now and my mom were talking about bts’s speech at UN she impressed with namjoon’s speech I’m..... I’m a proud fan :’)
Okay I luv that @Hmartuk just tweed about the @BTS_twt UN Speech even the korean supermarket at K-Town (K-Road as many call it) in New Malden saw its importance :))) - they should defo come to try the 치맥 & K-BBQ in New Malden ! #NewMalden #Surey #KoreaTownLondon ~https://twitter.com/Hmartuk/status/1044599382518231040 …

My friend after UN speech! #AMAs #AMAs BTS #TheMusicVideo @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/3JO6iQx9UB
I am not hurrying to tag Bighit producer as a “homophobic” person. However, what he said is not very appropriate, considering BTS promotes self-love and RM included gender identity in his UN speech
compilation of interviews they had was great ,didnt make armys sound crazy, they included NJs un speech too.The translation to bangtan tho
About how BTS is great because they're nice boys and that they're making such a big difference in the world and that she was really proud of them. She's from Korea and she talked to us about how BigHit beat the big 3, the UN Speech, and that when she first saw them debut that she
And of course, 12 days ago I saw Namjoon give his absolutely beautiful speech at the UN about his story and loving, accepting, and speaking yourself with BTS by his side. The words made me believe even more in myself and it helped make my voice even stronger.
When I heard the speech I just cried, when he said “what’s your name? What makes your heart beat?” I realized I don’t know, I don’t know who I am and what is my place in this world, I don’t know what makes my heart beat, but know I know I have to find myself. @BTS_twt thank you.
um @BTS_twt can y’all let namjoon perform his UN speech at #BTSCITIFIELD please
she hates the un so i tried to say bts was invited to make a speech as they are paired with unicef but then my dad was like “WE GOING NOW” so i didn’t get to praise the boys :(
His speech always leaves me emotional everytime I watch it, and it's like it's the first time I've seen it. @BTS_twt
You thought you weren't going to make it, right? Look at you now, guys. You were invited to lot of American shows, you gave an important speech at the UN youth strategy conference. You literally sold out the whole tour. Tomorrow you will give your first US stadium concert.
Sorry your notification might be blowing up but BTS are very humble band and make their own music. They started from bottom unlike other kpop group who are pushed by their rich company. You can check their UN speech by BTS and other tracks with lyrics. their lyrics are meaningful
citifield, un speech, grammy interview. still the biggest achievements of bts. idk if theres any groups can top that. they need a fandom like army and a passion for music like bts in order to achieve that which i think theyll /never/ get.
That's the BTS reach!! I still watch the UN speech everyday.
It's hilarious I regularly have to wonder if he would rather discuss BTS over the English lesson. He's had his students watch Namjoon's UN speech and regularly gets sidetracked for five or ten minutes just talking about BTS. Not to mention attempting to dance during class
K media reported the board messages between teache and students at Fernwood Middle School, New Jersey. The teacher, Costello shared @BTS_twt RM’s UN speech on their regular #wordsofawesome board and the students also wrote words of RM speech and the lyrics http://naver.me/G2SVgqfn pic.twitter.com/yzpaOOrdMU
my aunt who has absolutely no idea that i like bangtan shared a link of RM's UN speech on her facebook. i had to browse up to check if what i saw was real or not and yes it was. she shared the message, im proud, today is a good day! @BTS_twt
bts, the one who runs the world, the one who nicki minaj working with them, opened up a new universe of music and is insanely talented inviting him to UN speech, grammys interviews, amas, bbmas, jimmy fallon, jimmy kimmel, james corden, ellenx2, yeah that one
He has to be fired. He is racist n has xenophobia inspite of he is colored races. Youtuber superwoman also gives a speech in UN but he insulted the reason why bts is not american. We have to protest officially to abc. Lets Go 'world news now' .
I watch Joon's UN speech every day and every day every time he says "and sometimes I just wanted to quit" and gives a little smile, my heart breaks into a million pieces. @BTS_twt Joon I love you so much. Thank you for not giving up. Thank you for being my inspiration 보라해

Shout out to @kendisgibson for his narrow outlook on bts' accomplishments. thanks for trying your hardest to detract from the meaningful message behind their UN speech and their entire discography. maybe next time, avoid reporting on things you know absolutely nothing about.
Watching Rookie King and AHL, I just wanna go back in time and hug the boys tightly and tell them that everything will be alright, that they’ll be the biggest kpop group and boy band in the world, and tell them about sold out concerts, the UN speech etc. Emotional @BTS_twt
my friend just remarked about @BTS_twt UN speech and i was like yeah it’s been what they’ve always stood for and message they wanted to spread and he was like yeah right i bet their manager told them that and i just felt so hurt that i couldn’t even argue back...stereotypes hurt
Sometimes I find myself streaming RM's UN speech @BTS_twt #PCAs #TheSong #IDOL

The speech moved me greatly. Listening to the other speakers made me feel motivated and engaged too. If it hadn't been for BTS, I wouldn't have tuned in – but I'm so happy that I did! I've already donated to #ENDviolence, and I'm looking forward to seeing #GenUnlimited grow
Tbh after the principal mentioned the @BTS_twt UN speech, all my frustrations melted away! I usually stay unbothered because I don’t think myself as too old lol but I was just caught off guard that day! It turned out so much better though!
I mean not as often as me. so this is made my day!! and im still finding the way how to get her to become an army. coz she is not. i try every ways. MV, songs, variety till the UN Speech, byt nothing happen. Huhuhu #PCAs #TheGroup @BTS_twt #bts
All my lyft drivers asked me that too but they didn't know who BTS was. THIS WAS BEFORE THEIR UN SPEECH

Lmao as if burj khalifa is more important than giving a speech in the UN. Bts doesn't need to prove anything to you since they are already out of your fave's league
To @ABC and @abcnews I am writing to ask that @kendisgibson issue an apology for his rude and disrespectful comments regarding BTS during a segment about RM’s speech at the UN.
DAMMIT @BigHitEnt @bts_bighit LET TAE AND JIMIN RELEASE THE GADDAMN DUET SO WHAT IF THEY'RE 2 MEN ITS 2018 NAMJOON DID A SPEECH IN THE UN FFS HIS MESSAGE WAS NO MATTER WHO OR WHAT YOU ARE SPEAK YOURSELF LET TAE AND JIMIN SPEAK
Videos on YouTube like joon’s speech at the UN and the idol challenge. It took me a long time (about a year). I’m proud of myself it feels like I’m finally getting through to her. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/xt6FBehn6y
But he still fucked up america.. also u didnt see the un speech where he was laughed at from WORLD LEADERSS
Anyone else watched namjoons speech from the UN unexpectedly throughout the day because it gives you confidence and hope to live for.. :,) @BTS_twt @bts_love_myself @UNICEF
On the ongoing saga of my colleague who likes ddaeng, and heard RM's UN speech: He said this morning that he loves Suga's "energy" in Ddaeng. So I sent him a few solos - First Love, Seesaw, So Far Away, The Last - and he's now left speechless. That's my bias, guys. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/TkFGboKCFN
Tae has like such a tight schedule and still does a song (a beautiful one at that) and BigHit be like: Nah that's "gay" we're not having that... (basically a fuck you to Namjoons UN speech and everything BTS stands for) I wonder how many duets weren't "straight" enough as well
in our class earlier, our prof told us to choose a youth leader and print it on a paper explaining what is the impact and things that the leader had done. i chose namjoon and his UN speech #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt
Hi mily. Don't worry, you're not going to be a part of internet violence here, but since you put your words on the internet and @b/ts, here's what army thinks. Bts was not there at the UN to just give a speech b'coz they have a huge fanbase, they were there cuz they had
Today during social studies lesson, my teacher used BTS as an example of how celebrities are able to influence people. She showed my class the UN speech and i kinda fangirled and kept laughing Im so proud of them
You're just a loser. The reason why BTS saying love yourself. They speech at the UN because of the people like you. Live a life man. Good luck.
Honestly i think graham will either show an embarrassing video from BTS's past, or maybe show a clip of the UN speech? With the performers it's a shorter chat than it is with the other guests so idk
Astagfirullah, Namjoon ki UN wali speech yaad karo kiya bola tha usne And....It was about no violence I'M LAUGHING HARD
A boy that gave speech in UN im so proud
Yeah right this is the same guy who made a 7 mins speech at the UN HEADQUARTERS. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/iAZ35LM1Ev
if you clicked on the link you can see the @BTS_twt UN speech, education on LGBTQIA+, and more. I also plan on adding as much as I can. I asked her to show this to our class bc we have a lot more students than any other English class does and her audience is pretty huge.
If it's okay actors to made a speech in the UN, why can't BTS? The answer to that is simply bcs BTS is kpop. No we're not ashamed of BTS being kpop. Even Yoongi said he already accepted that he's an idol so who is army to take that label of BTS?
BTS are more than just good looking boys, dancing and singing in fancy clothes. But some media did not see that. Some even think BTS is huge bcs the fandom are made of teens and BTS are merely hearthrob. They even question why BTS made a speech in the UN
We taught the primary school kids today.. and our topic was ‘love’. We’ve shown them Namjoon’s UN speech. E-education #BTS #BTSArmy  #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/21pd0ZF9Zx
I showed my dad Namjoons speech he gave at the UN and showed him some of their lyrics and he said he gained a lot of respect for BTS and I've never been more proud.
And 2018 wasn’t BTS’s peak! Just wait till you see what 2019 holds, after the UN speech, Fallon and GMA .. you should be prepared to what’s gonna happen next, already got chills just thinking about it! I vote @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠
Just the facts sis... And don't you love the fact that in Airplane pt.2 Joon says, "who should I live today, Kim Namjoon or RM" and on his UN speech he said, "I am Kim Namjoon and also RM from BTS... I LooOoVE soft hours [open]
BTS's speech at the UNGA is NOT "another record", I don't think they'll suddenly start calling kpop groups to every UNGA. BTS did this because they always had the intention of doing something philanthropic & so they partnered with UN END VIOLENCE campaign last yr, leading to this https://twitter.com/KBSWorldTV/status/1047819013256970240 …

I showed both my parents Namjoons UN speech and they were both completely blown away by it. Part one out of who knows how many on getting my parents to appreciate BTS as much as I do is complete.

Hey #BTSxARMY read the bottom paragraph! The kids know IBTS ( #BT21 is all over my door!) & weren't surprised when I played the UN speech. Would & appreciate if you spread the word & helped add books to my class library! https://donorschoo.se/e/VeqcFW8WDQ #SpeakYourself IS my classroom
I showed my dad the UN speech RM made and he said it what’s eally nice and they are really articulate and I should marry one of them It’s official, my dad ships me with BTS
I'm tired of reading tweets like this about ARMY. And why does nobody flinch when people drag or insult BTS?? Where were you when antis mocked us for getting a month for preorders? Or when they mocked RM's speech at the UN? Or when they mocked idol? Just say you're an anti and go
Ughh fix it with KIM NAMJOON @BTS_twt 148 IQ, 24 years old but still delivered the most powerful & deep speech while the 73° GA @UN A real postive role model for the current & next generations !
Indonesia...FYI people in My country are stereotypical about masculinity of men that said men shouldn't wear make up,didn't believe about men can have flawless skin and can't accept another country beauty standard,but after saw UN speech in news channel they really amaze of BTS

This is very sad but when are you going to apologize for your rude and disrespectful comments regarding BTS during a segment about RM’s speech at the UN? Surely you have had enough time to reflect on your behaviour by now. Kindly issue a sincere apology promptly
For me, I want one wrist to have the LY:A album design on one wrist, and the other for Her's design. If I could, Id tattoo all of Joonie's UN speech on there as well. But underneath Her, it will say Love Yourself, and Answer will say Speak Yourself.
Hey @BTS_twt @BigHitEnt y’all better put Namjoon’s UN speech in the next album or we unstan. Ok? Ok.
Oh wait I forgot to mention that the Olympics reached out to bts first but since they were so booked they had to refuse and that’s why ur faves performed. And uh, 2x recognition from the President, UN speech (where said president gifted them a personalized watch)
Imagine hearing Joon's UN speech & still deciding to disregard EVERYTHING BTS stand for & whitewash not only them but also people of color they interact with. I am sick and tired of this fucked up mentality.
Furthermore, I think @kendisgibson should give a UNICEF speech before the UN in flawless Korean, since RM's English wasn't good enough for dear Kendis. Stop thinking you're so much better than everyone. @abcWNN #BTS #IDOL #BTSARMY #KendisGibsonIsOverParty
rom their homeground. BTS ain't having none of it (IDOL, Namjoon's UN Speech), so why can't you join them in their brave and unapologetic endeavor?
More beautiful than this sunset was @BTS_twt RM's UN speech. But you trash mouthed them. Shame on you ! Apologise !
Huh! As if BH will really pay them for a speech?! Like Whut?! Come on! Common sense please why would BH bother to pay UN for a speech when BTS have a full packed schedule don't have time to rest. Why would they pay UN where they're are already very popular GLOBALLY. YES GLOBALLY! https://twitter.com/tinyseokjinnie/status/1047779462291513345 …
SO MY DAD GOT CURIOUS ABOUT BTS SO I SHOWED HIM THE IDOL MV + NAMJOONS UN SPEECH AND TOLD HIM A LOT ABOUT EM AND HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN ARMY NOW O MY GODDDD he thinks theyre rly cool and talented, he LOVED rm’s speech, he likes the music hE WANTS TO GO TO A CONCERT
So i made tis by using RM's precious wrds ,inspired by his UN speech becoz tis is smthn i can't keep jst to myslf, nd i am gonna pin it up on my college's noticebord or smwhere in my college, where evryone can see this so people can get inspiration @BTS_twt #kimnamjoon #BTS pic.twitter.com/8GGmaJ5qZr
ppl really out their whitewashing a black kid even after bts speech at the un clearly stated “no matter who you are, where you’re from, your SKIN COLOUR, your gender identity, just speak yourself.” do some ppl even think a sec before tweeting or drawing such stuff.
They're @BTS_twt, seven talented Korean artists and UNICEF Ambassadors. Their leader RM, gave a speech at the UN for @_GenUnlimited. No one is too old for BTS, their socially aware music can relate to anyone of any age. pic.twitter.com/yKi2SMNwk9

This is fucking disgusting,,, how many times does this fandom have to throw in black army’s faces and bts’ that they hate our skin ???? there’s something called the UN speech that tells them to FUCK RIGHT OFF what’s so hard about that https://twitter.com/THICJ00N/status/1047883516640415745 …
Did Namjoon's UN speech mean nothing to y'all? He didn't include people of all races just for y'all to whitewash a black child. Sometimes I really wonder if BTS's message even means anything if this is how y'all are gonna behave.
i just included part of namjoons UN speech in my journal sharing thing in ap lit class and spoke it and i lost my breath but im so happy to include bts in these smol things in life and overcome my fear of lik ppl judging and shit bc everyones close minded and borderline racist
So we were in class learning about the UN and human rights and the teacher was showing us the best speeches spoken a the UN and she showed us BTS’s speech and like i was dying in the back literally
My parents watched the UN general assembly speech and my mom goes he's so well mannered . She's RM baised now . My potato ass sister couldn't record a proper video . @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/8RRCs6prTn
well, my friend watched RM's UN speech and she said that they did pretty well, and with @BTS_twt 's huge fanbase, it's such a good thing that they're using it to bring about change. oh, and this is the very same friend who's kinda tired of hearing' 'kpop music' from me.
Me too... haha, I wear prescription glasses and working in front of computer all the time. Sometimes, my eyes can't compromise anymore when the clock showing 10/11PM. Just imagine when we have to stream Namjoon speech at UN...it's 1/2AM in Indonesia.

That RM is now a world star, but Sleepy said not the cause. Just a big hand in it. Sleepy also said BTS only has a group SNS account and not individual. Host asked if he saw the UN speech & Sleep said he got goosebumps from it. He said "I got his number...now he has gone to UN"+
remember when we thought the bts grammy interview is the biggest thing yet that happen to bts and then a whole UN speech happened, whew i need to breathe @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs

bts ARE a kpop group but we don't want them to labelled "just a Korean boy band" because that keeps them from being taken seriously as we have seen some of the shit that was said even after their UN speech
I’m so mad that this guy Kendis Gibson humiliate BTS on Abc News while commenting on their speech in the UN. Can you do your job properly? The fuck
I was in an Uber last night after the BTS concert, and the guy driving knew all about @BTS_twt charity work and the UN speech because some girl was talking about them the day before. I’m WHEEZING! ARMY out here telling random people about BTS at any moment.
Srsly, people who actually say that BTS paid to give their speech are jobless and stupid AF!!! If you could pay to go to the UN then y’all might’ve gone there to say those shit by now.

A convo w/ 1 of our Korean parents in the Nursery: P: Do you like BTS???? Me: UHHHH YES! P: Ahhh! Who is your favourite?? (She meant bias i guess) Me: Jin and taehyung..all of them P: Have you watched the speech of their leader in UN? Me: yes!! Namjoon! It was awesome.
the things k-media spreading bout BTS and UN is just laughable. LMAO did you really think anyone could just go to the UN assembly and make a speech in front of millions of people the in UN'S MAIN BROADCAST CHANNEL? dear God, who's the idiot made them wrote this?

people coming with "bts too" if you didn't know, bts has not only apologised but they've made it evident that they support equality from their actions and their UN speech whereas many of your faves have repeatedly done problematic things https://twitter.com/killmongvrls/status/883844540817301504 …

I told her about bts, and she goes ‘oh the guy that did the UN speech right???’ like yes queen we love an educated friend who supports their friends wow
I did same for a current event on the UN Speech day I got 5/5 hahahahaha
Knetz again and again Yall think BTS paid UN for the speech? Yall think UN and Unicef tu apa? YALL Yang Bog3 mediaplay tak cakap apa pulak kan Tang BTS “mediaplay”. Bullshit.
They accused bh of paying UN to allow bts to make a speech eye HAVE to laugh
GUYS PLEASE HELP ME TO HAVE A TOPIC FOR OUR SPEECH BUT I NEED SOME BTS INSPIRATION (ex: NAMJOON’s UN SPEECH) PLEASE HELP MEEEEE
I mean did they not hear Joon's speech at the UN? If they were going to unstan they should have already by now. And let's be very clear about one thing - BTS will always have us. ARMY isn't that fickle.
People go as far as claiming bts paid UN to give a speech. HOW FCKING LOW
@kendisgibson You must really hate your life to mess with BTS and ARMY don't you ? You're either very brave or very stupid to be mock BTS, someone who did a speech at UN. Something you won't have the ability to, so run along cause no one needs you
I've seen a lot of disgusting bs from a lot of those types of people. I read someone say joon's un speech and BTS philanthropic work is just "media play" jfc.
People success when others say negative things. It's like some ppl really think bts don't deserve anything. This UN speech is really a positive thing yet ppl really want to bash on them for it. I pity those ppl actually. https://twitter.com/tinyseokjinnie/status/1047779462291513345 …
So while my mom was driving me to school i started telling her about bts inspiring a lot of people, about bts' speech at the UN, and my mom told me (in our language which is Filipino) "Really? If that's the case, then I like them now. If they inspire you then I support you now"
Also they pointed out that "Place where BTS gave speech is not where President Moon gave speech but UN General Assembly proceeds at multiple places so argument that it's not where UN General Assembly is held is wrong information"
1. UN conference and UNICEF ceremony much different? Knetz argued that "Place where BTS gave speech is not the actual UN Assembly is held", UNICEF Korean Committee answered that "BTS attended Unicef youth agenda 'Generation Unlimited' which is included in UN Assembly officially

5+ years isnt a fad lol, a fad also wouldnt be giving a speech at the UN as ambassadors. You guys can dislike BTS for whatever reason but dont diminish what they have done in the music world. Besides, all these artists are doing great so really no reason to go at eachother
8. It's ironic that they left left after that wonderful speech and presentation and many of those diplomats including those at the UN now have to leave by the end of the year due to their sexual orientation. @BTS_twt are working on being different as far as social stances and +
The more they keep giving to army.. And we as army cant help become more proud.. Their mindset.. Remember RM's speech in UN... Damn.. Thats just.. I know i stan the right group..
But I'm glad that my family don't make fun of them.. My mom actually likes BTS a lot and often tells me that they are too beautiful for this world and my dad just became joon biased bcz of UN speech
Please don't let insecure people deliver your news. They smell of bigotry. I love ABC but you have to cut off @kendisgibson.

I dare I DARE bts to come out with a digital only live world tour concert album with the UN speech as a bonus track imagine how many people would get that just to relive their favorite moments during the concert

Seriously, whenever I feel down,the first thing I do is pray,then watch Namjoon's speech @the UN. At work when some people show they are in power to question your capability, I think about the words LOVE YOURSELF&SPEAK YOURSELF. I really speak myself. Its about time. @BTS_twt
hello @BTS_twt . My lecturer played your un speech for our literature class just now and only god knows how much i tried to restrain myself from violently fangirling at the moment
Can't stop thinking about btspopers using "idol" as an insult to separate BTS from their colleagues and then Kim Namjoon going and calling himself an idol during his speech at the UN. That's what I call poetic justice and one of the many reasons I love that man with all my heart.
Second, I cannot hold back my tears everytime I listen to your speech at UN! It was so impactful, motivating and so real!!! Your words still shake my core! Did I say already how proud I am??? Thank you for everything Kim Namjoon
Well there is this news reporter who mocked BTS on national TV about the UN speech and then this UK radio station host talked mess about BTS and saying their music is trash just because BTS couldn't make it to their show?? I'm tired
BTS is the ambassador of UNICEF, they have a campaign against violence. 3% of their profit goes to UNICEF & they raised over millions of dollars already. The theme / topic in the UN at that time was about “YOUTH” which is related to BTS’ campaign. UNICEF invited BTS for speech
namjoon is so wise like his un speech deadass inspired my mom to write a poem and i'm not even joking #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #IDOL @BTS_twt
Next bts? First of all there's none other like bts.. Or big bag or exo. Everyone has their own unique ways and talent. Please stop comparing each other. Like kim namjoon speech in UN event, "find your own voice" pic.twitter.com/G9EDXZzkcK
@BTS_twt one day in the future un speech by namjoon will be historic. #BTS #PCAs #TheGroup
For him it’s “hilarious” cause he doesn’t want to hear advice about life from a boyband. But BTS are 7 guys, 7 human beings with opinions as any other. Using their influence to do good! working with @UNICEF He can always go listen to his president speech at UN. Even they laughed.
Their music resonates with a wide demographic because they talk about socially aware topics like mental health, self love, empowerment, dreams, etc. An example of this message was seen at their UN speech. pic.twitter.com/yKi2SMNwk9
put down and undermine literally everything that BTS has done. putting down their music, their achievements, artistry, their UN speech and even how they talk about mental health, something which is important to so many people. don't fuckin expect us to do something when you're-

Ikr!!! I always said this since i knew them. And then the UN invited them, I felt so amazed and proud that they are not just ARMY's hope, they are becoming the new generation's hope with Joon's speech. We really stan the right group

Hi baby, armys from the future in 2018 iam here to tell you that you had an interview at Grammy museum, a speech at the UN for UNICEFF. Also a sold out worldwide tour and your about to perform in a stadium with 50k people
Btw last Monday they gave a speech in UN General Assembly for a youth program called Generation Unlimited. I urge u to listen to what RM, the leader of the group, has to say. He wrote the speech himself. Very inspiring and motivating. #SpeakYourselfhttps://youtu.be/XXCqBotaGRI
Hey iam Army from the future and you guys have a sold out global tour in 2018 and are about to perform infront of 50k people at citified. You guys had a whole speech at the UN. I am so proud. I love u.

so i was talking to my tutor today about bts and she asked if they were the ones at the un and was like “one of them gave a speech” and i was like yeah and she was like “oh he was cute” like yes praise my mans namjoon he was damn cute
It’s so crazy to think even your hubby is a huge fan and loves jimin? Hehe he must have been proud of Rm’s UN speech

made the mistake of clicking on @people article abt an up & coming group that I kinda like, should've known better after that dumb poll they attached to the post abt BTS UN speech. The writer says they're "one of the most popular bands in K-Pop"...then went on to say pic.twitter.com/c6TZFvzNeb
Same to be honest, i don't even mention kpop or anything related to that, i just show them BTS and now the first thing i start with are their artistry and the UN speech. My colleagues at work loved Joons speech and msg so much that they started to look them up themselves
Listening to soundcloud and #RM ‘s UN speech came up unexpectedly yet I couldn’t bring myself to skip it so I listened to it and started tearing up at work. I haven’t even drawn all the members yet but this man is so inspiring I feel like drawing him for the third time. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/BgcuyX2rNH
my sister is writing an essay on bts in english and i have to help her bc she aint fluent and she's so nervous bc she cares about her teacher's opinion skjjsd & she included both the love myself campaign and joon's speech at un so i hope he'll understand they ain't jst a boy band

I was done with that people account when they tweeted that pole about which group you liked better after Joons UN speech. I’m like how is that an appropriate response to a heartfelt speech.
Perhaps your parents expect more than they saw from a kpop band who was elected to deliver speech at the UN. Its understandable. My parents probably said the same thing if I were to show them the speech. @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist on #Amas
I agree, thats why Joon's speech at UN were attracting young people more than adults. Adults prefer real solutions than questions. Young ppl related to it better bc they still looking for their "identity" and the best place among society.
if you’re ever need some inspiration, just remember that BTS’ message of protecting the youth when they debuted, ended up with them giving a speech at the UN. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS⁠ ⁠ @BTS_twt
I went to BTS UN Speech on Washington Post YT channel & spent half an hour in a car crying reading so many ARMY "speaking" their story about how BTS saves their life in the comment section. BTS is really out there saving lives with their music. #PCAs #BTS #TheGroup @BTS_twt
Aish, I simply cannot understand why BTS has not reached Danish tv yet. No news about them. High key thought there would be SOMETHING about the UN speech, but no. What more do they need to do to make it to fucking Danish news. They need to be talked about here!

@BTS_twt Did all of you work on the UN speech or was it just Namjoon?
Yall are stupid if you believe armys got time to spend to your faves. All those who started the shit are mostly multifandom. Theyre not belong to only army but yall only see us as the worst and say bts is unlucky for having us? Check namjoon’s speech at the UN last week.
@BTS_twt how do the rest of the members feel about the UN speech Namjoon gave?
Namjoon's speech UN "..I've made many and plenty mistakes in my life. I have many faults, and I have many more fears, but I'm gonna embrace myself as hard as I can, and I'm starting to love myself gradually just little by little.."
@ABC @ABCNetwork @abcnews should do something about @kendisgibson for broadcasting absurd remarks about BTS UN speech. Shame on him! Filipino Armys are angered. He should apologize!
Q: In the UN speech you mentioned, that at some point, you tried to fill other people's mold's. Do you think this applies to BTS? How?
RM was mentioned here in our English subject cuz our lesson is about speech, Persuasive Speech then our teacher mentioned about RM's speech @UN of BTS
I believe I've mentioned my request for a cd of all the tour ments to be included with the new album. With Joon's UN speech. All the interviews. If they speak it should be on the disc basically. I just like to hear their voices. I'm a mess.

It doesnt mean we as ARMYS should do it to them. BTS literally just gave a youth speech at the UN. we are now representatives of the new youth and we need to act like it by being more mature. Not dragging other groups or putting BTS in places they weren't mentioned in.
This lady straight up told me that “Kpop is funny” today when my volunteer coordinator asked if she knew who BTS were and so I hit her w the “BTS is really big. They even gave a speech at the UN last week” and that shut her up real fast bruh
Tbvh I feel bad for those lads. I don’t think it’s a smart move to go in right now, it would be much better to try when BTS is starting hiatus and some time has passed. Right this second everything is going to be compared to BTS and live up to the UN speech (imho)
I just linked my mom to the bts UN speech bc she likes ted talks
So @BTS_twt stun the world with a speech at the UN AND appearances on Fallon Tonight & GMA, then disappear for a bit, leaving the NY GP waiting with baited breath for their return. And it just had to be a record breaker at Citifield. Wow, that timing #PCAs #BTS #TheGroup

The thing is Mr Kendis Gidson, BTS have a speech at the UN Assembly whereas you....hmmm where do you stand in life and have you done anything of significance?
@abcWNN I'm shocked by the arrogant & judgemental remarks @kendisgibson made about the UN speech given by RM of #BTS Yet, how ironic that Kendis did 'speak' himself, revealing a hidden intolerance & superiority. You should find an anchor more inclusive of others & the world.
@btcostello05 4. Does the UN Speech of the BTS speech be used as a speech material? 5. As a teacher, how did you see the contents of the UN speech by the BTS? Then plese help me. I'll wait your reply.
@btcostello05 1. How did the BTS UN speech on the school whiteboard? 2. What was your class? 3. There were several phrases written on the board. Are the students who wrote this article different?
@btcostello05 Hello. I am a reporter for HankookIlbo(Korea Newspaper), Seung Joon Yang. I contacted you on the photo you uploaded on Twitter. the UN speech of the BTS. This is what I was wondering.
@kendisgibson hey, I just want you to know how childish you are and how ignorant your comments were regarding BTS and Namjoon's speech in UN. Just so you know this "boy band from Korea" has touched many people's hearts with their music and their message at the UN is extremely
Know your lane before doing stupid sh!t! Your faves aint a threat 1 bit to BTS! They already went to Grammy Museum and even has a speech in UN. EVEN WORLD LEADERS KNOW WHO BTS IS &you claim your faves a threat to them when they arent even relevant in Korea. Please. Just pathetic.
coworker who claims to hate bts bc her lil sis is annoying said she cried hearing namjoons un speech ugh his impact
my dad just watched five bts performances, an interview and the un speech wow his mind
@GoAwayWithJae What I was wondering is 1. What school does your son go to? (I wonder if he is in elementary, middle, or high school) 2. The UN Speech of the BTS is a hot topic.I think there will be repercussions among American parents.What moves were there?
@GoAwayWithJae Hello. I am a reporter for HankookIlbo(Korea Newspaper), Seung Joon Yang. I saw a good column('How BTS Are Breaking K-Pop’s Biggest Taboos') on Rolling Stone. I will contact you that you post on Twitter about RM UN speech.
OK never in my life have I thought of sending tweet to the UNITED NATIONS but two things happened .... @BTS gave a speech that moved this 61y grandmother to tweet about it.SOUTH KOREA must be very proud of the youth of their country.OK and Donald Trump got laughed at for lies !!

Everything BTS is achieving feels so surreal, last week they went to the UN to give a speech, then Fallon and GMA. And this week they have their first US stadium concert, I’m so proud of them. They indeed make their own records they don’t break them.
Of course I've sought mental health help, for us both, but I'd like to thank u for all that u do, following ur speech at the UN ur message to love yourself and talk yourself hit home to me, we're struggling with both, but ur music is inspirational to us so thank you for that
ashton kutcher shared the bts un speech on fb lol also pls idk why I have him liked on fb
Not gonna lie though. She wasn't wrong about us crying. I watched it live and it was such a beautiful speech I was in tears (all 6 of my family members were in tears). Not because I was fangirling that BTS was at the UN conference but because Namjoons words genuinely moved me.

The fact that every time RM gets asked how he felt giving the speech at UN and he said he was nervous and shaking blows my mind. He’s a performer that stands in front of thousands at a time and he was nervous about a speech. #BTS @BTS_twt
Just a week ago today, #BTS was at the UN & #RM was preparing to deliver this history-making &heartfelt speech for #GenerationUnlimited #ThankYouBTS here is link/ join us in watching again (Official Video) https://youtu.be/XXCqBotaGRI via @YouTube Trans by @agirlintheparkpic.twitter.com/IY97YIUYif
I read some comment in naver when bts give UN speech n majority the view is 30' male.Many comment is salty n bashing BTS give UN speech like "They need go to military soon","what they do?", "media play, iluminati, politics" n other bad comment. I just think, SK dont deserved them
22 BTS gave a speech at the UN on September 24th 2018. #PCAs #TheSong #IDOL @BTS_twt
I did emphasize their work with UNICEF as the main point and then sent a follow up once their UN speech was announced, but I’d have to actually work for UNICEF to apply through them
Winning millions of hearts by their powerful speech at UN. @BTS_twt is the not your mediocre boy band. But they are beyond musicality. #PCAs #TheSocialCelebrity #BTS
【RM moved my heart during his speech at the UN】 RT if he moved your heart like he did with mine. #PCAs #TheGroup #TheMusicVideo #TheSong #IDOL #AMAs #BTS @BTS_twt
"Isn't that speech made by that guy from BTS?" "Is that the speech from the UN?" "That's from RM, right?" THEIR MINDS pic.twitter.com/QgWbqjGMT7

Please give love this station tv @aplus_arirang @arirangworld, they always support @BTS_twt even since BTS debut and they r unproblematic towards BTS.

@BTS_twt #RM ty to namjoon for spreading your beautiful messages around the world and making the speech in UN. ty for putting out your poems, thoughts, and opinions, and teaching new things to us everyday. thanks to you, i use my imagination better and challenge new things.
Why is #BTSonFallon interview, fortnite and UN speech blocked in this country?? Whyyyy? @BTS_twt

Just found out the daughter of my co-worker is an ARMY. I said, "Yes, just let her be an ARMY. @BTS_twt are a good bunch," before telling my co-workers about RM's UN Speech and turning on the subtitles on their videos.
Lets have little throwback About a week ago, @BTS_twt visited UN to launch the #GenUnlimited campaign. RM (Represented the group) gave the speech abt his experience and encouraged young people to Speak Yourself. Glad to know ppl hear their voice now.

yes your faves have higher PAK but knetz literally don't care about it like they're just ignoring triple crown meanwhile BTS' billboard charts and UN speech became the top discussion in korea not only from gp but also politicians, celebrities and music critics pic.twitter.com/qS4NIFtXuk
Yourel literally an embarrassment to BTS. They be giving UN speech to change the world and yet here you are being a bitch
i was talking about bts' un speech and when i brought it up my mom was like "ewww lol" ??? does she have any tact at all?? SHES REALLY 47 AND SOUNDING LIKE A KPOPPIE ANTI AKJSAJBABS
@kendisgibson I think You owe an apology to 10s of millions of ARMYs and @BTS_twt for what you’ve said reporting their history making UN speech which is making strongest possible positive impact that can have on the youth all over the world... I am sure you are better than that.
Anyways I'm like yea namjoon he was giving a speech @the UN GA. She was like I actually liked his speech. I LOOKED AT HER AS IF SHE WAS CRAZY BC SHE WANTS NOTHING TO DO W/ BTS on top of that she said she has lots of respect for them after she saw that video of Namjoon @the UN+
Then that sampah said bts got chance to go UN for speech bcus of his 2yrs hard work. Sampah indeed la
I just rewatched joon's speech for UN and im crying again oh my God such a beautiful and inspiring speech #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt
me and 2 other ppl have personally requested they show bts’ un speech in the global 2 class bc we kno the teacher hdkdjdj also he found out i speak korean thru some other ppl and is baffled
honestly G.C.F. in Newark is my favorite vlog because it shows just how normal @BTS_twt really is. RM’s speech at the UN where he said he’s a normal 24 year old already made me smile but seeing this vlog highlight that for all the members made me really happy. Thank you Jungkook.
i’m writing a paper about bts making history at the un and i have to do a presentation and instead of presenting i’m just gonna introduce who bts are and then put the speech in because the whole world needs to see it
isn't that the network of that show where one of their anchors recently mocked bts after their UN speech?
Well they will always get hate no matter what cause haters will never stop doing what they are best at which is HATE n spreading negativity Honestly BTS have us n we have them thats all that matters. Also after Namjoons speech at the UN people can shove it. pic.twitter.com/97eFIVq1lh
Stylist Lee Jingyu who worked with @BTS_twt in HYYH series said“Now they're so famous &influential to do UN speech.However their behaviors are same as when they debuted.I recently met them for PUMA styling they were still polite &sincere,they are constant” pic.twitter.com/lE7xZuAcccpic.twitter.com/UtHIdTcLpt
Nostalgia made them interested. Some downloaded a few songs and included them in their playlists. I was making progress. After Namjoon's speech at the UN, 5 of them posted about it on their TLs and tagged me. I had 60 likes in one of my posts. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt
i just had a reunion with my long-time girl friends last night and your gurl here just preached @BTS_twt after they have mentioned RM's UN speech g: i think i should listen to them me: do you want suggestions g: what song me: in what mood do you need #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS

Tbh the UN speech made me think that I’m not as weak as I thought. We’ve been so nice to so many people and yet they still judge us. But Bc of bts you could tell that many friends wouldn’t stay with you for a long time. If they leave u Bc you like KPOP they weren’t going to stay!
[ENG] The Korean TV channel Arirang TV has prepared a special about @BTS_twt #Namjoon, which has become a global leader today. The "A + Story" program will cover the early phase of Namjoon until its UN speech. The special will air on 2.10 at 16:00 (Korean Time) on the Canal.
My husband.. is a BTS anti. I shown him all BTS accomplishments like how bangtan change people's lives and their UN speech but he said "doesnt matter." My plan is to quote BTS lyrics and post them at random times in motivational picture format and see if he can be caught unbiased
Idk what that is, but I'm looking at the comments and Joonie's speech at the UN might help you
Joons UN speech is a gold mine for quotes
use joons UN speech
Urgh, the trolls in this comments section w/ zero followers who made the accounts just to post fanfics who aren't even BTSArmys! Yeah, trust me @TheGNShow, the true fans are gonna wanna hear abt their UN speech & their tour etc & not this. Geez BTS r gonna be mortified...
joon im presenting your UN speech to my entire school on wednesday wish me luck
BTS is respected around the world. They even had a speech for UN and spreading words about self-love yet some of their fans love to spread hate and bringing down other idols. Focus on your faves it's not that hard.
IF @BTS_twt gets nominated for a Nobel Prize it will have NOTHING to do with their UN speech. You can’t get a Nobel prize for a speech unless you are speaking in VERY serious circumstances. Stop thinking a speech can get you a Nobel Prize, there are many other things BTS has done https://twitter.com/YOONMlIN/status/1046806514231578625 …
It’s more than just @BTS_twt’s UN speech though. They’ve been advocating for social awareness before even debut, they’ve helped so many people. Everything said during the speech had already been said by BTS at some point prior. https://twitter.com/choi_bts2/status/1046796128610480128 …
she knows bts thanks to their campaign n the speech at the UN, i was so proud. they r my babies :')
Namjoon, how does it feel to know that your UN speech has made many headlines and is the cause for so many hearts opening up? After your speech a lot of people were welcomed into our beautiful family. Bangtan, what are your reactions to your leader's amazing, eye-opening speech?
People are saying that BTS in the future might get/can get the Nobel Peace Prize, I’ve seen it all over my tl when the UN speech was, as a Swede and Nobel enthusiast I’m thinking that that’s a very small chance but as an Army I’m hoping that it will happen. I’m still skeptical
Mi è piaciuto un video di @YouTube: http://youtu.be/mLBKDeQOp-Q?a GUYS REACT TO 'BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth

WAIT didn’t one of those ARMYs from the future say that this cb will cement bts’ image as socially conscious we all thought it was about the title track but it was actually about their UN speech pic.twitter.com/h6SBctqCfj
Just a reminder to all the beautiful ARMYs around the world that our handsome men @BTS_twt gave a beautiful speech at the freaking UN recently & are constantly writing history #PCAs #BTS #TheGrouppic.twitter.com/YTOEbETqvz
@BTS_twt has proven they are worthy of the social awards through the messages within their songs & the amazingly relatable speech given at the UN for their work with UNICEF. #BTS #TheSocialCelebrity #PCAspic.twitter.com/my7yagGl8J
The speech at the UN is just the first step, we need more than that for a Nobel prize, but it’s possible imo. #AMAs Favorite Social Artist @BTS_twt
The UN speech was definitely a highlight last week, also I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist at the #AMAs⁠ ⁠
What...?! I actually saw some ARMY suggesting it after the UN speech. Has Yoongi's predicting abilities rubbed off on some of us?
it’s only been two weeks since ive last been on here but so much has happened aAAAA i just want to say im so proud of bts being at the UN and that namjoon made a beautiful speech and i love them a lot
Imagine #BTS reunion 40 years from now. The members with their family, their wives, their kids, grandbabies. After a peaceful dinner all of them sat down and watch their old videos, their mvs, their bangtan bomb, their UN speech, bon voyage, their dance practice, BBMAs,
Whilst listening to BTS's speech at the UN, I was reminded of "piece of peace" by hoseok. Such an underrated song with a beautiful message. I'm happy because we all know that @BTS_twt have become at least a piece of peace pic.twitter.com/YbiTnmINBS
To BTS: How does it feel to be the first K-Pop group to speech at the UN? Any plans for 2019? Will Burn The Stage come back for 2nd season? Please come to Philadelphia for your tour next year To Jimin: Will you make a solo album? Can you do sexy dance for your fans? Thank!
Iam alway promoting bts. I did the same to my local friend yesterday and I told her to check the UN speech. pic.twitter.com/zSurs3UaFE

I hope you understand that when I see toxic tweets from any fandom my knee jerk reaction is to defend my boys and I love BTS with all my heart and their UN speech is now my religion lol..but I hope you guys would stop giving attention to the toxic fan base
The year is 2058. BTS-stans all over the world reminisce together, 40 years older with wrinkles and grey hairs. Our children wondering why our eyes fill with tears and smiles light up the room as they produce homework on a certain UN speech 40 years ago. @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1046755200764002304 …
The audacity of PEOPLE who are still finding ways and reasons to hate/criticize BTS after all their appreciated efforts, Namjoon's powerful speech at UN, partnership with UNICEF's endviolence, expressing so much love for youth and humanity at large. You no see? Are you dumb?
can you imagine if BTS wins nobel peace prize someday?? oh my god. that's like pride we had for BTS giving UN speech x 100000000000000 times.
LMFAOO, you’re mad brave for calling idol “noise.” That “noise” sold millions and you will never amount to how hard bts work. Try to fully understand how bts built themselves up, listen to Namjoon’s speech for the UN, listen to their story, the message they sell, and song lyrics.
Thank you so much for inviting @BTS_twt to your show! I hope you'll have a great time together! Their music & personalities are our inspiration everyday! I really hope that you'll talk about their latest Speech at the UN with them, their inspiring Music brought them there. pic.twitter.com/IKbIyI15NU

The guy who did the un speech from bts was in my dream lol
The UN speech!!!! I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist at the #AMAs
He was supposed to cover BTS's UNICEF campaign that raised $1M+ to help victims of abuse and culminated with them giving a speech at the UN... Instead he talked about how they're just popular because they "spread their legs" or bc they're pretty etc etc.
my locals twitter friends have found out about Namjoon's speech at the UN and they were all tweeting me saying that it was very inspirational all I could tell them was "stan BTS stan talent" #BTS #TheGroup #pcas #BTSARMYpic.twitter.com/fVACTuqqIX

Can someone explain to me how BTS become so popular? I mean yeah I like some of their songs. I mean the last time I saw BTS was they perform Spring Day and suddenly they collab with Nicki Minaj and the speech with the UN. I'm impressed (but abit annoyed). Here's why.
What inspired you while writing your UN speech? @bts_twt

bts is on entertainment weekly awhile ago and i kept on screaming KSJAKAJAAAAAAA THEYRE TALKING ABOUT HOW POWERFUL JOON'S SPEECH AT UN IS
I wanna know how your parents reacted after everything you have achieved especially when y’all attended and gave a speech at the UN. #TheMusicVideo #IDOL #BTS⁠ ⁠ #PCAs @BTS_twt
So how far are y’all with the issue on your news anchor bashing BTS and disregarding their speech in the UN? What happened to professionalism? Cause so far it’s just been silent and nothing has been done.
the bts un speech is such a powerful topic to do as presentation u know? i dont care if im gonna be considered weird by my classmates i just wanna let everyone show how inspiring namjoon is thank u
For #ARMYSelcaDay I decided to thank #NAMJOON and @BTS_twt for their UN speech. Thank you BTS for making this world a little bit brighter not only for me but for youth around the world. Credits\\ Children of the Phillipines pic.twitter.com/WyarEbvYku

My sister introduced bts to her bestfriend, showed him the UN speech that Namjoon gave, the mvs and now his bias is Jimin. Wow, doing god's work!
This is not K-pop my friend.. BTS might be Korean but they are making history! Has ever a kpop group won 2 billboard awards, gone to Grammy museum, give a speech to UN and win many other Korean awards? Nope pic.twitter.com/Bg0P7Y5xXC
Lastly, how did each member feel during the speech at the UN General assembly..
What was their feeling when staff told them that they were invited to be interviewed at the Grammy Museum and to give a speech at the UN? @BTS_twt
I've seen a LOT of good questions , so actually use them We've been told to give our opinions but they end up getting THE SAME questions (celeb crush, collab, what BTS mean... ) Ask @NME about the issues they'll talk about in the next serie, feeling for UN/GRAMMY speech... pic.twitter.com/AXQBQBAGjR

China Huanqiu wrote a article about BTS's UN speech~ It's a very influential media in China.
I’m going to talk about Joon’s UN speech tomorrow at the university news broadcast and I am really nervous. I am nervous about what people may think/say. I feel like I’ve failed BTS and Taylor, both have always said to not let what other people think bother you.
hmm yet bts are getting a lot of recognition for their un speech. and obviously views aren't everything but compared to other members solo songs i can see that y'all hate yixing, junmyeon and minseok and can't stream their songs. (they would also know that exo is problematic)

my speaking is kinda prepared for todays school about #globalcitizen and bts speech from un building.i hope everybody will respect how i will explain all this bc its total different tea. but the topic is about new york so why i wouldnt tell this. idc what they will think
Both immediately brought up seeing the broadcast from the UN. They never knew who they were prior to that but were impressed by the speech Namjoon gave and looked up their work with UNICEF. It was pleasantly refreshing and in that moment I was so proud to be a @BTS_twt ARMY
I really hope that they do us right and put Joon’s UN speech as a track on the next album like they did with the BBMAs speech on LY Her. I need to listen to it everyday for my health. Please. @BTS_twt #BTS #PCAs #TheGrouppic.twitter.com/nsLNsFWWlT

how did bts go from serious UN speech to fortnite dances in a day
and im not even hating on bts???? like where tf did i say i hated them or their success, it's armys that i have a problem with, and i never sent them hate for doing their UN speech, ur rlly coming at me for all the wrong reasons.
i'm so so so proud of @BTS_twt !! i still can't believe they gave a speech AT THE UN !!! they are truly beautiful human beings (not only phisically but spiritually? hopefully that makes sense) and they are so down to earth and caring and i love them so muchhhhh
So I showed my mom @BTS_twt's UN speech and told her that it sums up why I love them so much. She's a professor at an uni and she said that they are teaching values of humanities and they are good role models. Oh, and she loves Mic Drop everytime I played the song in the car
@BarackObama hello Mr. President. We miss you. To brighten all our days, did you watch Kim Nanjoon’s speech from @BTS_twt at the UN 73rd assembly? He was inspired by you. I know if would mean a lot to him. Please check the @unicef speech. Link below. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
fortnite dance challenge or un speech can’t choose i vote for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist at the #AMAs
Happy October everyone! The last month we: - Were blessed with LY Tour fancams - Lost Jimin & Tae to the locals - Saw our boys shake the world with their speech at the UN The Sept list is a delightfully long one, here's to another history-making month with #BTS ( #PCAs #TheGroup)pic.twitter.com/OZcBQBP2np
Mmh I think it’s because they did this UN speech that they deserve even more that social artist award.

I haven't said this yet, but I'm incredibly proud of Kim Namjoon for that speech at the UN. Every line was quotable and inspiring...just...poetry. @BTS_twt Stay true to yourselves boys.
Im literally so proud of BTS. Like these boys have come so far and have done so much. There songs have such good messages and this fan base is one of the nicest things i have ever been apart of. Rm's speech was amazing at UN A damn king @BTS_twt #BTS #BTSARMY
my mom randomly talked to me about how bts did a speech at UN and i told her about how they donate money to unicef and all that,, she was so impressed like she actually took them serious for once and i’m so happy about that:)
[ENG] Stylist Lee Jingyu, who worked with #BTS mentioned #BTS: "Now they are famous and influential because they held a speech at the UN. Their behavior has continued the same since the premiere. I have seen them recently for PUMA, they are still polite and sincere"

And I have barely any idea of what the segment is about but I saw the UN speech and the recent appearances and probably some stuff on namjoon AND IS THIS POSSIBLY MY PARENTS STARTING TO UNDERSTAND WHY I LIKE @BTS_twt SO MUCH???
U just dont want Armys to call them the best coz it hurts u &your pressed ass about your faves not gaining the same success &fame like BTS. Just admit that &go. BTS is the best. The KMA Daesang, Grammy Museum Invite&UN speech proves that. What do u have as a proof for your faves?
Many times, when i got hit by their songs, namjoon's speech at the UN, when they were crying emotionally at the concert, and when watching bts history journey & their hardships @BTS_twt #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS https://twitter.com/MINSINGULAR/status/1046418592554717184 …

my grandma shared bts UN speech video on facebook lmao
I saw this comment, I think under the UN speech. That she listens to IDOL but doesn't stan BTS coz she gets overwhelmed with the amount of content they give. I was shocked ahahahhaaha. How can one say no to content?
seriously just cried at dinner while talking abt bts to my mum’s friend.. she told she watched namjoon’s speech at the UN on my facebook page n loved it. im seriously just overwhelmed w pride n love for them
namjoon’s speech at the un
My mom watched namjoon’s speech at the UN without me even knowing and said she loves the message BTS is sharing with the world :)
my mom’s kinda late but now she realizes why i love bts so much bc she just watched joon’s UN speech :(
and its 100 days later i realize joon gave his international age during UN speech so for once didn't age us like we're pushing 60 #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt
I showed my dad the UN speech,,,, AND HE LOVED IT. He respects Kim namjoon and has a new love for bts
I think I picked up BTS back when Boy in Luv released cos one of my friends (cough @ggukreum) introduced them to me but never in my wildest dream would I have known they would be THIS popular today, delivering a damn UN speech jesus christ. That's amazing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b_K5zY-oZs …
Reaction vids of BTS is always trending in Korea, yesterday was German girls reacting to the UN speech then the week before that it was a priest?? reacting to BTS. Karmy loves react vids just as much as IArmy do but that might be a problem.
@ThanthiTV the group u r bashing right nw..is the one who delivered approx. 7 min speech in un...oh! Guess what u aren't aware of #Youth2030 busy! Bashing the group who inspire people on worldwide level...do some research please..we woud very much appreciate it..thank you!
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
& if I may say so, I feel that here, in Europe, this caricature is there even more. We still have a significant amount of work to do to help BTS be free of it, & for ppl to see that they shouldn't be disregarded because of the kpop label. The UN speech will help tremendously!

if they didn't want to be called idol - the most recent iteration being into namjoon's UN speech - then why call the idol instead of not an idol? also bts want to be relatable and reachable.

I saw BTS in World Weekly of CCTV13(the main news channel of China). Stated their speech at the UN. Introduced the theme of their songs. Let the audience know about their recent development and achievements. @bts_bighit @BTS_twt @BTS_ARMY #BTSxUnitedNations #BTS pic.twitter.com/QzaEZI6SvO

The UN speech was the highlight last week and in September. It was so touched and just beautiful. I feel so proud of our boys! "I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist at the #AMAs"
Kpoppie’s oppa: bows 360° Kpoppies: omo he’s so woke BTS: dedicate their time to making music with a message and make an incredible speech at the UN about self love and using your voice Kpoppies: Ugh there goes btshit being fake woke again smh so arrogant and cliché
The UN speech was all I could ask for, both as an aspiring diplomat and as an ARMY. I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist at the #AMAs.
The UN speech was certainly impressive! I was really moved I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs
During April fools when we went from becoming BTS related objects to hello we are beardtan.. that was so much fun! I also enjoyed alot during the UN speech. We were so emotional and positive #TheGroup #BTS #PCAshttps://twitter.com/euphoriatay/status/1046421084747124736 …
CCTV reported BTS's speech at UN. To Tell the Young people to Love Yourself.Their music has struck a chord with many young people.They win the Billboard Top Social Artist and their tweets received the highest number of retweets. pic.twitter.com/eFLy497btI
The next day one told me, I researched abt BTS and watched their UN speech They're not like any other group. She asked what do they do aside from siging and dancing. I told her about the Love Myself campaign and that they write their own songs and each has a story.
Yes!i will definitely think about them for strength! Namjoon oppa's UN speech "speak yourself" 언니ㅋㅋㅋㅋif i see them as fried chicken i might end up laughing..
Today, while riding the bus back home, as I got to my stop, I saw a lady watching Namjoon's UN speech. I am so so proud of @BTS_twt The fact that Joon's speech might be uplifting the GP, is the happiest thing ever, more people can share in the joy the boys have given us! pic.twitter.com/aVcJ21JXAU

Kim Namjoon's speech at UN Generation Unlimited launch was more inspiring and more influencial than most politicians speeches there... The Generic Public's said so, not me. #TheSong #IDOL #BTS #PCAs @BTS_twt
This week is such a blessing week for @BTS_twt Malaysian ARMY -The local news/media and local artists talks about Namjoon's UN speech with positivity -Malaysian ARMY will work together for TaeJin birthday ads -Jimin's chinese fansite did Jimin's birthday ads @THE PAVI
I mean you cant control their music taste but is that a reason on to hate on the group itself because of the fans nah yall hate bts because they are successful and are getting attention for writing meaningful music and spreading message yall even hate on them for UN speech
But they never officially made it here. @BTS_twt has won awards, been on numerous talk shows, and given a speech at the UN. Like Bris said, BTS was inspired by them, but ultimately made it here themselves.
So you telling me joon's speech at the UN was getting hatebecause of his fandom? and if thats's true... how is that ok? LMAO nah. This fandom has done nothing to justify what people keep doing to BTS and hide it behind "their fandom is toxic".
Sorry!! I totally forgot to post these pictures of bts.bighitofficial from their speech at UN General Assembly last Sept. 25, 2018 unicef Im so proud of them! @New York City, USA https://www.instagram.com/p/BoWl27yhwUe/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share&igshid=es11bmqfke16 …
ok. just a reminder that you came under a post about people hatingon BTS' UN speech, & BTS in general, to tell me I'm wrong about how great they are. I'm not btw. Then we are the evil fandom... all we do is mind our favs and stick up for them, why does it affect yall so much
So my cousin approaced me at family dinner and said she started liking BTS cause of joon's speech at the UN. Ugh his impact pic.twitter.com/yd2jEPNQv7
Front page of the Sunday Mag in South Africa the article was about RM’s UN speech pic.twitter.com/jIekQWg0ha
my mom just cried from the un bts speech
that's hard... but maybe LY Tear's comeback show, cause it was my 1st comeback, and it was so fun and cute! or perhaps their speech at the UN, cause I felt deeply connected to them, I really cried, cause their message is really important to me and I'm proud of them :''')
I'm watching the BTS speech at the UN again, and I can only say, I love you Kim Namjoon.
*after watching bts' UN speech* mom: so with your degree, you can work at the UN right? me: uh..... yes
namjoon’s speech at the UN is the only national anthem i know
My mom saw BTS's UN speech on a French TV broadcast called 'C'est L'Hebdo' aaaaaah I hadn't even showed it to her yet but YAY. And some of my dad's colleagues are also talking about @BTS_twt at work, and they are all middle-aged people! Favorite Social Artist #AMAs

Hi. I am going to take the bar exam this November. There were many times that I really wanted to quit but BTS has pushed me to strive harder. Because of their speech at the UN, my dream of becoming a lawyer is now more vivid and I want to work for the UN. Thank you so much BTS.

I just watched RM’s UN speech and my tears cant stop falling down. His message is what I needed the most right now. I am starting to see BTS in a different light.

My aunt (who is not a kpop fan AT ALL) posted Joon’s UN speech on fb and a lot of her friends are so impressed with BTS and their message and how they’re different from other boybands and I’m just so happy people see them and their work
its an old video he took during UN speech day, and he cried at the concert during ttu, maybe he holds a special emotion to that song or it can be his grandfather he lost recently.. dont worry my tae is strong enough to deal with it and he knows that we love him
im gonna go for it and email my world studies teacher if he can show the class bts' speech at the un dhdhhshdh hopefully he says yes
I had a rlly weird dream - bts’ next album came out and the intro to their album was Joon’s UN speech over some beat I never dream about kpop
Honestly we have no real measure of the UN speech impact yet. Even my father saw it (he is a frequent FB user) and got me to explain him about BTS and LY campaign. He was impressed
If the next @BTS_twt album’s skit isn’t Namjoon speech at UN I have something planned pic.twitter.com/RSAwxaj12V
IM DIED A LOCAL RT A TWEET THAT HE THOUGHT WAS TALKING SHIT ABOUT BTS UN SPEECH BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY SHIT TALKING KPOP STANS KAKSKSKSK HE THOUGHT HE DID SUMN
And said he should starve himself? Said Jin had Downs Syndrome? Made multiple death threats against them, Jimin in particular? Dragged Namjoons UN speech without even knowing what it was for? Lmao. Sure. They don’t hate BTS.
After listening to Namjoon’s speech at UN, I was overwhelmed, his words resonated with me. It was beautiful and i am honoured to br a part of this beautiful community BTS you are irreplaceable (That is supposed to be a galaxy my dear friends) pic.twitter.com/Ep7aYZ4u2E

@ThanthiTV Your most recent broadcast about the KOREAN musicians BTS has been extremely uninformed, racist and biased. They have extremely meaningful songs and have recently given a speech in the UN about violence against youth.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak?a [ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy”
i did model UN last yr, and i never expected them to do a speech at the actual one this yr. words cannot describe how proud i am of them.
Before you publish something make sure to know what you are doing don't go speacking some thing stupid. BTS is more than you think! Tamilnadhu is one among the states with more fans. Why don't you post about them being in UN council where they gave an amazing speech @ThanthiTV
Taehyung the view is awesome and you looked so handsome in that suit I can't tell you how proud I am of you boys with the speech at the UN. I purple you!

“nampak perkataan ‘bts’ je terus tutup” hey u salty people they ain’t promote kpop industry during the UN speech i beg u stop being immature lah. Pls have some good thoughts okay...
Could any other ARMYs write an essay or just rant about how talented and beautiful BTS is? If I was giving a day to write about anything I would choose BTS because they deserve it. They started from nothing and worked their way up to giving a speech and the UN and being part of

should I keep a bts un speech paper cutout
My dad finally moved beyond the idea that @BTS_twt was overrated. I was watching the #BTSForYouth2030 UN speech on my TV again & he also silently watched. Finally he said, “I see why you look up to them. Are there any more interviews?” My heartuuu
+ business. Pure business. But all the achievements that BTS has got, the highest being the UN invite and a speech, will never be repeated, by another, for sure. The boys are doing really well now. We'll see what happens.

I need a merchandise for the speech that makes me shed tears of joy pls #PCAs #TheSong #IDOL #BTS⁠ ⁠ @BTS_twt
I saw @BTS_twt a week ago and since then they fully captured Canada ARMYs hearts with their surprise in their last show in Hamilton, they made a speech and inspired millions at the UN, appeared on jimmy Fallon and GMA and performed another 2 concerts, they really are legends
hehehe jk i saw a clip of RM’s speech at the UN conference the other day and had to post a lengthy paragraph explaining why BTS is more than just a boyband with fangirls :’) for my asian ppl to understand that they can’t be mean to me anymore bc
its really funny how these people call nj's speech in UN cliché. After the speech I have friends message me out of nowhere and said the speech is heart touching, both of them is NOT A KPOP FAN or a BTS FAN.
BTS gave a UN Speech I’m forever proud of my boys
@matthewmercer Not sure if you seen the UN speech by Namjoon from BTS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y … I hope I'm not bothering you with this
my brother texted me about bts's UN speech saying how amazing it was he doesn't even listen to bts I'm : proud Of : bts

y’all saying namjoon was plugging bts during the un speech, honey let’s be real not a lot of people watch the whole thing. if the view increased that’s bc of armys. so namjoon plugging bts to armys? sure sis
"The most powerful speech at the UN wasn’t actually from a world leader..!! ARMY, we're witnessing something that trully legendary, something that we may never see again from other artist, it is absolutely just insane.. i'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAspic.twitter.com/bXxf18xqkm
It's bizarre that a boyband conceptualised by an industry known for its highly-manufactured, highly repressed idols, would give a speech on self-esteem and identity at the @UN. But @BTS_twt is not just any #Kpop act, according to fans and experts incl. @jennargibson. #Bts https://twitter.com/SCMPNews/status/1045913636831723520 …

This is also partly why I was so floored by joons UN speech. For him to express himself in his second language in a way that gave me chills? Wow. It's also why I so strongly object to people wanting fully English songs from bts. Their poetry could be lost in a second language
Me to meet you and she said such an important message as BTS speech and work at UN is something she could not possibly miss which is why she watched it).
I think you need to give him Namjoon's UN speech first! And then promote!!!

My friend’s mother shared UN speech with my friend. She asked who it was. My friend told her who it was and added that I was a huge fan of BTS lol. Also, My friends, mostly western artist stans, were very impressed by the speech.
How proud I am whenever I see old Tweets saying « wow BTS’ first ever TV show win ! Army we did that » and now seeing them win dasaeng. How proud I was after this UN speech. +
Honestly, the UN speech did major works for them! It felt like a huge kick to the wall and barriers have been broken down for people who wont even give BTS a chance. Respectable people quoting and spreading the speech! BTS gained respect that they deserved because of it.
I genuinely felt something click during this last week of promo, from their UN Speech to their Good Morning America appearance. If you don't believe it now, I'm pretty sure it will be inescapable by this time next year: BTS is mainstream in America.
I feel like the more bts prove themselves in the US the harder they make it for everyone else. They've set the bar too high, talking about their own self produced and meaningful music at the Grammy Museum and the UN speech. What other act can pretend like they can reach that?
People really think that social media clout = popularity. They don't look at things like album sales, concert ticket sales, visibility with the American general public. BTS may not be liked by everyone, but they're damn near mainstream, especially after their UN Speech.

The members of BTS deserves respect. Speaking at the UN was a great honor and their message is a positive one. I felt that you were making fun of BTS as artists and making fun of RM's actual speech and the use of the English language. Apology needed! @kendisgibson. @ABCNetwork
ALSO bts sometimes get hate for things its not worth talk about??? like ppl saying the un speech was cliche and blablabla or bullying in general Repoting and blocking are always better
@BRISxLIFE @TheJose8A @xCeleste___ @TheJessLyfe @formoftherapy I have a question for you guys. Is BTS the real life Wyld Stallions? After watching the UN speech again Im seriously starting to think it may be true.
went to a party,and one of the teens there saw my love yourself phone case and asked if i know bts. and i said yes,she was surprised that i know them,maybe bcos she considered me old we kind of bonded over their UN speech and her parents are impressed listening to our convo
my mom is even updated with bts and she told me she watched them on jimmy fallon she laughed a lot and watched their UN speech she thinks namjoon has amazing English I STAN
Me ha gustado un vídeo de @YouTube (http://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y?a - The full speech that RM of BTS gave at the United Nations).
Lol so much for bts giving a speech at the UN abt loving yourself and stop bullying and all.. Y'ALL are just hypocrites
@IISuperwomanII awh man ngl i watched ur UN vlog bcuz of bts but wow ur speech was amazinh so thankful to have such a passionate person at the forefront of empowering youths
Hearing Namjoon speak in person is very different than through video. If his UN speech made you emotional, listening to him talk about it is tear-inducing. He's so humble and kind and after that entire concert, it was his words and kind heart that stuck with me the most. #BTS
FYI- the title of this video by USA Today is "How BTS and KPop disrupted mainstream politics" I shared it bc they opened with RM's amazing UN speech and continued to talk about other interesting info in the video
yeah sns is amazing how else are u able to interact with your favs- oh wait anyways did u catch bts at fallon, ellen and kimmel this year? what about their speech at the UN as UNICEF goodwill ambassadors? sns group did that!
Queeen did u see bts’s un speech?? They preached about self love and acceptance and us wanting to change the worldddd pleasee
Namjoon. You are such an amazing leader and have so much talent. Thank you so much for helping bring BTS together, I highly appreciate it. Also your speech at the UN was absolutely incredible and I'm so proud of you for it! Keep going, you're doing amazing and I love you
@USATODAY Disappointed in the way you guys approached BTS’s speech at the UN https://twitter.com/banggutan_twt/status/1046139732772745216 …
This video, instead of addressing the fact that these 7 young men of color, BTS, made a speech at the UN and talking about their message, decided to not only focus on what K-pop is but somehow attribute BTS’s positive influence to the entire industry built on bullshit
BTS are unbothered kings who are on a world tour and who just gave a speech at the UN. It must hurt to see them getting the recognition the deserve. You can stay mad and bitter tho
Tho once BTS has established themselves and they’re seen as artist before they’re seen as a “kpop grp” then kpop can go viral til it’s heart content. BTS’s UN speech and Grammy interview helped them out a lot and I’ve noticed more favorable articles written about them
People are slowly starting to differentiate BTS from other kpop groups. Both in Korea and in the West. The UN speech and Grammys interview helped a lot
@ABCNetwork @abcWNN @kendisgibson Kendis Gibson’s remarks on BTS”s UN speech are ignorant, xenophobic and unprofessional. He had no idea of who they are or their accomplishments. Had Mr. Gibson learned a foreign language on his own and break world records? Shame on him.
Did they met lily singh tooo on the day of UN speech??

BTS used their music 2 send great messages 2 the youth,revealed very personal struggles theyve been through 2 help their fans,went to the UN 2 give the most motivating speech while continuing 2 succeed,& yall still say "tHeYrE JuSt A kPoP gRoUp" well what has your crusty ass done https://twitter.com/pearltaes/status/1046054846355394562 …

... No it’s not just the fandom it’s both which kpoppies have proved time and time again, yesterday being one of those times with trying to drag Namjoons UN speech, dragging or having a sly dig at BTS & ARMY is the only way people get like and retweets these days
Maybe he is the youngest and not the smartest, but his speech is the most relatable to young people problem right now. You should admit that BTS's songs has made many people survive to their life better than any UN project before. #BTS @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations #BTSARMY #MPN
I know when I watch Namjoon's speech at UN, some people will say that his speech are fake, etc. But if you watch it from the begining, you will understand that Namjoon's speech is the most sincere speech among other speaker. #BTS @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations #BTSARMY #MPN
Knowing BTS ad Namjoon, they probably dropped hints to their next album in the speech that they gave at the UN
Y’all hate BTS too, stop using the fandom as an excuse, yesterday they threw Namjoon shit for the speech at the UN, hypocrites
No one hates bts that's why kpopies called rm UN speech clinche just yesterday with thousands likes, making fun of jhope beauty, trended #in 2015 that almost ended their career, accuse them of sajaegie and plagiarism everyday, I can continue tbh.
And more BTS is the only kpop artist to top billboard 200 Twice in a single year within the gap of 4 months with an non English album and give speech at UN headquarters general assembly sold out whole city field tour as a solo group in 15 minutes and so on pic.twitter.com/9WWUQL54OJ
I just wanna leave this here, i asked my mum to listen to joons speech at the UN and she did,, she texted me about how touching the speech was and she cried. So i went to her room after she told me she downloaded the speech and we watched it together and she teared up @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/U2XBlvyOvU
Guess who just got ask again about the UN speech of RM! LOL. My colleagues at work who dont know @BTS_twt been coming up to me telling me they heard RMs speech and that he was so eloquent and his message was received. OMG. I wanna cryyy!

im from the future YALL ARE INFLUENCING THE PLANET NOW . U GAVE A UN SPEECH . Im crying
You're doing so amazing Joon in the future the world is so proud of you YOU GAVE SPEECH AT THE UN you made your country and your armies PROUD WE LOVE YOU
Hi namjoon, most known as RM, is the leader of the South Korean group BTS. He's well known as someone who tries to encourage others to love themselves, as he has had a lot of trouble loving and accepting himself in the past. You can check his UN' Speech. https://youtu.be/oTe4f-bBEKg
And I'd also like to say one last thing... RM UN speech 4 years later
JUST MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEAR MY MOM LISTENING TO BTS’ UN SPEECH

why the heck would he talk about the Kpop industry in South Korea when the point of the campaign is to encourage young ppl all over the world to use their own voice to tell their own story, hence HIS WHOLE SPEECH??? Do you even know why BTS were in UN summit to begin with?
I truly don't care when haters came to BTS because they are jealous but when you came to something so serious like UN speech. Dude like you don't have to like them but you should respect that one young man had huge honor and got respect for something like this.
The message namjoon spoke about during his UN speech was clear as day even non-fans understood and praised him for delivering a speech in a 2nd language powerfully. If you are dragging him based on your hatred for bts or armys then idk who comes off as a loser here lol pic.twitter.com/ObVDorKwNo
Already w parents/older colleagues asking abt bts I've used the speech as a talking point like,, an older gen often doesn't know/care abt AMAs or BBMAs but the UN? That's big. They get that.

Thank you for inspiring people. This reminds me of 'Speak yourself'. I hope you saw the UN's speech of @BTS_twt
lmao they made a speech at the whole fucking UN cause they trend really? y’all are so delusional and would do anything to deny that bts are the biggest group in the world with the most impact
joon looks so confident lately after his mind blowing speech in UN. it's feel like he's so proud of BTS and himself. im so happy for u guys. u deserved the @BTS_twt @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs
How do you even misinterpret Namjoon’s UN speech to be cliche, there’s no other reason except that he’s in BTS. He’s getting praise from a global audience and literally advocating for the GenU campaign about speaking for yourself. Miss me with your bs
GOOD MORNING, I'M STILL NOT OVER NAMJOON'S SPEECH AT THE UN AND I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE |Favorite Social Artist #AMAs@BTS_twt|
Malaysian HLive reporting on BTS’s UN speech pic.twitter.com/MamA3Uyjx1
they don't even know WHY bts got invited to deliver a speech at the UN, brave of them to call the speech cliche meanwhile they don't even know what's the event's purpose. they're the ones who doesn't understand. they only want to drag everything bts do. sad.
my mum asked me about why i like BTS when my army bomb arrived. i told how about their music and how it helped me when i was in my worst period then talked about their personalities and then i talked about Joons speech at the UN and she was impressed and wants to listen. pic.twitter.com/NKQAsSOr7D
Wow in the speech pic #Suga is totally behind #RM you can't even see him !
I keep.on rewatching @BTS_twt speech at UN. Beautiful and so meaningful #BTS #BTSxUnitedNations #BTS pic.twitter.com/grGyxOKWyO
Can't believe people that SAID they don't hate bts but only armys. Y'ALL ACTUALLY GIVE A THOUSAND LIKES AND RTS TO THE POSTS THAT CALL JIMIN A FAT PIG BITCH AND COMPARE RM'S SPEECH IN THE UN TO A POOP. Y'ALL KAYPOPPIES R REALLY SOMETHING ELSE
as u always listen to UN'S SPEECHES i bet u didn't know something called UN before BTS got a chance to give a speech there , a brainless dude like wouldn't even care abt politics!

kpoopies hating on namjoon's speech because their mind is limited to the fact that it's BTS who is giving a speech at the UN and they hate them for some twisted reason that honestly seems to go way beyond just not enjoying their music, is annoying mostly because BTS are actually+
Can MY ARMY stop engaging with meleis big accounts? We gotta stop leaving bad impression to locals now that BTS gotten the spotlight and gave better impressions for their UN speech, lets just leave it to that. Dont spoil it.Educate those who clearly interested and ignore haters.
and even tho, they still talk how proud of BTS' End Violence campaign and Namjoon's UN speech, they are... It's just sad.
Do not say to stop saying this cuz this is actually happening now. You don’t have any right to say people not to raise their voices. Don’t you remember what RM said in the UN speech? This does not have anything to do with #BTS, but with #BigHit

남준, you gave an amazing UN speech, particularly by saying (1) "gender identity" instead of just "gender" & (2) "skin color" instead of "race."

what is he shaking his head for huh?? BUNCH OF BOY BANDS FROM KOREA?? REALLY so UNPROFESSIONAL!! IDK WHAT’S SO FUNNY ABOUT THERE SPEECH AT UN! ARMY’S AND BTS NEEDS AN APOLOGY !THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!
@ABCNetwork : @kendisgibson was biased, xenophobic, and ultimately disrespectful in reporting the recent UN speech by Kim Namjoon of BTS. He mocked the fact that they’re trying to spread a positive message simply because they’re a boyband. Please review this and his role at @ABC
so y'all got the audacity to tell me that namjoon's speech at the un was so irrelevant and that it was so unnecessary for them to be at the un. wow, even your faves aren't in bts level. like bitch before you badmouth them, make sure that your faves are on the same level as them.
This what we not gonna do. BTS has a big youth fan base and they are youth themselves so yes they went to the UN AND DELIVERED A SPEECH THAT SIMPLY HATEFUL PEOPLE LIKE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
Okay I seriously wasnt going to get involved kn this shit but this “fake woke” and “cliché” thing going around BTS’s speech at the UN is way too stupid even for yourselves.
oh so kpoopers are talking shit abt bts speech in the un oh why am I not suprised pic.twitter.com/AJHMbYDiqs
Why dont you start with the emotional introductions to BTS . Then the funny ones. Perhaps NOT TODAY MV. Or the UN speech first???? He might like what joint said.
bts: get top social artist award kpoppies: issa dumb award bts: get top album on the billboard chart kpoppies: who cares abt western validation bts: give a speech at the fucking UN kpoppies: how cliche yall are gonna say grammys are overrated one day...

they're calling joon's speech at the un cliché bc they know their faves will never get the same recognition and acknowledgement from the un the way that bts did

At the kpoppies that are dragging BTS/Namjoon over his UN speech, please, take a good, long, hard look in the mirror. Then go choke yourself with your words bc you're choosing to ignore a powerful message bc your favs aren't as popular. Pls. Go. Choke.

You should listen BTS UN speech may be your point of view for them get changed they give a 7 minute speech in this they also talk about Thier music journey struggles and self love
To all BTS haters who mock their UN speech. https://twitter.com/CYPHERWHAT/status/1045971650271830016 …
RM’s UN speech really made an impact especially on dads. My own doesn’t really support me & my mom’s “fan-girling” moments w/ @BTS_twt BUT a few minutes ago while we’re eating lunch he suddenly said & I quote “Did you know that your RM made a speech in the UN? I saw on YouTube.”
Dont let your hate for bts blind you about them having a speech in UN. Kpop and spreading peace & love to the world is two diff thing. Y’all just think of all those kpop fandom petty wars. Its just sucksss your soul out.
Hhhhhhhh tbh I was expecting locals to be pressed over BTS' UN speech, not other kpop stans. It's legit so funny that they can put down even one of the most honorable appearance in history. I won't be surprised if they say the same thing when BTS eventually goes to Grammy.
*BTS gives a speech at the UN* Kpop stans : this shit is so basic.. how are they any special
After impressing the world with #Rm's 7-min heart-felt speech at the #UN, #BTS made a stop at #Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show to talk about the highlights of their stay in #NY city. https://youtu.be/x5HUs5IxFc0 via @YouTube
One of my friends who isn’t an army but knows I love bts texted me namjoon un speech and was like “you probably saw this already but wow” DO YOU SEE THIS MANS INFLUENCE IM CRYING FUCK pic.twitter.com/qGnTWrNmzK
kpoppies saying that BTS' speech at the UN is cliché when they even don't know what's the point of the speech, lmao
Stop making kpop is the damn fault in this country. LIKE UHM "BTS ARE PLASTICS". UM, HAVE U WATCH THE UN SPEECH???? NO??? UM YEAH THATS WHAT I THOUGHT. CLOSE YOUR STINK MOUTH.
We love a PR agency doing a great job. #RM speech is so inspiring and #BTS appearances on @jimmyfallon #TheTonightShow and @GMA are iconic. #PCAs #TheGroup @BTS_twt
My father just called me to see the news and said there something "interesting" GUESS WHAT!? IT WAS BTS AND RM'S SPEECH AT THE UN. THEY SHOWED A SNEAK PEAK OF INU AND FAKE LOVE AND ALSO SHOWED RM'S CUTE PICS IN BETWEEN. OMO I THINK WHOEVER IS DOING THIS IS RM BIASEDREALLY.
that whole thread irked me like that anti really just wanted to undermine bts they didn't even care that some armys are really trying to explain his un speech but uhhh idk stay bothered sis! we'll love and support our own faves and whatever you say won't affect them!!
My prof just mentioned RM's speech in UN during our Clinical psychology class I'm so proud of you bbs @BTS_twt Time to make clinical assessments owwusgdhdjdjj
My mom really did watched every bts performances in america. She said 'the one who speak english fluently' is charismatic. She even watched full version of BTS's speech in UN and she's happy when i said they're my role model!
And those people prolly need a therapy called as BTS i swear the speech they gave at the UN will make them regret.. And open up their tiny little brain
bold of you to assume they have any idea what bts are doing at the UN in the first place or even listened to the speech LOL
The girl screaming, “YOU DID GREAT!!” When Joon mentioned his UN speech. Same girl, same. @BTS_twt #MPN #BTS #btsarmyhttps://twitter.com/wanqsxian/status/1045868022878089218 …
I’m still touched with RM’s speech at the UN. He is just amazing, incredible and so smart. Im so proud of him and also of @BTS_twt they are achieving a lot of good things. They really deserve all of that. #방탄소년단
my cousin who doesn't understand why im active supporting BTS. Now understand when he finally saw the lyrics and music they're making, also he saw the news abt UN speech which giving him wider perspective towards the boys
I’m so fucking pissed. I see BTS being posted on CNN where they talk about their UN speech and instead of seeing idk maybe pride or something positive it’s filled with hatred. When will people fucking learn that their negative ass comments only make them look like idiots? pic.twitter.com/NV2Dlt3M0u

My friends don’t seem to think it’s good for me to love a Korean “boyband” so much. I sent Namjoon’s UN speech to a few of them and this is one response I got. I hope they understand now why they are not just a “boyband” and never will be. 내인생에 있어줘서 고마워요 BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/mrP2moHfWT
I think Namjoon has been one of the most judged & criticized one out of BTS (from his looks & mistakes he has done) That's why I think his UN speech holds a lot of meaning. It shows how he is just a human who makes mistakes. It's how he learned from them that matters in the end
My relatives told me out of nowhere how they admire BTS’ UN speech and I told them he’s the leader and they told me they were amazing. Omggggg pic.twitter.com/KgQXpkr3JK
My dad switch on TV to watch news..there's a news about my Prime Minister give his speech in UN..suddenly my mom tell my dad that @BTS_twt gave speech there too...I feel proud!also a news about earthquake and tsunami at Sulawesi..I pray for your safety
Can't believe that there are actually people out there spreading hate on Namjoon's speech at the UN. Can you not? If you don't really understand the campaign & the speech itself might as well ask yourself if you did something good for a greater number once in your life. #BTS
The UN speech probably is the best way to comfort my parents for letting me love BTS as well
another kpoppie popping veins over the fact BTS got invited to give a speech at the UN and their faves didn't, what's new
Y’all: RMs speech was cliche Armys: He was speaking himself thats the whole point- Y’all: He should have spoke about problems in S.Korea Armys: But its about the youths- Y’all: xyz paved the way for Bts at UN Armys: But Bts partnered w/ UNICEF- Just say yall hate Bts and go pic.twitter.com/kjneCeyDrb
BTS IS THE BEST no words are there to describe the and there was nothing funny abt their historical speech at the UN assembly. THE DESERVE MORE THAN RESPECT.......
Hello Namjoon @BTS_twt I used your speech in UN for my MUET.
RM's voice at his speech on UN was the best @BTS_twt
Can’t believe a kpop girl group stan is hating on BTS about RM’s speech from UN GA. It’s like hating other kpop groups who participated to the Unicef campaign lol it’s not only BTS girl. So when your fave joined the campaign you’re gonna unstan them too??
y’all find any reason to hate on bts, targeting their speech at the UN lmfao imagine taking the time out of your day to listen to their ENTIRE speech and then take an extra 10 seconds to tweet/post against it
THANK YOU All these ppl claiming they’re all for BTS’ love and peace message and retweeting their UN speech like nobodies business are the same ones clowning this teenager for her hairline and speech impediment
Those who hv been touched by BTS Namjoon’s speech will cry their ass off listening to Tun M’s at 73rd UN general assembly.

Introduced my Uber driver to BTS tonight after the concert, he asked what was going on and I told him about them and recommended he check out the UN speech and Jimmy Fallon. He likes hip hop in other languages and seemed really interested! Tonight was lovely.
My class teacher came and asked us who nj was and that the speech he gave at UN was so inspiring. She loved it sm she even shared it. She said she learnt to start loving herself. She even brought her phone and played the vid to our class bc "its smtg everyone should hear" :')
I hope Namjoon can do VLive and talk about his experience on UN.. like from the time when he wrote his speech and stuff. @BTS_twt I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs

kpop did not gave the speech at the UN conference, BTS DID. Check your facts please.

If the UN had the audacity to laugh at the goddamng president of the US, what was stopping them from laughing at BTS if they believed their speech was shit? Nothing, but you see the respect they had? That's not something they just got cause they were "scared of ARMY".
bts didn’t create end violence campaign with un to bring awareness on violence children around the world face, went to the youth 2030 as ambassadors and namjoon give a whole 6-min speech about encouraging to use your voice on issues you value just for y’all to say it’s “”cliche””
people really are trying to undermine BTS UN speech , I get you don’t like them but to put down their whole message of positivity and self love just to look cool and edgy is so nasty just shut up and go

the amount of haters that bash namjoon speech at the UN it's so funny bc they seem like kpoppies while the gp keeps talking about how bts are such great role models, they see why people love them and the importance of their message,, ugh an advice for those haters: love yourself
can’t believe i read with my own two eyes someone say with their whole chest that joon’s un speech was “cliche” and “vague” as if you’re not just salty that BTS are really making a difference with their messages and music and are being recognised and asked to speak out about it
cake pop stan really drag bts' UN speech? istg they share one brain cell

Can't believe , so many of you still dumb af and discredit Namjoon speech for UN.. They are there as a representative sharing their own struggle n how they confront it to be as today ..is it that hard to understand? Just say u hate everything revolve around BTS and go
SKSKKS when the school showed the bts un speech i cried within the first 5 seconds indjdjfjdjjjddjd im the worst
Since the speech at the UN, I've seen parents interested in BTS and many of them understand now our love for them. It's amazing bcs that platform gave a different spotlight on the boys and showed them as who they are, socially conscious artists. I'm happy for you
I’m seeing ppl call joon’s speech at the UN 'cliche' as if the whole event waSNT centered around and for the youth, or that speeches after joon’s didn’t go along the same lines smh bts are out there inspiring a whole movement, and what are yALL doing?
Y’all being annoying and hating on namjoon for doing his speech at the UN is so childish y’all faves would be “don’t worry be happy i love you” and y’all be AWWWJS:((( I LOVE THEM :(( don’t act like y’all wouldn’t be the same if it were your faves y’all just hate bts

Antis, Let's us be honest. RM speech during UN was really clear, on point and critics approved it. So stop pretending smart and admit that ur just stupid and cannot comprehend. Also, ALWAYS remember that ur faves can't relate with BTS success.
bts: [gives a Speech at UN] antis, running out of insults: omg this speech is so vague why didnt they just do it on vlive
Big companies, what bts is doing is breaking down walls for those small grps from small companies you kpoopies dont care about, after the UN speech think that people will take kpop seriously, and i wonder why after bts charted in many charts in bb and other charts, almost all
Kpop stans shitting on namjoon's speech whereas their faves can't even breathe near UN! It's your faves' music that is vague and cliché, stay pressed! Your faves won't be ever able to accomplish one hundredth of what BTS have achieved in only five years! Stay Salty Sweatys
My dad was listening to CBC radio and they talked about BTS!!! He said they mentioned the UN speech and possibly heading to the grammys. He said he got really excited because usually he doesn't listen to pop culture segments but for BTS he listened to the whole thing
wanna talk shit abt bts so bad why dont yall give a UN speech then too and see if yall can do any better lol
Some non-ARMY kpop stans are really dumb. I'm sorry, but the fact that you missed the whole gist of Namjoon's UN speech coz you want them to promote KPOP when the campaign BTS represent is about YOUTH EMPOWERMENT in general.. do y'all have -100 brain cells? Sad.
So the student council in my school talked about BTS' UN speech at rollcall today and my ARMY ego shot up the sky @BTS_twt
kpop idol: has a rainbow things kpoppies: omg they’re so nice. what an angels bts: gives speech to un, encourage to speak your voice, love yourself kpoppies: clićhe see the difference? your bs minds will never change. i didn’t expected it to
My dad just saw Namjoon's UN speech on his Facebook timeline and asked me about it and he's really shocked and impressed... I talked to him about BTS' philosophy and he said, "Doing things like this makes them more than just a band." and when I say I'm finna cry,,, I'm not lying
@jamesgoldston Kendis Gibson's comments on BTS and their speech at the UN were downright xenophobic and absolutely disgusting. Unacceptable whatsoever. I am greatly disappointed by this and urge you to reconsider Mr. Gibson's position. I also expect a sincere apology on his part.
If you ever want inspiration just read bts lyrics and rewatch their UN speech
And if yall really cared, u would have actually GOOGLED (at least) why bts received the invitation to stand before the UN and what was the correlation between their speech and the main topic of the assembly. But kpoppies don’t give a fuck. Dragging Bts is all y’all think abt
Loved talking about BTS and their week here in NY! They are putting in the work and are CRUSHING IT! From their historic speech at the UN to their performance at GMA, I was happy to break it all down on my show tonight #TANGORRATAKEOVER @1061BLI
Is that your job? To run yalls mouths without doing research? If this was your fave achieving such things and giving speech at UN everyone would SCREAM and SCREECH about it and put your idols on pedestal. BTS attended the assembly because they DESERVED to be there.
I usually don't do this but to all antis discrediting #BTS for their UN Speech just because it wasn't their idols who were invited, please use your time instead to focus on being fans of your respective idols. Maybe it's time to love yourselves instead of hating us and BTS.
Wow. So you have a problem with a UN speech that has a good overall message. BTS is using their social platform to push a positive agenda and you still doodoo on it GOOD LORD, the REACHING going on here
@abcWNN, after your report on BTS's speech at the UN, I'm incredibly disgusted by the lack of professionalism and racist remarks made by Kendis Gibson. This is unforgivable and I'm really surprised that you've let this matter go. Degrading, xenophobic and ultimately disappointing
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
like, they did a speech at the freaking un and no idol (that I saw) said a peep? idk man, maybe i'm expecting too much but I find that weird. to me it seems the industry is only interested in what bts is doing when they are trying to replicate it and that's kinda sad
That is actually the real reason why some posts about antis mocking BTS's speech showed up. They're frustrated because UN is the place where even their companies' money, their fave's sales, their companies' influences can't touch it. Don't bother about it, ARMY.
For those asking for an update, (that was really sweet ps) Kiddo did not win his election today. He was pretty crushed & hard on himself. I showed him the UN speech again. He loves RM. He was quiet and then said “you can’t speak yourself if you give up.” Thank you, RM. @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/MZTb3y79hJ
When #BTS dominating Billboard, charts, sales, even interviews in US, other fandoms or maybe other companies might think they can still chase them. But BTS giving speech in UN? Man, how can they outdid that? This is the real reality of BTS's impact.
people at the UN were lining up to talk to them and influential members were writing congratulatory messages to joon and bts on social media but if a couple bitter kpop stans feel like the speech was weak i guess it really must’ve been :/
bts speaks at the un and all antis can come up with is that the speech was cliche........... i have to laugh
why are people mad bts made a speech at the un?? do i see your faves doing that?? no?? they're out here inspiring thousands of people regardless, don't make this about some petty fanwars just move along and mind your business if you got nothing nice to say
I can't rank their songs because I like them all, But I very often listen to LOVE MYSELF ANSWER after RM's UN speech @BTS_twt #TheSong #IDOL #PCAs #BTS https://twitter.com/JJRyanOnAir/status/1045784971032645632 …
omg?? i was just reading tweets about their un speech and they’re on tv!! @BTS_twt #lpic.twitter.com/B1vJDAo4cA
Whether it was Lily's "Young people make up 25% of the population, but we make up 100% of the future." or RM's inspirational speech, I will never forget it. Thank you so much for having them speak to us youths that day. And thank you for #GenUnlimited!pic.twitter.com/tV4Wu3B5oN
y’all would do anything to hate on bts and armys. namjoon gave a speech about speaking for yourselves as youth at the UN and u have the nerve to shit on it and say its not that big. your morals are so questionable. i am so tired i’m going to bed now bye i hate this hellsite
My family members and friends on Facebook were all taken away by his words. Namjoon deserves all the credit he gets for representing BTS at the UN with a speech that is linked to the message Bangtan has been spreading since their debut.
today my mom told me she read about "my" bts on BBC and she told me she loved joons UN speech! she said it was amazing and that she really liked it!
all these salty bitches talking shit about joon's UN speech to hype up their faves. you bitches WISH your faves were that relevant. keep talkin and BTS will KEEP prospering. stay mad.
My baby didnt give a whole speech infront of the UN to represent positive change and encourage positive for ignorant ass people to be like “BTS aint even that good ” wow people really be one track minded how sad
Thank you for giving @BTS_twt a chance to relay their msg to the World. Theyre such an inspiration to many of us. I hope many young people got inspired and motivated from his speech.
their pressed selves can hate on bts all they want but it won't change the fact their faves haven't even been near the un, let alone present a speech there
They think their faves deserved to give a speech at UN cause their faves almost always sings only about romance & most of the time not write their lyrics. So they think BTS is undeserving because they SiNG & TALK about sensitive topics while doing helpful campaigns for the better
kpoppies still think the UN speech was about kpop or sth... bts didnt get invited bc they are a kpop group, honey. they got invited because theyre making a difference
my brother came over yesterday, the one who kind.of hates bts and their boy bandish ways. i was telling him about their speech at the UN because he always makes fun of them that they can’t speak english and i get annoyed. but i was telling them about the generation 2030 and the
It's amazing how the UN speech changed so many people's perspective on BTS
imagine watching a 7 minute speech of a group you don’t like just to tweet hate about them.. at the end of the day everyone knows what separates bts from the rest which is the reason why they’re the ones speaking at UN and y’all faves aren’t
I also hope that those who made fun of or questioned Namjoon’s speech will learn to love themselves and speak themselves. Even if they don’t agree w/ BTS being at the UN, they still deserve love. I hope they find that in themselves.
some kpop stans think namjoon didn't have a meaning to his speech and that there wasn't any reason for bts to be on UN... Like don't be salty that they got invited and not your faves so stop if you thought you did something you didn't so stop makin yourself look stupid before ar- pic.twitter.com/dMDC8uDDiy
Reading through some of the translated comments on Naver link from @BigHitEnt. A lot of them seem to be from parents of ARMYs who are impressed by @BTS_twt UN speech and GMA performance, but this one about how her husband has now started listening to them was too cute pic.twitter.com/ZAxLb59pYP
Oh the irony of it all, that someone supporting EXO, has the nerve to talk shit about BTS UN speech, saying how they feel EXO should have done it instead.
edgy antis coming for the UN's speech again cuz they have nothing else to do and their favs are flopping #BTS #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt

Such a good read! I love all the solos from Wings, but Reflection has always been the least “comfortable” for me. I think it struck too close to my own feelings.

kpoppies don't know what arguments to use against bts so they pull the last string and call joon's un speech cliché....like you can TELL they desperate
Kpoppies dragging Namjoon speech at the UN. When they’ll have a 148 QI I’ll talk to them #AMAs Favorite Social Artist ( @BTS_twt) pic.twitter.com/BdkA0UVQd3
would i get hate if i said bts’ speech at the UN wasn’t 'amazing' as many people might say....
kpop stans ain't got nothing to drag bts for, so now they're trying to undermine their UN speech.
y’all are so..... namjoon’s speech was amazing and bts being at the un to speak for young people was a huge accomplishment
Don’t get mad at BTS for giving a speech at the UN Headquarters. They earned it all they deserved to be there. I bet half of you all saying shit didn’t even listen to Namjoon’s speech They don’t work this hard for nothing, so shut your mouth before too much shit falls out of it
So y’all now gonna come after BTS’ UN speech. I have to say y’all are at some next level shit. Just say you hate them and anything they do and go. Stop with the bullshit nonsense just to bring them down and go stream your irrelevant faves.
I wonder if IARMYs hate SK, Koreans & KARMYs except BTS. I see SK doesn’t deserve BTS & others. NJ’s UN speech about speak yourself, I guess it only applies when it goes w majority. Have a different opinion then people r bullied. Sad commentary. Love yourself & Speak yourself.
some people would drag Namjoon's speech no matter what he would say. Did you expect him to end world hunger or something? He was supposed to talk about himself and inspire us to not be afraid to be ourselves because that's what bts stand for. This is why UNICEF and UN chose them.
Honestly, no one could've been a better voice for youth than BTS themselves. Joons speech at the UN told a story of him as a young boy and how he came to love himself. he wanted youth to hear his story and that like him, we have a story&voice too. that we should speak ourselves
People trash talking joons speech at the UN saying the speech didn’t have a meaning or point basically bashing bts for being there bc “why is there a kpop group at the UN”
If some other group did a speech at the UN and Armys said this shit we'd have a bunch of kpop stans screaming about how toxic we are etc you kpop stans just love to hate anything that BTS does pic.twitter.com/bxx1D6ciaX
are people... actually hating on namjoons un speech good fucking bye that was so fucking powerful and personal and original. tl sucks time to watch bts !!!
Bts UN speech was so well respected by many people and even the UN itself now I know for a fact the people who r calling it basic r just bitter and sad..... the speech touched so many ppl of all ages , say u hate bts and go .
You know what the fact that people are mad pressed about bts attending the UN and giving a speech just proves that the boys made it and they deserved to be there more than anyone
why would bts talk about kpop and the industry in a speech that’s meant to be for the youth...for finding yourself...the UN literally asked them to speak about it bc it’s what pertains to their campaign. i swear y’all don’t be knowing shit but try to sound smart please shut up
he was invited to do a speech in the UN assembly. He was invited to tell his story (hust like superwoman told hers after bts). He was invited to encourage the millions of youg people who watch and follow him. And he did it.bow if u have smth to say go there and do better https://twitter.com/Linsuspls/status/1045769578993905665 …
and how they gonna say ‘can’t bts give the speech on vapp’ skksks the UN literally invited them
lmao fr we don’t have anything to prove to dumbass kpoppies, BTS were at the UN generally assembly and everyone there loved their speech. yall not even worthy to make a comment. we all know that you’re jealous&will use any excuse to shit on bts. well they stay winning. always.
Brainless Kpop Stans dissecting Joons UN speech instead of minding their fucking business. They are so damn bothered by bts success. I’m tiredt
Ppl are pressed joon thanked armys in his un speech? Maybe that's bc a good number of armys are considered youth, we are aware of bts's campaign involving their music, and he glorified us briefly bc he's proud we were able to take part in such a meaningful unicef campaign
they got invited to the UN and gave their speech cuz they are relevant and they always cared about UNICEF compaign and that's what they talked abt in their speech, next time you get invited to the UN tell them that bts speech was cliché
The amount of people comjng at namjoons un speech from random racist and homophobic locals to kpoopers who will drag anything related to bts like at least bts are making a positive change in the lives of millions and they got to speak at the UNITED NATIONS of all places

@TIME Should include @BTS_twt as " 100 most influential people in the world " by next year. Their appearance and speech at @UN And successful @bts_love_myself campaign speaks louder. #bts impact and influence is no joke any more @BTS_twt as favorite social artist at #AMAs

#BTSARMY #MPN @BTS_twt 1. Totally inspired by speech at UN > especially for the expression "gender identity", it reveals his will and attitude for learning, changing and developing. 2. Some people asks more of his responsibility, like as Senators,, Cracks me up! FUNNY
he speaks more eloquent than President trump at the UN General Assembly and the fact that he actually wrote the speech ,Only BTS can relate
Just sayin to be honest- Namjoon you are such a BAE and by the way i thought your speech at the UN was really inspiring. I hope your enjoying your time on tour with the boys and Bts bon voyage #LoveYouNamjoonpic.twitter.com/u8fFElL5w7

When I arrived at my Korean class this evening, one of the first thing my teacher mentioned was BTS' UN appearance and speech. Ahhhh my ARMY ego just went up so high. Huhu
The kmedia write dumb articles about bts rather than actual good ones. Till now I didn’t see any good article about the UN speech and namjoon message. They didn’t even quote his legendary line. Instead they talked about the First Lady with them and the watches and Thats it
Oh God just want to say that @BTS_twt couldn't have better leader than Namjoon is. They really couldn't. Thank u so soo much for your words RM... Since your speech at UN guys, whenever I have any doubts, it helps. I don't know how. Just thank you for being

IM SO SOOO SOOOOOOO PROUD OF YOU GUYSSSSSS!! YOU DONT KNOW HOW HAPPY I AM RECEIVING THOSE NEWS, GIVING SPEECH ON UN SECOND, PERFORMING ON GMA AND YOU GUYS ARE INVITED ON THE MOST POPULAR TALKSHOW ON UK IM SO PROUUUUUUD!!! @BTS_twt my favorite artist #AMAs
Artist of the year is given to the artists who received positivity from the gp. With the un speech and B.B. 200 twice in a year they would have to give it to BTS
So a friend of mine that is NOT into kpop just told me he checked out the UN speech and he's amazed of how good the speech is and how namjoon is calling out the youths to speak yourself and love yourself. He checked out BTS on Jimmy Fallon+ #BTS ⁠ #TheGroup #PCAs @BTS_twt
After Joon's UN speech, my irl colleagues sharing @BTS_twt videos on FB and my Army heart can't be more prouder. I'm so excited to talk to them about the boys but being patient, i want them to explore the boys more as they will eventually fall in love as well.
So, a friend sent me a message saying they saw @BTS_twt ‘s speech at the UN and their perf on @GMA. After a couple of exchanges... F1: So, what songs would you reco? Me: *takes a deep breath and sends 2C4S to LYA*
So, i told my dad about joon speech at the UN and ask him to give it some time to read. And guess what whos staning @BTS_twt now? . Im so proud of them omg.

Hi, just wanna share this. Today, i never thought i'll have a conversation with my Team Lead about #BTS. She's not into KPOP or don't have knowledge about idol groups, but i think after the UN speech the public got to know and see them way beyond as a kpop group. @BTS_twt
Yeah asking about their positive message,UN speech and their song writing it's my dream that to happen coz this World needs someone like them
Awwww this! Make me like a proud mama. Can you guys imagine that u guys really did a speech at UN?? become presenter of the youth?? u guys become our voices?? u guys did it!!! please be proud of yourself too!!
yknow a few months ago i was researching about UN and a few days ago BTS just gave a speech at the UN. coincidence I think not
I also didn’t say that RM should change anything about his speech. I merely said that I was confused about that phrase
I've been seeing a lot of foreign diplomats / officials retweeting the speech of RM at the UN. They were all impressed and moved by his speech. I'm so proud of @BTS_twt for being a great role model and inspiration for their generation. #BTSxUnitedNations #Youth2030pic.twitter.com/hAsQroBLsi
Good morning Seok Jin Kim! And congratulations on your UN speech! It was really moving. You're rightfully proud! Keep those with you, and bring them out every time you want. It's a lifetime pass to get all that you want! You deserved it!! Love you
I know, with this imagine more NZ people getting into BTS and turning into ARMYs = more chances of them coming here ahahahha.. but BTS and their UN appearance and speech as the one being in the news is really great, like this is why we love them and are this well - known ahahah
Agree with you and the experts also agree... it was meant for that speech. RM always the original
(SO deserving) makes me extremely emo when I think about it, it's like I'm a proud mom. After the UN speech so many people finally understood why they had such a huge following, and that it wasn't a 'frenzy of fangirls' loving them only for their dancing & good looks. + #BTS
After watching BTS speech at the UN, I'm here now watching their music videos and US guestings. Haha Next thing I know I'm already an army! Hala! Annyeonghaseyo!

He was very nervous at UN. He tried to behave carefully. Amazed by simultaneous interpretation so he was encouraged to speak Eng well.

After that UN speech that RM gave.... I think that "Speak Yourself" is their new project or related to their future album. And if this is so then I am just some where up in the sky So philosophical... @BTS_twt
Joon gives speech at UN.. Dear @BigHitEnt , I demand a remake of "If I ruled The World" without "If" @BTS_twt #UNGA #Youth2030
Jungkook on RM's UN speech. So heartwarming~ “When I saw his back when he was giving a speech, he seemed huge. He seemed like a giant to me. I felt the pride. RM! You’re smart!” @BTS_twt vlive trans by: JK_Glitters pic.twitter.com/E16q4AhjQX
GUYS! So I shared their UN speech on my Facebook & this local who went to high school w/ me way back when commented this!! Like she's someone I hardly ever talked to but that fact that it moved her like that makes me so proud!! My heart is bursting w/ pride right now! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nPSFoNFvdn
Every magazine want contract to bts (actually not only magazine. lol) but bts to busy give army many content than others n ofc the UN speech. pic.twitter.com/GK1hzEJ0bH
My dad just saw Namjoon's UN speech and was so impressed that now he has a new level of respect for them as a whole. He stans them now and that just makes it so happy. The power of BTS is on another level y'all;)
"He’s right. Nowadays at one point we are afraid of judgement & how people think of us. So we’re trying to fit in & keep hiding ourselves. We keep hiding what we like & our thoughts, we just agree to the general opinion in the society" - Reaction to BTS speech at UN
You did so amazing in the UN speech, in so grateful that I'm an army, that I stan a band who have such a beautiful message
i dont get why, after their involvement with unicef and the un speech some fuckshit white boy had to be like "oh, wasnt bts that group that said the n word :/"
JK VLIVE @BTS_twt When RM was dong his speech at the UN his back looked soo big to JK (meaning JK was really proud of him)
Jungkook really went rapmon Hyung then sighed and corrected himself quickly by saying RM you smart. He is complimenting him on his UN speech. This baby. @BTS_twt
my colleague who isn’t a kpop fan happened to see namjoon’s speech at the UN and she said she was so touched by his speech that she started to find out more about this group called BTS and how they started from zero to where they are now. i’m so moved
#BTS @BTS_twt #TheSocialCelebrity #PCAs Look at him, using all skin colors available for that emoji. I love him for really staying true to the message Namjoon conveyed in his UN speech https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1045500167754055680 …
Did she watched BTS's speech at UN?
just a few days after namjoon’s UN speech and we really have racists armys back at it with calling us niggers and telling us our skin “looks like shit” it’s almost like they don’t listen to bts at all
I just realized that in namjoon's un speech he basically repeated word for word one of the verses from Answer: love myself ugh his mind @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/1crYcmlsfo
People who were unhappy with what Lilly Singh said at BTS's UN speech- I just have to wonder why they feel like having a fandom comprised vastly of crying fangirls somehow makes their fandom sound lesser on inferior. That's not demeaning. Unless you've got internalized misogyny.
After the class today, I listened to some of my friends raving about the UN speech (yes, THAT speech). The magnitude is enormous and it is always an impressive sight to see. Even those who don't follow BTS and K-Pop in general become curious and start finding them likeable.
This is so beautiful! I would love people around me to understand how much they mean to me. Three days ago, when BTS had they UN speech I was crying and smiling at the same time, because of Namjoon's touching words. And my mum told me the worst possible +

my mom watched joon's UN speech ONCE and now she feels the need to bring it up every time i breathe. Like today we were facetiming and i said college is hard n she goes "you saw BTS ! They never gave up! Now life's hard you wanna give up? And you call yourself an ARMY??" pic.twitter.com/2TO6xUPGOp

They are our favorite social artist for a reason. Watch the UN speech. @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs⁠ ⁠
RM you are such a huge inspiration to me especially since that speech you did at UN I am so proud to be Army and all the other members are so amazing too I wish you guys nothing but love and support I hope to one day see you guys in person never give up on your dreams
Imagine not giving aroty to bts after they gave a whole speech at the UN and delivered best selling albums back to back in a single year
bts really snapped with the un speech the whole world is watching them now and everyone is starting to respect them more I'm so happy
@bts_bighit I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I just now listened the speech you gave at the UN and it made me cry, it was so beautiful and it made me realize some things about myself. Your songs have helped me over come so many things and with your LOVE YOURSELF
Kpop is here since the 1990s, and bts were here as one of the global ambasadors of unicef, they rise millions of dollars for antiviolence campaigns. So it was appropriate for them to give a speech in a young people event, which you most likely havent even listened to.
My cousin has officially fallen into the rabbit hole of @BTS_twt .. lmao .. after showing her their UN speech and the idol music video this pass week.. she has been like a zombie .. staying up late to watch all their videos on YouTube.. .. I did good!
Idiot probably hasn't heard of BTS speech at the UN GA
I'm like a proud father seeing BTS guys at the UN speech. JK also got a lot of improvement in English skill. holy smoke !
Yall my sch showed the BTS UN speech im dying
It was hard for me to love myself. I'm not a very outgoing person by any means. I shy away from everyone I don't know. Their music brings me happiness and hope. They've taught me that I can be loved and I can love myself. Especially with RM's UN speech that brought on tears.
Lol me! And also I wanted to let you know I don’t think you did anything bad from your speech at UN to BTS. You were just expressing your feelings. I get that.
All I kept thinking while re-watching @BTS_twt Namjoon's UN speech was that I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up as a skit in the next album, just like their billboard speech #BTSYouth2030 #BTS
ALRIGHT EVERYBODY I WILL FINALLY WATCH THE BTS UN SPEECH
DID I ACTUALLY DO A THING SKSKS SHES DOING THE BTS UN SPEECH FOR GOV IM SHAKING pic.twitter.com/WH7agYlyCz
one of malaysian artist posted about namjoon's speech at the un on his ig and the responses in the comments are mostly positive and some don't look at bts as just ordinary kpop group anymore but they are actual influential. i feel like a proud mom pls :')
BTS’ UN speech is in my University English class website! I was so shocked and happy and excited to see their faces there
#ARMY let’s leave positive comments under unicef Instagram post of #Namjoon #RM #UN speech. Right now there’s people making silly comments. #BTS
BTS has delivered an empowering and inspirational speech at UN for all generations. We - Army - are gonna live it up to our real life. "Listen to yourself. Love youself and Speak yourself." I vote #PCAs #TheSocialCelebrity #BTS @BTS_twt
This is so lovely! And so true! I'm almost 50 and their words speak to me too. Namjoon's UN speech affected me so much. I love them for sharing their voices with me, and for helping me find my own voice. @BTS_twt #IDOL #TheSong #PCAshttps://twitter.com/MariaRo94363630/status/1045509822165049344 …
My brother in law today was like “does BTS speak English?” i was like “yea, one of them does” he was like “yea I guess someone rted a video or speech he made” I was like “yes they spoke at the UN” he was like “yea, that. And I was like bro this muthafucka speaks perfect English!” pic.twitter.com/om6PxoG9rK
YOONGI I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! Congratulations for the UN Speech! You deserve to be there Love! Enjoy the Stadium Concert baby!
i love reading comments from locals about namjoon's speech at the un. "ive never heard the voice of the bts guy but holy shit is that a voice" welcome my lad. welcome
I've rewatched your UN speech multiple times already but it still manages to tug on my heartstrings every single time. Thank you so much for your powerful message Joonie.
With the album Answer and the UN speech, I’m literally learning how to love myself by knowing that flaws are okay; nobodys perfect

Did you show them the UN speech or the social work of BTS and Army...??? or the Love Myself with eng sub??? You can sing it when u are hearing it but sing the lyrics in eng..let them hear the good things that BTS tell you...this work haha
I love how you used different hand colors of emoji. It reflects the speech you've made in the UN. Baby Kookie at the age of 21 made such great impact! Kings!
@the_hindu they haven't gone viral coz of UN speech, They were a sensation & legends & are the most influential people for the youth so they were called upon such prestigious stage to speak up coz they know that what BTS says has a huge impact on us. They world's top boy band!!*
i showed my dad bts’s UN speech and he said i couldn’t have picked a better group to be a fan of :,)
@the_hindu Thank you for covering BTS' UN speech and bringing attention to their message to a wider Indian audience. @BTS_twt have been inspiring youth about self love and they also have a campaign #EndViolence partnered with UNICEF.https://twitter.com/the_hindu/status/1044813859905826816 …
#ARMY please REPORT this video! 12:35min he starts talking about BTS, explaining they dont deserve to be doing a speech in UN because BTS is a product: they dont write or produce music, they dont write their speechs, they are like a puppets, etc link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GidKGANtqxE …pic.twitter.com/EeYO36ohlg

I just showed my mom bts’s speech at the UN and I was so close to tearing up because a bitch is so proud omfg
Mr.Gibson you made a mistake and it is never too late to apologize. Your xenophobic remarks on BTS' UN speech will be forever posted on Twitter, IG, Facebook, Youtube,,, you name it. Just watch it again and hope you can learn from mistakes. #KendisGibsonIsOverParty
bts are a big inspiration to me, especially with the speech at UN, i wanna speak myself and find my voice, a process i’ll work on.
The use of the phrase "speak yourself", to me, is more original and blends well with the entire message spclly so when it was used in a history-making speech before the UNGA. in the future, when pple hear that phrase. RM of BTS , the speech, #GenerationUnlimited will be recalled
my mom’s listening to BTS’ UN speech and she’s making the entire family listen to it cjfjdj
Still crying over namjoon and bts’ un speech haha
anyway i talked about bts’ UN speech on the radio today and how awesome it is that they’re empowering young people abc news who???
I'm only a recent fan of #BTS - I saw them on the Billboard music Awards but I didn't feel the call to stan until I heard Rm's speech this week at the UN. I felt it in my heart and the support from #BTSARMY was amazing. #SpeakYourself
@DancinKim76 And BTS didn't get laughed at after their speech at the UN. They killed it AND got applause. English is their second language and the manage to speak clearly and remain calm, cool and collected. The leader's IQ is 148. I wonder what Trump's is?
This is almost a year ago,one year forward this is same guy who gave a speech at the UN couple days ,and is about to have a stadium concert in NY that sold out in less than 10 min. Mortal of the story,don’t underestimate others. @BTS_twt #PCAs #TheMusicVideo #IDOLpic.twitter.com/9983iWfzyr
Thats comforting Education is the mean, not an end and its comforting the principal feel so too by his act of propagating RM UN speech to his students
[ENG] According to the Korean media, #Namjoon wrote the UN speech based on his experience and his real story. This draft was discussed with BigHit. #BTS #AMAs #FavoriteSocialArtist @BTS_twt
re: "they didn't literally save me" - LOL are they serious? Speaking for myself, only God can save me, not another human. Wonderful & amazing, with oh so angelic voices, @BTS_twt @bts_bighit are still humans (see RM's UN speech & all their songs). You are right re: "comfort"!
Oh, Charming you are so handsome! So very proud of you! Ambassadors of Unicef, Speaking at the UN. Namjoon's compelling speech. You all have given us so much of yourselves. Inspiring us all through your music, devotion, and love. Thank you, Yoongi you!
Hai Namjoon-sii, u know what u'r speech at UN is amazing and i believe that's will be motivated many people who heard it. Thank u for u'r hard work, u'r sincerely, please stay humble as u used to be. Finally step by step u can embrace both RM n Kim Namjoon. I u
RM that was a very heartfelt speech at UN thank you for inspiring the Youth of today keep doing what you guys are doing...inspiring people around the World
BTS @BTS_twt made history at the #UnitedNations this week, becoming the first #Kpop group to deliver a speech at the UN on @UNICEF 's anti-violence campaign & importance of believing in yourself - we'll break down the speech with K-pop columnist @Jeff__Benjamin #SpeakYourselfpic.twitter.com/NK3GrxwOKa
He's learning. I pretty sure he heard ARMYs remarks because since the UN speech he was speaking about BTS like he's a real ARMY. People can learn and grow. He still talks with a kpop agenda at other times, but when it comes to BTS seems like he's learned
Thank you so much for sharing!! I’m a proud Army Umma! This is so encouraging, I’ve been transformed by the positive energy around BTS, especially since the speech at the UN!
OMFG IM IN THE CAR RN ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL AND THE RADIO BROADCASTERS JUST MENTIONED BTS' DOING A SPEECH AT THE UN GUESS WHO'S SCREAMINGGG (btw im from ph)
It's so cool to see so many educators from different countries use @BTS_twt UN speech as part of their teaching. BTS impacting school curriculum~~
Love you!! You guys did great!! I loved the UN speech!! Can’t wait for the concert tomorrow!!

i just found out that a friend of mine for five years recently became a fan of bts bc of their UN speech aaaah my heart is so full
I'm sure this UN #Youth2030 event and Joon's historical speech (representing BTS) was extremely important for all of you. I hope you know that it was immensely significant for ARMYs too, it is a source of pride, motivation and determination for many of us. Thank you, Yoongi.
Yesterday i found out that my boss likes BTS. She randomly found their speech at UN and she went to bed late watching their videos
Omo! this proves na hindi lang puri pagpapa-cute ang kaya nilang gawin. they are a great inspiration to the youth. #BtsUnSpeech https://www.facebook.com/100007467430704/posts/2141623312763229/ …

BTS inspired me to write my dissertation about depression, youth & how music can help one to love themself. It came all at once today during the studio presentations at uni when I thought of RM's speech at the UN conference.. Should I actually write this as my dissertation topic?
your speech at un was so amazing and i haven’t stopped thinking about it bubs
Yoongi!!! You are so cute omg!! You guys did great btw at the UN speech and so proud of you all ^^ i love you so much
Yupp!!!! The UN speech you guys did was a success!!! Thankyou for giving the youth a power to voice their feelings out! Even the elders spoke about themselves too! I encountered many of them! Continue to have impact and make the world a better place thankyou!
i love you so much and i'm so so proud of you for your UN speech and UNICEF initiative i hope you're doing well baby
Those who know me know I don’t like confrontation. Don’t know if it was RM’s UN speech, but today I had to stand up for someone. My hands were shaking & my heart was racing, but I wasn’t going to stay shut. Thanks @BTS_twt for giving me the courage to do that. #SpeakYourself
@BTS_twt has had big plans for us since their debut in 2013 and they're leading millions in the proper direction of change. So the next time someone clowns me for trusting bts so much imma pull Joon's UN speech out and shove it in their face

He basically belittled BTS’ speech in front of the UN General Assembly as nothing more than words from a “boy band from Korea” and when his female co-anchor tried to explain the importance of BTS’ message, he talk down to her and continued demeaning them +
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
So i watched @BTS_twt ‘s UN speech again again and i cant help but say again how proud of them i am. I haven’t been an ARMY for long but I’m glad to be here now. I’m so proud of them. Your faults do not make you stupid or whatever. They make you YOU
As an author who has heard almost all of @BTS_twt @bts_bighit songs, I also think that #RM wrote the UN speech himself. I was glad to hear that @BigHitEnt provided a proofreader to get rid of typos, but it’s beyond obvious that RM wrote it. Expect Cypher 6 & 7 for naysayers.

gosh, this promo week was truly godtier, first the UN speech (not that it was necessarily part of promo but still) is making the rounds on places that bts would have never reached otherwise and now this fortnite challenge has a bunch of gaming vehicles writing about them

So, until yesterday my mom didn't know anything about BTS, this morning I showed her Namjoon's speech at the UN and she fell in love with him. She asked me to tell her more about BTS and here I am, six hours later, showing her BTS videos, choreographies and theories #BTS
Proud of your speech! In fact, MANY people who watched you speak at the UN were impressed
I'm so glad you highlighted this! It was really evident that the hosts understood just how big, important, and influential BTS are. They asked about the UN speech – but also a kind of everyday question (but still very much a breath of fresh air) in how they liked NY. I loved it!
OMG!! BTS at the UN!!!!! The full speech that RM of BTS gave at the United Nations https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y via @YouTube

The power of words. BTS have some of the most incredible minds out there whether it's lyrics or quotes, the boys are full of wisdom, Paticularly evident in Namjoon's speech at the UN. They have knowledge way beyond their years and everyone should learn from them :)

hi RM you did super well in UN speech. i am so proud of you. cant be more proud. i know that you are nervous at that time, but i can definetely guanrantee thay you did super awesome that time!
Where I work there are a lot of people that refuse to buy cable, don't do smart phones (or at least not most apps), & rely on NPR. Nothing wrong, but difficult to explain BTS. But today volunteers came to tell me they heard Namjoon's speech to the UN so proud!! @BTS_twt
Hope you're having fun in NY and i loved your speech at the UN, it was so touching
Hope ya'll/y'all are resting and eating well. Going to keep it real you guys, but ya'll look dead tired. Please rest well between concerts and the UN speech was nice. Would like to know when y'all are coming to the south? *coughs MIAMI*coughs. Y'all have lots of Florida fans

Apparently I used Siri to search BTS and only member I found individually is Kim Nam Joon aka RM I am sure that is the UN speech impact
did you cry when you heard namjoon's un speech for the first time (and the 5625 times after that) I Vote @BTS_twt as the Favorite Social Artist at #AMAs
Korean boy band sensations BTS, give an inspiring speech at UN. Argument: Is it ethical for a boy band to speak at the UN while not being politically involved? #aplacnewshttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …

My mom and sis were casually talking abt @BTS_twt (im proud lol) my sis mentioned she watched BTS concert (maybe she was referring to fancams or BTS guestings at US) then my mom proudly said BTS gave speech at UN omgggg and I wasnt even part of the conversation lmao
I just find it funny that BTS didn't give a single speech at the UN until Trivia: Seesaw was released. Seesaw is a bop that is singlehandedly bringing world peace.

hi i usually don’t talk about BTS because i’ve never really gotten into them (and i don’t wanna come off as pandering to their massive audience) but WOW Namjoon’s speech to the UN gave me chills. what an incredible message.

BTS literally just had a speech in UN. How can they top that. Money is not everything you know. We dont care if they perform their. Congrats then. Moving on. Sigh.
My friend told me J00n's speech at the UN is cringy and I was like, which part is cringy?? He said because he seems like singing. I don't understand him. He got bored in the middle of the speech. It made me sad.
All the media houses addressing Joon-ssi by his real name after UN speech makes my heart warm It's what he deserves All the respect and recognition as Kim NamJoon @BTS_twt #AMAs #AMAsFavoriteSocialArtist
And to THINK We are going to have these videos to watch on youtube or wherever, for posterity at this point Name a future date I'll probably still be watching these TV events and the UN speech, just WATCH ME @BTS_twt I'm so elated and proud sjjffjdjjd

My mother who has never cared at all for bts (although she does respect my interests) has recently been quite interested in them. She has even shared namjoon's UN speech in her own fb acct and has been recently watching their performances.
I srsly cannot stress enough how great the UN speech has been in terms of getting ppl to genuinely see what we fans see in bts and the trust we have in what they stand for as young people, as the former underdogs of the kpop industry who persevered and distrupted the status quo
shut up i just thought what if super star bts put namjoon's un speech as a challenge
because you are the only one who can figure out whether it can work out or not. you shouldn’t let anyone speak for you, so listen to yourself, love yourself, and "speak yourself". ------ reference: UN speech, Kim Namjoon aka RM #BTS #fanart #ARMY #LoveMyself
It's really painful to see that BTS is actually doing something important and the fact that Namjoon just gave a beautiful speech at the UN about the campaign and yet some ppl really can't accept them for who they are

Oooooh I have something to tell y'all omggg, I friend of mine (she's not an army) told me earlier that she watched Namjoon's speech in UN and she told me she loved his accent @BTS_twt
I've been avoiding sharing BTS news with my boyfriend to see what catches his attention. He didn't know about GMA or Fallon but he knew about the UN speech!!

Cover page and article covering their early hardships and hurdles, that RM mentioned in his UN speech, would give not just BTS great exposure, but expose your magazine to an audience who might not follow you yet. BTS isnt just a boy band. They are a movement for the youth

Oh i get it, you need a speech at the UN to be impactful ? I mean are you really comparing bts to these legends ? No they don’t have a speech at the UN, but they’re still more impactful that bts, that was the stupidest thing an army ever said like, stop being delusional.
Such a great cause and exactly what the world needs. RM’s beautiful speech at the UN resonated this kind of support for the youth in our world and I love the idea to increase opportunities and access to knowledge for girls in tech. @BTS_twt #SummitGiveshttps://twitter.com/BTSx50States/status/1045103407734894592 …

I am too cautiously optimistic so much that I’d rather not even speak it Idk if it’s east coast thing, but gma and jimmy were such a contrast to west coast promos. maybe it’s the UN speech or maybe we are being heard for who we are and bts are seen for great artists they are.
stephen colbert should get bts on his show and talk about how their un speech was better than trumps
I listened to RM's speech for UN again and I feel like I always find something new. His speech is so powerful, it brought tears to my eyes. He spoke for all of us who needs love and self confidence. He is truly a great leader not only for bts but me as well. RM Thank You.
@BTS_twt #Namjoon #RM After your UN speech I had the urge to listen to "Change the World" by Eric Clapton. The message is a bit different but it's a great song and I hope you like it! https://youtu.be/x11NA63gLDM
I finally watched Namjoon’s UN speech in its entirety (I haven’t had the time to watch all 6 minutes) and I cried :( Joon’s words really hit home for me, it’s so inspiring and I’m reminded yet again how much I love BTS and what they’ve come to mean to me
BTS at the UN What everyone else got: an inspiring speech about important political points and that you have to self love. What is got: names for my fish when they born
;) UN speech was a huge game changer — not just for BTS, but for anyone who watched it. Namjoon said what everyone alive needs to hear: your name, your voice, your story all matter. Your own self, your self-expression, matters. If that didn’t hit home, you might have no soul.
wow :( holland retweeted bts’ speech at un
my parents just watched bts un speech n they were so impressed n agreed w everything bts said n stands for, i feel so happy :”)

Same also i was blown away by the UN speech i have been staning them since 2016 but never felt this much pleasure in my life am crying like parent lol
I feel that both anchors were mocking BTS. If you listen to it again I heard the female anchor laughing and that she’s implying that RM’s speech is far off from the issues what the UN trying to convey. They were BOTH MOCKING THEM. Her last name is Ramos #abcwnn total disrespect
!!!even if you don’t like kpop and you hate bts....you gotta admit that their UN speech was amazing.... I still don’t get why you don’t like kpop or them but you’re missing out!!!
I would like an apology too but I’m too busy sleeping to watch your show. You’re just a quasi anchor on a show ppl turn on when they can’t fall asleep and you have the gall to belittle BTS’ UN GA speech. What arrogance.
I was just talking with a guy that commented about the UN speech. He was impressed with Joon's eloquent words and smart language. Then I told him he was self-taught he was very impressed, I hope he watches more videos now.

Global superstars BTS performs live on 'GMA' after history-making UN speech on self-acceptance and confidence - ABC News - via @ABC https://gma.abc/2xQNiKU
I didn't realize how much bts has impacted my life until today when my dad called me to ask what the UN speech was about
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
Also. I am in love with BTS ( @bts_bighit ). Specifically RM. ........... ....... ..... ... Gurrrrrllllll. Mm. Listen to "Fake Love". His voice is beyonnnnd sexy on this song. Then his speech at the UN on Monday?! I. AM. IN. LOVE. Real love. https://youtu.be/7C2z4GqqS5E
My dad, watching RM’s speech at the UN: “these guys are not only talented and good at singing, they’re super humble and genuinely good guys” Me: “yeah dad. I know” @BTS_twt
Earlier this week, #BTS became the first Korean artists to address the UN, as leader RM gave an inspirational speech encouraging young people to find their voices. Question of the day: What's the most inspiring advice you've ever been given? pic.twitter.com/9VWlBrSIeu
No doubt that Namjoon wrote the UN speech himself. It's HIS story, referencing @BTS_twt lyrics that HE wrote. It's because he brought up his own story that listeners were able to reflect more on ours. We connect. #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS
I still can't get over this speech, he did amazing! #BTS #KimNamjoon #BTSARMY #UN pic.twitter.com/81oFVeTwXX
And what do you mean people like you are making it easier? What are you doing to help? Have you seen Namjoon’s speech at the UN. Currently, BTS are trying to help people of today’s youth. They’re doing a campaign with UNICEF to protect the youth of today from violence. +
I watched Namjoon’s ( @BTS_twt) UN speech again and when he said “I shut down my own voice & started to listen to the voices of others” I got goosebumps because that’s what I’ve been doing lately. I’ve been so worried about people judging me that I didn’t even think about what+
So... I just checked out K-pop after that #BTS speech at the UN and...and I just want to say I might have to go hetero for BTS... Someone send help, I like being gay.

So my friend's mom likes bts now because of their speech at the UN, she found it so inspirational, and said they were and that their music spreads a good message ( i think her bias is namjoon) and she said good job for buying their album lmao
The awkwardness when BTS speech at the UN was actually more meaningful and made sense for the UN campaign that the rubbish Trump said... but like what my friend said, what’s new

I said he should have told them to watch the UN speech as soon as possible because it's incredible. But he said it would've been weird if he pulled back the curtain, scooted his office chair out and said "You know BTS?" ffkdkskfjf (his desk is right next to the kitchenette lol)
Proud. Most of my friends already know @BTS_twt Because I told them about them. So I always go telling them about their accomplishments. My friend watch with me the UN speech.
why is it that in the course of like,,, one day bts can go from giving a speech at the UN to,,,, to,,,,, a fortnite dance challenge,,,,,,,,
Pockets: People are talking in the kitchenette (at work) about BTS. Me: From Fallon last night or GMA this morning? Pockets: GMA this morning, how RM learned English from Friends, and how they haven't seen the UN speech yet.
guys i just watched @BTS_twt UN Speech and I'm literally crying! Can't wait to see them next week so I can cry some more! pic.twitter.com/Nan4w59RSk
oops it translates to(not that anyone is really gonna care) “did you see that your boyfriends gave a speech at the UN?”. he likes calling bts my boyfriends hhh.

NamJoon, you were awesome speaking at the UN! Sincere, open, and honest—your speech inspired me to live up to your plea for each of us to be ‘real’ to ourself and others and to “speak” our personal truth. I’m so proud of BTS!

So I was browsing my Facebook when I saw the interview of BTS in Jimmy Fallon and I am so upset by the amount of xenophobic and malicious comments I see. what’s worse is these comments are from grown ass adults. oh, Don’t get me started on the videos of RM’s UN Speech... pic.twitter.com/YqJnwaLjQd
When my mom suddenly said "Oh i have something to show you.." then she gave her phone to me "BTS was on the UN, I ask my co-worker to send me this" *twt of bts speech on UN* all i said was "i know ma, i know. Their speech was rlly awesome"
"Stop asking permission to be who you are" -99.5 I am so happy they talked about BTS on the radio here in the Philippines. They talked about their UN speech and their message and how genuine and passionate @BTS_twt is.
seeing you guys standing on the stage of UN and delivering an inspiring speech... having a dance party with Jimmy Fallon... appearing on GMA... the best week of my life ~ I'm so proud of you. Congrats, 방탄소년단 2018 is the year of @BTS_twt Favorite Social Artist #AMAs

i’m so mad my brother was degrading bts by making fun of their un speech and calling them plastic surgery dolls I HATE HIM
After #RM UN speech I can tell how positively it effected him,to remind himself why he created music,why he launched the #loveyourself Campaign,their responsibility.

i told my coworker who listened to namjoon’s speech at the UN that namjoon’s a genius and he’s my favorite artist. and in response, she said she REALLY adored the speech and that they are all SO adorable (this woman’s around my mom’s age). basically i love bts going mainstream.

@BTS_twt thank you for your speech at the UN and thank you RM for delivering it so well. Your speech made my day better because it gave me hope. Hope to not only continue despite obstacles but to believe in who you are and speak yourself.
bts is really that group going viral because of an un speech like, only bts could do this

@abcWNN I'm not trying to be disrespectful here, but what you said about @BTS_twt is absolutely unprofessional. Their speech at the UN was a big dream for our Boys and talking down to them, just because they are Korean is just pitiful. The Leader Kim Namjoon has an IQ of 148 so +
Just watch Namjoon's speech at UN. He is so eloquent and such a beautiful person. I am so proud of him and BTS

i deadass just saw a tweet saying “bts are anti blacks” like namjoon didn’t say “no matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour” with his whole chest during his UN speech
This is why ARMY supports them as much as we do. Their message, through music, resonates with so many of us and is a deep meaningful message. We hope more people will take the time, after hearing their speech, to listen to their music and hear their message and support it.

It's understandable that RM was nervous. It was not a Daesang speech for MAMA. It was a UN General Assembly, a very important and highly respectable assembly.

Like the UN Speech, why do we have to label it as "1st Kpop", yes, it is true, but can we just give the honor to BTS (or to whoever will have the chance to do that) as who they are? and what contributions they gave to the society? Not because they are KPOP.

Look. SNSD is great. They really are. But whether they’ve accomplished what BTS has isn’t even debatable. Where are SNSDs certified gold songs? Where’s their Billboard hits with Korean lyrics? Where’s their UN speech? They simply havent done everything BTS has.
And CBS wrongly reported that they "performed" at UN. They only delivered a 7 minute speech, UN is no concert arena.
I work in a library and have been torn between adding @BTS_twt CDs to our collection because I was worried it would hinder sales.

imo i guess bts already has more impact than 1/d like just the fact that they held a speech at the UN..
I sailed with the BTS boat just before RM gave a speech at the UN and I can't be more happy/proud for him and for the band. They really are trying to spread a good message, and the message it's being heard all around the world
Dear @GMA I don't understand why you chose to belittle @BTS_twt.I'm 39. RM's speech at the UN told people to love themselves no matter their skin color or gender identity. Does their ability to dance or their country of origin that make that not what we want in a role model?
I already did my research. They did some problematic things but apologized. Not only did they apologized, they improved themselves. You should listen to “change” by RM and Wale and BTS’s UN speech. You think I don’t care,I’m black too,why do you think they have so many black fans

bts on jimmy fallon is easily their best us tv show appearance/interview and prob the only one I liked lol. they had fun and he actually asked questions about their un speech instead of basic shit about their fans or if they're dating
“BTS make their US morning television debut” /very cool chaps. LOVE the outfits and their moves. and the UN speech, are they cool or what??

I'm really so proud of BTS and what they're achieving day by day, they truly deserve all that's good in this world ♡ i keep seeing NJ's speech at UN and my heart melts and i feel SO proud of the man he is. I'm so happy to know someone like him, like each one of the boys ♡
Guess what army ? My english teacher asked me to bring him the speech of namjoon in the un and told me he may use it as exam topic i'm proud I vote @BTS_twt as Favorite Social Artist for #AMAS

The comments under the main tweet are making me sad. I keep thinking back to Namjoonie's UN speech. If they won't help youth, then step aside and let youth (and youth of heart of course) help youth instead. Let's get it ARMYs! #SummitGives #BTS @BTS_twt @OneInAnARMY @BTSx50States
the essay was about how adversity and our hard ships shape us into who we are and i said “in his speech at the UN, Namjoon talks about how his mistakes are what motivated him to get better and has allowed BTS to amass the large audience they have today”
Wow BTS’s impact. Right after that UN speech, NY lawmakers went to work. Say thank you BTS. https://twitter.com/DaveVescio/status/1044425297192341504 …

I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
They performed on America's got talent, had an interview at the grammy museum, were on Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and #BTSonGMA but I think the most proud are we and the boys themselves for their inspirational and empowering UN speech! @BTS_twt #BTS
Most the people coming for bts’ UN speech aint even doing a thing to solve world issues but commenting hearts on posts that say “1 = 1 Respect ”
MY TEACHER JUST ACKNOWLEDGED BTS UN SPEECH AND SAID IT WAS IMPACTFULJCKSKSKS cmon Legend! Hey army
Okay so I finally could catch up with #BTSonGMA ! I COULDN’T EVEN BE MORE PROUD OF BANGTAN RN and I’m so glad that @GMA as @jimmyfallon pointed out their speech at the UN and talk about #SpeakYourself . MY HEART IS FULL OF PRIDE @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/DLIpVo9FZ4

*very BTS is the ambassador of UNICEF. They have a campain called “Love Yourself” to help end violence & it raised millions of money. 3% of their profit goes to UNICEF, that’s why UNICEF invited them to have a speech in the UN. Plus the theme of that day is about Youth.
I mean good on the interviewers for giving BTS and ARMY the respect we all deserve but also, I don’t want to discredit how impactful their speech and presence at the UN was. I think it showed the world what ARMY has already knew, that they give us a voice to inspire our truth.
Okay, can I just say I'm so proud of BTS right now? Speaking at the UN, performing on Jimmy Fallon, GMA? Like WOW I'm completely speechless and let me say that Namjoon's speech was really moving
Namjoon you did great at the UN!!! I'm so happy and proud of you :'D your speech was just amazing!!!

Reminder that BTS didn't need money and a big company to make a speech at UN as representatives of youth. All it takes is talent. Talent talks. BTS has ALOT of talent, they can and will totally dominate the world while its good. BTS are extremely talented i see why ppl r pressed
BTS is UNICEF’s ambassador. UNICEF invited them to make a speech in the UN. Instead of being ignorant, why not try to search on why they were invited in the UN first.
BTS's speech at UN conference was lit.
So the US isn't *really* covering most of the Korean news rn, I hope y'all AT LEAST watch the full BTS speech fr the UN. Not a big #Kpop fan, but I love what's happening here. If you don't tear up a little, you have no heart. https://youtu.be/ZhJ-LAQ6e_Y #KoreanRepresentation

BTS is collaborating with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). During their SPEECH at the UN yesterday they spoke about MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE for TEENS and CHILDREN, NOT about KPOP. They’re not JUST performers, they’re advocates. #BTSUnitedNations
So I just made a new friend, the guy blasted boy in luv next to me and i tell you, i yelled LITERALLY. We even started talking about @BTS_twt speech at the UN and ordering jackets. I'm happy now :)

did my mom just sent me a BTS video but not just any ordinary video but RM's speech during UN??? you betcha
Speaking of RM doing his speech in UN, I believe some ARMYs haven't listened to this masterpiece. PLEASE DO. "I believe one day my voice will be spread. " And I BELIEVE, RM's voice has been heard. @BTS_twt @bts_bighit #BTSxUnitedNations @UN #BTSArmyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEAS7UVocsc …

My mom always watches BTS’ interviews with me and pretty much records them for me as well. After the Fallon show, she complimented their suits. She’s also complimented their English during the bbmas. And she really enjoyed Joonie’s speech at the UN.
I kid you not, one of my friend is so incredibly biased against Kpop and by extension BTS that she obviously found a way to criticize the Fallon interview and the UN speech...I-I give up
Folks! ARMYs, CNN instagram post about BTS' UN speech is riddled with xenophobic and narrow-minded comments, please help making the positive responses become top comment. https://www.instagram.com/p/BoIzk4PA5LS/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=13cwu1olwn6f3 …
did bts just give a un speech, performed two songs on fallon and went on to perform on gma in a matter of two days??? these dedicated men i swear

I think that Robin and Michael were just so kind and welcoming to @BTS_twt. They appreciated Joon’s speech an UN, they appreciated the positive message that bts were trying to spread, they appreciated their music, and most of all, they appreciated them as people.

i'm so glad we're past that awkward US interviews phase. BTS are a big deal now that interviewers actually do their research and end up falling in love with them and their message. and the UN speech helped immensely. 2017 was painful when it came to US interviews.
I love you so so so so much, Nam!!! you were amazing at the UN, your speech was the most beautiful one I've ever heard
I don’t know if I’m disappointed in Jezebel for not bothering to cover the BTS UN speech or relieved cause fuck their shitty commentors.
watch the whole thing, see her doing her mc job, and listen to her speech. She's a well known comedian/public figure who also shares the same views and aspirations for ppl- just like BTS. Be civil and talk more abt the topics discussed in the UN meeting, then that one statement-
Loved the show! They were not only so comfortable on stage and had so much fun, but they were also able to talk about the UN speech and perform with amazing mics and camerawork @BTS_twt #BTSonFallonhttps://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/1044922202506887168 …

bts' trip to america this time around was the most iconic trip so far not only did they get invited to the grammy museum and get interviewed but also gave a speech at the UN and performed in times square.
Hi! I know I am late, but thank you so much for the speech you said at the UN. I have no other way to show my gratitude other than trying to accept myself for who I am and all my flaws. @BTS_twt

So someone at work today brought up Namjoons UN speech because they know how much I love BTS and they were amazed at how passionately I talked about them and I even started to cry because I’ll be seeing them this weekend. She said their message is beautiful and she likes them.
im crying so many people shared bts' un speech and started liking and supporting them this is it this is how they save the world
I’ve already had about 3 people I know, tell me they’ve listened to the UN speech and BTS’ music and come to understand why we love them so much and that their music and dancing is so good. People are understanding instead of judging, I’m going to cry #BTS #SPEAKYOURSELF @BTS_twt

We know there are racist/mean tweets when it comes to some folks who are ignorant about bts. But i'm starting to see a bit fewer of them ever since Joon's UN speech. Most of them are impressed and respect bts so much more and starting to see them more than a "boyband"
Jimmy asking bts about their message? Mentioning their speech at the UN? Not cutting to the audience a single time during their performance? Good Content. #BTSonFallon #BTS
Joon you did such a wonderful job! It was a remarkable speech and I am so proud of both you and BTS. Y’all are doing so much and it warms my heart that you got to speak at the UN. Keep fighting and going strong! Y’all are doing great and thanks for all the hard work pic.twitter.com/a2djion60Y

theyre doing their best spreading awareness on important issues , im not an army but seeing rm give his speech at the UN has filled me with pride and joy as ive seen bts grow since 2016

Love you joonie. Your UN speech was really great. You did more than okay. It was inspiring.
Kim Namjoon who addressed speech in UN had represented a positive image and encourage young generation to speak out themselves. An professional anchor should not appear any insulting attitude while reporting. Apology required. @abcWNN @kendisgibson @ABC #BTS https://twitter.com/GoAwayWithJae/status/1044696335201566720 …
@BTS_twt Namjoon, your speech in UN hit me.I cried over. Your speech, You, Yourself inspires me a lot more.I've been struggling loving myself and yet you spoke the right words i needed and thats the key. Thank you so much for being an inspiration to us,to the world. Ilysm, joonie
It is amazing that Joon's speech at UN is still trending #27 in US How often do you have same group trending for a meme dance challenge and an uplifting speech in front of world leaders? This is @BTS_twt for you right there https://youtu.be/C8HalPx1RJY
I have so much thoughts after listening to your UN speech. I hope you know that I deeply want to thank you for everything you have done to my life. It is beyond words and i wish I could tell them all..for now, really really thank you @BTS_twt i love you
I went on Facebook and some one shared @BTS_twt UN speech and I’m crying again
this is a result of so many things combined. their work in the song/album, the fandom work promoting, the UN amazing speech, Fallon crackheaded appearance, GMA sweet words about them... I'm happy for the new fans arriving

That UN speech did wonders but the icing on the cake was the mention of this speech on The Tonight show and GMA. Chances of ppl going to check it out after these interviews is higher.
@jimmyfallon and @GMA were so welcoming towards BTS. You could really tell how comfortable they were. It was also great to see them ask about their UN speech, and the meaning behind their album, instead of just mentioning their social media following.
BICXHHSHSB MY SISTER JUST SAID THAT BTS WAS GREAT ON FALLON AND HOW SHE LIKED THE SPEECH AT THE UN XBSBS I AM SOBBING SHE WAS ALWAYS SO INDIFFERENT TOWARDS THEM SHE WOULD NEVER LISTEN NO MATTER HOW MUCH I ASKED
What a time to be alive. I saw @BTS_twt in person with my own two eyes less than a week ago, then Namjoon delivers a powerful & inspirational speech at the UN (!!), they appear on Fallon last night & GMA today!! Now LY Answer is skyrocketing up the iTunes chart! #BTSonGMA
The speech Our Namjoonie Made @UN touched every corner of my heart . Such talented fine young men and still as humble as ever. They are all younger to me but they have taught me so much about life. Proud really is an understatement ! You guys deserve the world @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/ituDpRvCbb
Is it matter? This post is just about their speech in UN. If you don't trust Koreans that is your choice. But you should know that 7 mens are better than your life. Love yourself.
After how many months and even after Joon's speech at the UN General Assembly, this tweet still sends @BTS_twt
Not @at how a friend(?) and his kaypoppie friends(?) threw shade at namjoon's speech at the UN I get they were joking but literally NO army even dared to make jokes abt a serious speech & water it down. Tom foolery! Why cant people EVER take BTS seriously?
Love u oppa and your awesome fantastic incredible speech on UN
Besides how amazing their performances were, I was most impressed with the fact that both interviews mentioned their speech at the UN! I love that journalists are recognizing them for their talent AND their activism!

Hi @khanacademy you have no idea how many times you saved me in pre-nursing school with A&P, Microbilogy & Chemistry! Thank you for recognizing @BTS_twt speech! They are an inspiration to not only youths but people of all ages around the world! Thx again!
I'm so stoked that NDTV actually wrote an article on BTS explaining about the boys and RM's speech in UN and how others can learn from their speech!! Their impact is growing...and is definitely positive in its every aspect! @BTS_twt @ndtv @BangtanINDIA @bangtan_india @BigHitEntpic.twitter.com/8szcfbVswV
Uuuuuwwwww you wanted to be a superhero and now you did i'm so proud of you!! Congrats for your achievement too speech in UN!
You did an amazing speech at the UN! @BTS_twt
Joon saying that holding his speech at the UN was the best moment of his life is so precious and I know that it's because it's not about him but about all the people that he reaches through his music, because he followed his dreams and through it, shares this message @BTS_twt
Smh I’m about to cut a bitch, my friend was just making fun of the way #BTS speak English and was making fun of Joon UN speech. Someone hold me back
Hello ARMYs! Today we decided to create special appreciation thread, dedicated to @BTS_twt and their speech at UN. Speech that #Namjoon had really touched so many people that is why I wanted to share few tweets I found with you. #ComplimentBTS #BTSxUN #BTS pic.twitter.com/XN1sCer4OF
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak?a [ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy”
On Mon they gave a speech in UN General Assembly for a youth program called Generation Unlimited. I urge u to listen to what RM, the leader of the group, has to say. They wrote the speech using references from their lyrics, which was written by themselves. https://youtu.be/XXCqBotaGRI

Youre speech at the UN was so so inspiring and made my heart happy
To all the young ARMY: You might have one of the most important jobs in the fandom rn. #BTS called you to action. To use your voice. Ask your parents to help you participate in your community. Whether that's criticizing bad journalism or discussing a UN speech... ++
You guys did it so well at the UN. Namjoon we are also so proud of you and your incredible speech. It will be reminded forever to the whole world. In general this year is so amazing for our Bangtan and us. You guys are history makers. Be proud of you #BTSonGMA @BTS_twt
Namjoonie you did great, I'm so proud of you Your beautiful and powerful speech at UN has moved us and many people around the world, love you so much

Just my personal opinion, BTS got a lot of respect after RM's speech on UN's general assembly. I mean bigger than before. Because they did great. I am literally crying. They deserve respect. Not just because of looks nor talent but because they do their part as humans #BTSonGMA
That UN speech was a game changer. Lots of influential people tweeted about it ,even ceo from Unilever etc . We got a lot of shoutouts from people we dont usually encounter from their music gigs @BTS_twt
I’ve watched Joon’s UN speech seven times so far and each time I couldn’t hold back my tears. @BTS_twt thank you for the beautiful message
#BTS I think #kimnamjoon should give our president some classes on how to give a speech at the UN assembly
NICE TRY but @kendisgibson and the other anchor was disrespectful when the news about BTS Namjoon UN speech was broadcasted
I'm sooooooooo proud of this amazing young man, RM, you have no idea, & I'm sure he wrote his @UN speech himself, that's how much he's good with words #BTSonGMA #BTS @BTS_twt

Chris, perhaps you can watch the speech by RM made at the #UNGA UN about 2 days ago for their UNICEF campaign and it can shed some light to you as to why #BTS is loved by many :) #BTSonGMA @jimmyfallon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTe4f-bBEKg …
@BTS_twt your performance this morning on Good Morning America brightened my day. I woke up not feeling well and felt better after watching it. The speech RM gave at the UN made me cry. Although, he gave it remarkably well for being nervous. Continue making Army's lives bright.
My amazing man(oh, no... u r still my 'boy') our lovely, intellectual President Kim Namjoon Thank You very much! For ur truly beautiful, really inspiring speech @UN That was so deep yet it easily find its way & touched my heart & actually touched a lot of livesiloveu
I'm proud of you, we are all proud of you and 'm proud of myself thankyou Namjoon, your sincerely speech at UN has become my motivation for me
one of the most popular arabic news channels, Al Arabiya, reported about BTS' UN speech. My mom just told me about it lol.
joonie thank you for existing you made us so proud with your speech at the UN and for being a core part of your western promotions. I can’t imagine the stress you’re under but you always prevail and do your absolute best. there’s nothing I’m more happier and proud of
BTS Gives a UN Speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KmMsERsKBs …
one thing that makes me really happy is interviewers ask them about their speech in un and acknowledge how much they helped youth and people to speak up about who they are is beautiful bc it means they know bts are not just another boyband
After BTS’s speech at the UN, all I see are horrible remarks towards them. Like just say you’re xenophobic and leave. We don’t have time for your bullshit.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
I cried hard while I’m was watching your speech at UN I felt like I did everything wrong & nobody is with me at all but you are with me right??I still breathe,struggle & live just bc a little hope that I can meet you & just bc of my love on you!I love you so I live Joon @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1044951807091503106 …
so i shared their un speech again on fb and explained how much bts means to me. if anyone’s gonna clown me bc i stan a ‘kpop group’, inwont claim them
Namjoon you actually deserve the entire world! Your UN speech was truly and inspiration for many of us and i really wanna congratulate you and all of bts for being the amazing people you are
What a mood. I don't usually use or post stuff on FB much. But had to go mention and share his UN speech haha.
I love you. My dad loved your speech! He doesnt listen to BTS, but when he saw you guys on the UN, he got all excited and said you are an amazing person. Thanks for inspiring me always.
You did very well on your UN speech Mr. President Kim Namjoon. We're proud of you #TheGroup #BTS #PCAs @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NNoUNs9FuF

after UN namjoon's speech america is starting to see that we don't like bts because they look cute and im proud of that
Just re-watched everything on the @FallonTonight thank you so much once again @jimmyfallon or should I say Chimmy Fallon? ? For having BTS on your show. On of the best appearances of @BTS_twt on US TV. A great interview highlighting their UN speech,the message+ #BTSonFallon
So much is evolving. That UN speech gave our already loud convictions and beliefs validation. Made people reflect that our voices carry meaning and precise intent. The BTSxARMY teamwork that we proudly call movement is leaping forward. And I'm inspired to carry on @BTS_twt
prime example of someone using BTS for clout. He also said some rude things about RM’s UN speech. The fact that you accuse me of not being a real army because i am concerned is disrespectful and i won’t stand for it pic.twitter.com/mHda0DtYlj
I'm fucking crying joon keeps saying how nervous he was and how his hand was shaking while giving his UN speech and how he practiced it like 1000 times he even tried to imagine it YOU DID GREAT NAMJOON. YOU DID GREAT HONEY. YOU'RE AMAZING. WE'RE PROUD OF YOU #BTSonGMA @BTS_twt
Extremely disappointed by this report. Army, if you read this, don't click on it. The headline is appealing, sure, but in a report about BTS empowering and inspiring speech on the UN they decided to include unrelated cliches like plastic surgery, suic*de and fake streams.

baby you did such a good job! i know you was too nervous but it didn’t stop you do go and do what you had to. your speech was so meaningful and beautiful i’ll keep your words with me. love you, hope you had fun at UN, at the tonight show and also in GMA.

Hi Joon~~~ Thank you for your hardwork at the UN. Beautiful speech, btw. And you guys look really good in suit.
It’s really crazy from having gone to secretly liking BTS and no one knowing them publicly two years ago to watching them on Good Morning America and them being praised for their massive fanbase and accomplishments like the UN speech
Your speech at the un was beautiful baby..you were amazing. Thank you for everything. I love you
It's okay ~~~ no worries, thank you for your amazing and emotional speech at the UN T_T it still hits me, I mean, I still can't get over how your speech impacted my whole being, thank you !! always take care too !!!

Thank you for a very inspiring and powerful speech at the UN. Proud is an understatement.
I think a lot about the boys parents and god they must be so proud ! Imagine how Namjoon's parents felt when they saw their son giving a speech at the UN and becoming ambassador.
Listen Mr Kim Namjoon, your speech at UN was not Okay... it was beautiful and amazing and all the adjectives that can describe how inspiring it was. Don't u ever ever doubt yourself cuz you're doing very fine. Keep going. we love and purple u

Hi namjoon. I'm sure you still got those euphorias from your speech that you did yesterday at the UN. I hope that you'll always keep this mindset to always make musics for healing the world, especially youth community in the future. You sir earned my respect!
Hi Joon you did a very amazing speech on UN all of you inspire alot of people
Our nonending battle & movement against prejudice towards BTS is finally bearing fruit. Being untruthfully depicted by media and/or disrespected & belittled is an ongoing issue, but that UN speech, @BTS_twt's genuineness, their emotional & social awareness changed something.+
NAMJOON JOON YOUR SPEECH IN UN IS THE BEST THING. I CRIED SO MUCH THEN AND I STILL CRY WHENEVER I HEAR IT. ITS SO BRILLIANT SO WOW JOON I LOVE YOU WE ALL LOVE YOU SO MUCH JOON. YOU MAKE US SO PROUD. YOURE THE BEST EVERYTHING AND IN EVERYTHING pic.twitter.com/xjNuQyZChR

BTS: hey look at this amazing speech we did at the UN ARMYS: SHHHH NOT NOW WE’RE GONNA TALK SHIT ABOUT BIGBANG.
Only you can turn a UN summit speech into a literary reading and still be more relevant than actual politician's speeches. It was really moving #SpeakYourself
namjoon just wanna say that what you did in un was amazing and that you did great with the speech. it touched everyone and left a mark in their hearts. you made everyone do what we all deemed as impossible. you’re one of the reasons why we are learning to love ourselves more. ily
You make me so proud your speech at the UN meeting was incredible you’re such a powerful individual and i’m glad you and the rest of bts are using your platform to spread such positive messages

We're finally here. I feel it - they've finally launched in America in a way we've wanted them for real. I feel like I can relax now and reach back out again to all my RL friends who rejected BTS and laughed at me. Take THAT America! UN speech or DMA? It's all yours!

Idk how to say but so many things that happen and its all about BTS. I still not over with RM speech at UN and now Jimmy Fallon and GMA. Let me breath
About time. Joon’s UN speech brings a big breakthrough for wider audiences to appreciate more of BTS and their music. This is what we’ve been waiting for and i hope there’ll be more great opportunities like this to come in the future for the boys.
K media said @BTS_twt took over Good Morning America by ABC, US TV. They showed IDOL live stage & talked about the speech at UN, RM said he was nervous at that time.

BTS is doing so well, they even did a speech at the UN. I’m so friggin proud.
Im happy UN Assembly happened before Jimmy Fallon and GMA.. cus they seriously emphasized abt BTS speech on UN and how much their musics contribute towards such acts..
Let's be real here: that UN speech did WONDERS to BTS in terms of credibility. NOW people are more and more actually talking about their MESSAGE rather than anything else. I'm SO proud of it all #BTSonGMA @BTS_twt
this week is going so well so far i haven't felt this good and motivated in weeks ✓BTS on their speech at the UN General Assembly ✓Benedict Cumberbatch on Ellen show ✓BTS on Jimmy Fallon ✓BTS on Good Morning America #BTS #BTSonFallon #BTSonGMA #BTSxUnitedNations
@BTS_twt doing history every day. Yesterday, it was that iconic UN speech that still brings tears to my eyes. Today, they perform in Times Square and spread their message even more. I can't be more proud #BTSonGMA
Lmao I love how everyone was getting cranky abt the long wait & constant commercial breaks for GMA but are now so happy at how well their introduction accurately summarized BTS & what they stand for, their impact, the UN speech, etc perhaps other tv/news shows can learn from GMA
What happened at the UN based on what I’ve seen, a summary: BTS: *Gives eloquent speech and empowers young people* Trump: “let’s make the world hate me and laugh at me bc I’m stupid and not at all a politician”
Bahaha so many coworkers telling me did you know BTS was on GMA! They said they did a speech at the UN and I’m like YES I KNOW
for all the xenophobes out there mocking bts's UN speech *cough* @/kendisgibson "its a boyband from korea." "they've got choreographed dance moves" and uve got a script to read off i wouldnt be so brave if i were u. just bcuz theyre korean doesnt mean they cant help the world. pic.twitter.com/asLeZdrLsO
thank you for the talking about @BTS_twt speech in UN because it's really important to let their voices be heard
Amazing speech it was ok u r really nervous all that matter was u spoke your heart.
bts really missed the golden opportunity to use "show yourself" as the key message in their UN speech in addition to "speak yourself" bcs then they could proceed to follow up on the campaign with "so show me~ (i'll show you~!)" man that'd be perfect and ofc NOT during the speech

someone just came up to me and asked if bts gave a speech at the un because they saw it on instagram. They said they watched the whole thing and really enjoyed it. I didn’t fully realize the impact this speech would carry.
Global superstars BTS perform live on ‘GMA’ after history-making UN speech on self-acceptance and confidence http://www.lifestyle-luxury24.com/?p=20057 pic.twitter.com/8q5Oe22Ep3
2018 is really bts’ year, after the UN speech, Fallon and Gma now the whole world is loving them, they got to show the world how humble, beautiful, kind, hardworking and talented they are and I’m really glad the locals are whipped for them
Irrelevant..because most love them because of their music... especially the band BTS..their message of loving oneself has made them give a speech 2 days back in UNICEF UN..ppl look into them & their target audience isn't just going women for their looks

@abcWNN I would like to point out Kendis Gibson's unprofessional remark about BTS giving a speech at the UN. His statements and behavior exuded sarcasm, labeling BTS as mere "a bunch of boyband from Korea", "they have choreographed dance moves."

Yes me too.I been holding my tears since yesterday, since Joon did that speech at UN.I discovered them in 2013 but I'm starting supporting them in 2015 too, imagine they will be in this level is truly insane.This journey is full of tears,sad tears happy tears and proud tears
Was stalking crush and came across Namjoon's speech at the UN and rewatched the speech again. Yes, that's why he is my crush. We're soulmates. We both like BTS like a lot since debut yeap I that's why both of us can connect like a lot.
#BTSonGMA was the best way to start off my day(‘: from having them talk about their UN speech and what it’s all about, to their amazing performance and their cute interaction with fans especially those two little kids I’m so happy right now! @BTS_twt @GMA
@BTS_twt And Joon...Yes you're obviously nervous at the UN speech, Your hands are shaking and your breath was deep, As if you're lacking air hehehe...But you know.. you still deliver it clearly, with sincerity and exuberance..
Ok, time to promote! Show the Dance Challenge video to kids. Talk about BTS’s UN speech to coworkers. Drop links to Idol performances in public. Let’s bring her back team! [ #TheGroup #BTS  #PCAs]pic.twitter.com/cylj0iYvtt

YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME HAPPIER? THE PUBLIC IS FINALLY TALKING ABOUT BTS' MESSAGE AFTER HEARING NAMJOON'S SPEECH AT THE UN. THEY'RE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT BTS IS MORE THAN THAT "SOCIAL ARTIST" LABEL. THEY'RE FINALLY BEING HEARD AFTER ALL THIS TIME. @BTS_twt #BTS #BTSonGMA

My mom replied when I tagged them to @BTS_twt UN speech. "His message hit me directly in the heart. To be honest, I cried hahaha.

Watching this in one go BTS UN speech BTS on Fallon BTS on GMA Left me —- pic.twitter.com/t9Gmy3OsSl
They're The Biggest Boyband in the Planet but they continue to act so humbly, as if they couldn't believe it and Nam saying that the speech in UN was the best moment of his life shows the kind of people they are, I feel infinitely proud, I purple you babies #BTSonGMA @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/haAEvYUeE0
In less than 48 hours, we cried during Namjoon’s speech in UN, we laugh during their appearance in FALLON and watch the entire GMA show and don’t forget the commercials in every 10 minutes just to watch BTS. Who would of thought this would happen #BTSonGMA
as i said a bit ago, i'll be forever grateful that the UN speech happened, because it gave them exposure of a bigger scale, the gpis waking up, they're seeing the positive impact BTS have, they're perceiving BTS' message and their real intentions. the stereotypes will fade
Another outstanding performance that showcased @BTS_twt’s important message, incredible talent, & lovable personalities. Between this, the UN speech, & Fallon, my army pride & heart can’t get much bigger. Our boys are sitting on top of the world, where they belong #BTSonGMASpic.twitter.com/ECIaSWeXgG
the UN speech was the turning point for BTS, them representing Unicef at such an important event showed the gp who BTS really are and what they stand for. this is seriously getting them real recognition for their intentions and artistry
You know, the boys are achieving so much lately, all the awards, UN speech, talk shows etc. For me, their biggest accomplishment has been uniting so many people. I've been given a family, a place where I feel loved as have many others, thank you #BTS #BTSonGMA @BTS_twt

The UN event rlly gave bts the right attention they deserve im so glad they gave this opportunity the fact joon's speech made these ppl open-eyed of what theyre missing on this grp talking abt real societal issues, deep & encouraging messages thru their songs is alr worth to Stan
And i really surprised that i really watched and listen when they showed the Kavanaugh Case, and brought up the 4 teens to do a Supreme court showdown.. and this really related to RM s Speech at UN @BTS_twt @GMA
After that UN speech... everything is finally coming together and BTS is REALLY taking America by storm, getting asked important questions and given only the best production and camera work. I couldn’t be more satisfied. #BTSonGMA
Your performance was amazing as always and once again your @UN speech was talked about again !! You are changing lives, BTS. You are the voice of our generation. I couldn't be more proud to be on this journey of finding my voice with you @BTS_twt #BTSonGMA pic.twitter.com/aoUA24y6jB

He was great. To give a whole speech in English for over 5 minutes to a room full of foreign delegates at the UN headquarters, when English isn't even his first language! And he's self taught. Kim Namjoon is an inspiration.

the fact that people still refuse to take bts seriously and accept that they’re more than just ‘kpop boys who wear makeup and prance around’ even after namjoon’s speech at the fucking UN, is literally proof that they’re just unreasonably biased and nothing will change their minds

NAMJOON SAID HIS SPEECH AT THE UN WAS THE BEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE. YOU DID VERY WELL BABE!!!! @BTS_twt #BTSOnGMA

Hello, my name is Pearl Issarasena. I am a 14 year old girl from Thailand, Bangkok and currently I am currently learning at Ekkamai International School. Right now and then, I am speaking about myself, because of BTS’s speech in the UN. @BTS_twt
type of childish, playground rubbish the entire time and STILL they have carried on and HAVE now gained the RECOGNITION they deserve. As for the UN speech They were asked to do it by UNICEF because they are involved heavily with charity for children. Again how many young bands do

I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/9KmMsERsKBs?a BTS Gives a UN Speech
Ohhh! You didn't actually LISTEN did ya? 'cuz all I see in your reply is shit about BTS apologizing for not beating T. Swift. Hmmm... Last time I checked, RM's speech was about Youth Empowerment and not all the shit you were talking about. Has Taylor even spoken to UN before?
"ARMYs appreciate their music and their POSITIVE MESSAGE" Music to my ears, that UN Speech truly took them on another level and I couldn't be happier that their message is being acknowledged. @BTS_twt #BTSonGMA
Can't wait to see @BTS_twt burn the stage yet once again..I am tweeting from Abu Dhabi...where my arab ARMYs at..hope the show goes great... @BTS_twt the uae needs uuuuuu .. the un speech was one of a kind president joon #BTSonGMA
Let’s keep it going! NYC says good morning BTS! who will be on GMA Soon!!

i'm not a huge fan of BTS but their UN speech really moved me. the IMPACT. We lose ourselves in the opinions of others. We try to fit into molds to feel belonged. It's time to change that. Maybe the first step to regain the real me is to love myself. Thank you, BTS!!
I was so surprised by the disrespectful and racist comments from your anchor @kendisgibson made towards BTS, who acted as ambassador of #UNICEF to giving motivating speech to youths in the UN meeting. Pls review of our complaints seriously and an apology is what we ask for
They introduced bts, explained some of their achievements, their fanbase, and then went about Namjoon's UN speech, all in a very neutral leaning towards positive way + (gimme a minute to translate as accurately as possible i dont want misinformation to spread)
bts went to the us to go on a world tour, but then went to give a speech at the UN GA, went to Jimmy Fallon, and now to Good Morning America? bts is really making america its bitch
I'm late but I have just watched and listened to BTS speech at UN and I'm just speechless. They deserve all of what they have and no one can tell me otherwise

I just revived my Facebook account to share Joon's UN speech and the first reactions of people are like "what? you are an ARMY?" @BTS_twt
Also, World News Now is not a gossip show so why is @kendisgibson talking about BTS’ UN speech like he was on one? Save the mockery for a show that lives off ignorant humor. WNN cant say it’s a real news program when anchors say xenophobic comments and giggle at tragic stories.
Ok but REALLY, think about it: BTS in 7 DAYS have performed 3 shows, did a speech at the UN that got the WORLD to listen & inspire to #SpeakYourself, then #BTSonFallon, & ending the 7th day with #BTSonGMA. 7 days people. 7 days. Just give them the title of world leaders please
Korea should add NAMJOON’s speech from the UN into their books/course outline and make them students study, memorize and solve it as comprehension for 100 marks. This speech needs to be on the finger tips of this unlimited generation, not only in Korean but worldwide. @BTS_twt

A news anchor from america completely disrespected bts on national live tv after the UN speech by downgrading them to a "kpop boygroup" and while the other anchor really tried to talk about how great they are, he kept saying they were only a boyband who does choreos

I do, however, think that Jess was right to call this out because in the end it is about the reason. Did you watch because BTS was giving the speech, or did you watch because there was a speech at the UN and BTS just happened to give that speech.
Just me, trying to remain calm yet still wanting to rant about that 'news anchor' who belittled BTS and Namjoon's speech at the UN general assembly. Jimmy Fallon made me happy again tho

Listened to RM and BTS's speech at the UN. Genuinely impressed by his poise and their message. Bless.
“It’s a boy band from Korea. It’s a boy band from Korea telling us how to live life.” - @abcWNN @kendisgibson Gibson’s comments/mockery on #BTS is distasteful and ignorant. He needs to rewatch Kim Namjoon’s UN speech and listen to the true message behind his story/call to action
jimmy fallon was such a good host to bts, he made them feel welcome, called them “buddy”, wore their merch and even spoke about the UN speech, i hope they do more interviews with him in the future

Is it possible to get that journalist to apologize to BTS? it was SO disrespectful to call them, "Just another boyband." making a speech at UN is a HUGE honor. Its bigger than a Grammy.
So many giod things in such small time. BV SIN moments, BTS speech in UN and #BTSonFallon ! ahhh my heart is so happy rn. @BTS_twt
im so late to the party but that interview with jimmy falloon was so much fun to watch, the boys looked so happy and comfortable and im really glad he asked them about their UN speech and their future plans and goals, this is what BTS deserve

#BTSonFallon is definitely one of my fave english interviews of the boys' so far. Unlike other interviewers who focus on the boys' dating lives and their abs, Jimmy did some research and they talked about more important things (ie. UN speech and the BTS message). (1/2)

I don't get how there's still immature fans out there who get so bothered by other kpop groups getting more representation in the West. Bts just held a speech in front of the UN !! they've done almost everything possible. There is no comparison so stop being so salty.
I loved @FallonTonightIt was really good @jimmyfallon made acertive and clever questions bringing up @BTS_twt goals and UN speech It was fun #BTS really enjoyed. I loved the challenge and how he approached them #ChimmyFallon you are the best. Welcome to A.R.M.Y #BTSonFallonpic.twitter.com/ZaqwQ3UaQS
Excellent camera work/ bromance between JIMIN and @jimmyfallon/discussion about @BTS_twt UN speech and the fornite !! Wish you could talk more about the Love Yourself series. Their music is really deep if you look beyond the surface
Somebody working on @CNN's social media must be an ARMY! Since yesterday, there has been a multitude of tweets about @BTS_twt's UN speech. As long as the tweets keep coming, I will continue to retweet & like. The message is that powerful! https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1044825401531367424 …
I'm glad my dad was suddenly interested with BTS since he saw Namjoon's speech in UN general assembly
My mom shared Joon's UN speech on Facebook and said: "BTS speaking at the UN. Way to go boys! Continue inspiring the youth with your music and way of life." Perhaps... I'm crying
@BTS_twt I wrote this poem in 2016 when I was inspired by a commercial. RM’s speech at the UN reminded me of this, and it makes me feel more confident in my writing. Thank you BTS #speakyourself #BTSxUnitedNations #BTSGrammy #BTSonGMApic.twitter.com/7KJMAKNsQo
Granted, after that speech at the UN, everything else is just a walk in the park. @BTS_twt #BTSGrammy
n e ways it was their first un speech, bts did great I literally couldn't b anymore proud
negativity // djksjd it just pisses me off seeing ppl put down bts for the speech saying it's nothing special etc. etc. bc usually it's said /just/ to tear those who were inspired down. like damn let me hear YOUR un speech since u wanna act like ur there every week giving one
He asked them about UN speech, their sold-out concerts, and the places they enjoyed in NY. BTS even performed TWO songs — one aired on TV while the other on YouTube. Jimmy went out of his way to wear a BT21 merch and ARMY bomb light-ring.

No, actual artists for the first talk about self love, mental illness etc, it was their LYRICS written by THEM that made me self love and their UN speech, just leave at this point you’re embarrassing yourself, if you love Rih so much then go and stream her songs pic.twitter.com/OyireCPxgo

Thank you for asking about their UN speech. @BTS_twt @FallonTonight #BTSonFallon
On Mon they gave a speech in UN General Assembly for a youth program called Generation Unlimited. I urge u to listen to what RM, the leader of the group, has to say. They wrote the speech using references from their lyrics, which was written by themselves. https://youtu.be/XXCqBotaGRI
This person meant throughout the whole video, the man did not talk about the fans or Bts’ message in a good way. Which I would agree with on the reporter’s last comments, where he laughed at bts being just a group with moves. But he talks about their UN speech appropriately.
Jimmy Fallon Interviews BTS: Self-Introductions, UN Speech, NYC, Grammys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4mmfzFazoI … NY REPRESENT! Couldn't be happier. Shoutout to @jimmyfallon for such a respectful, fun, and genuine interview! Big cheers! #BTS #BTSGrammy @BTS_twt @FallonTonight
Finally watched the UN speech (yeah I’m slow)...... f*** Namjoon I’m crying! @BTS_twt .... I love you so much baby
one day, we’re gonna analyze bts song lyrics. that’d be hella dope because right now we’re analyzing nas lyrics because we’re learning poetry. but i love it when english’s nd music mix together. maybe we can even analyze namjoon a amazing A+++++ worthy speech at the UN

You know how widely appealing @BTS_twt 's speech at the UN has become when even Khan Academy tweets about it https://twitter.com/khanacademy/status/1044636895769063425 …

BTS speech at the UN assembly was really inspiring
My father said he'll acknowledge BTS and their positive influence on me only when I stand on my own feet. Guess what? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. In a yr, I'll pursue my dreams, start earning, & I'll make my father finally sit & watch that UN speech & say he is proud of me
@ABC @ABCNetwork Your reports are unrespected, xenophobic and prejuices. Bts are not just a "boy band more" and the speech in the UN about "speek yourself" have a powerful message to the people. Bts and the world deserve an apologize for the words of your staff. @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/MYFL17/status/1044670470774300673 …
I saw a comment that said they stanned after UN speech and like the guy in black hoodie for the dance challenge @BTS_twt #BTSonFallon
It was a really fun tonight. Jimmy had fun with @BTS_twt , also asked them about UN speech, the performances were just on point, live. Just simple amazing.

When Jimmy asked @BTS_twt about their speech at the UN! It's such an important message and call to action to #SpeakYourself. I'm glad they got a chance to talk about it. I know Namjoon was nervous, but he did so well. #BTSonFallon

in happier things YOU KNOW WHAT i am really happy with the BTS interview on jimmy fallon; jimmy didn't act like RM was the only one there to talk to, the others felt comfortable enough to speak up in their own ways, jimmy asked about their UN speech & didn't bring up cRaZy FaNs!!
goodnight that was one of the best @BTS_twt interviews I've seen. thank you Jimmy for asking them about their speech at the UN assembly and their partnership with UNICEF :) also I don't think im going to stop laughing after watching those fortnite dances #BTSonFallon

Its been a fun show! The interaction was absolutely warm. Jimmy and BTS both had fun. They talked about their UN speech, goals and cool performance HANDS DOWN BEST #BTSonFallon
Honestly, I've been replaying Namjoon's UN speech as though it was a new BTS song. Seriously, his voice is like honey, and he spoke so eloquently, I'm so proud that I stan
Great interview @FallonTonight they were so happy and comfortable being themselves. Namjoon we are so proud of your speech at the UN it was amazing. Also what Suga wants Suga gets! Suga ARMY will get you to the Grammys! #BTSxGRAMMYS #BTSonFallon #GRAMMYs @BTS_twt
in these past 2 DAYS my parents have actually been keeping up w bts news?? i came home today & my dad reminded me that they were gonna be on jimmy fallon even though i never mentioned it to him before?? and my mom willingly watched all of joon’s un speech without mocking him??
Been sick and inactive in socmed the past couple of days. Saying hello to the world again with this photo (not mine). Namjoon's face after his UN speech. Now, the world knows all of your names. #BTS #BTSxUnitedNations #KimNamjoon #RM #BTSGRAMMYpic.twitter.com/spEKmQEElE

i am more than convinced the this is bts’ best US appearance they’re all just so comfortable with jimmy’s company like?? in a five minute talk, they were able to talk abt their future dream and their UN speech :(( #BTSonFallon
#BTSonFallon promoted the core message of #LoveYourself, tour, UN speech awareness, genuine to @BTS_twt , made #BTS fully and truly enjoy themselves and a showcased performances brilliantly! @jimmyfallon @FallonTonight
@FallonTonight hands down was @BTS_twt's BEST American talk show appearance! Jimmy asked about Namjoon's UN speech, the members were having a good time, he's an ARMY which makes the ep that more fun, and they performed IDOL and I'm Fine. I love @jimmyfallon #BTSonFallon
Im so proud of what @BTS_twt has accomplished these past few days with the speech at the UN and seeing them on @FallonTonight made my day so much better. Thank you @jimmyfallon for making them feel at home!!!! Lets get Yoongi his grammy!!!!!! #BTSonFallon #BTS #BTSGrammy
my friend from speech & debate told me today that she doesn’t rlly know who bts is and that she doesn’t listen to their music but she said that namjoon’s UN speech was amazing :’) and that made my whole night all in addition to bts being on fallon
On another note, BTS' energy since they've been here in America is so RADIATING. AND NAMJOONS UN SPEECH ddidtdiicifxiitdi
I cried listening to the speech. When I hit my 50s I hit a medical & personal wall & my self esteem took a dive. BTS & other kpop groups helped keep my spirits up. I hope that young BTS' fans can find their voice & know you have a purpose even if it is hidden right now. Thanks
Thank you so much @jimmyfallon and The Tonight show for having them. For sure they really enjoyed themselves and so did I. Also thank you for asking about their speech at the UN. Fighting!
I’m so happy @jimmyfallon asked about their UN speech, their message, goals, and even Citi field being sold out in minutes! Jimmy thank you for your warm hospitality and enthusiasm #BTSonFallon #BTSGrammy @BTS_twt @FallonTonightpic.twitter.com/Davs5xFYuw
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/tBmJaTI24TA?a BTS RM Namjoon trembled his hands during his speech at UN. So heart touching.
This is the same guys who giving speech at the UN yesterday right??? Get a group that can do both! We love you so much guys @BTS_twt #BTSonFallonhttps://twitter.com/FallonTonight/status/1044796029235810306 …
Okay so I just saw the news, and apparently BTS made a speech at the UN HQ, so does this mean BTS regained world peace? Shouldn't you be overly ecstatic right now @imogenki
ok but fr, it's really refreshing to see bts being so happy and carefree, especially after the un speech where joon must've been Going Through It, today was a really hard day for me and to have it end with so much positivity and laughter is really nice and wow I love bts so much

bts’ speech at the UN
Wow! We play @BTS_twt incredible UN speech the world is buzzing about, NEXT.- #iHeartRadioNights - @AndreaCollinsFM #BTSxUnitedNationspic.twitter.com/iiXnUrt3dc
holy shit who wants to tell 2016 suz that she saw bts live, bts sold out citified in under 10 min., bts was on two of the top late shows in the us, and bts made a speech at the un like ... it’s been such a wild ride
Listen, BTS being on Jimmy Fallon is huge bc he actually interviewed them and talked about the UN speech and the Grammy's instead of talking about what western artists they would collab with or if they've ever hooked up with an army they've such a huge global platform
Yoongi while Namjoon was speaking about his UN speech.... Yoongi, I can relate!!!! @BTS_twt #BTSonFallonpic.twitter.com/NsqMZa4Swz
@jimmyfallon You are the best. Thank you for having @BTS_twt on your show. Also, thank you for mentioning their UN Speech and the UNICEF campaign. We you. #BTSonFallon
My little sister said she watched bts on the news (for kids) yesterday, they had a whole 3 minute segement for the speech at the UN in a new show of 20 minutes. They did well
Okay buT the amount of respect everyone at the UN conference gave bts??? They didn’t mock them for being a kpop group. They listened to their speech and reacted properly and were just so??? Impressed with how much they’ve accomplished
this was, apart from the grammy museum, bts' best us tv appearance. jimmy fallon asked the real questions. he was respectful about fans camping out, did not put the crazed fangirls label on them and asked bts about their UN speech. take notes, @everyone else. #BTSonFallon
Can y’all believe this adorable squishy baby boy gave a very important & serious speech in the UN literally yesterday... the duality of Namjoon never fails to shock me #방탄소년단 #防弾少年団 #BTS @BTS_twt #BTSonFALLON #BTSxJimmyFallon #RMpic.twitter.com/7WWMMb8pvs
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS. IM CRYING SO LOUD. THANKS FOR TALKING ABOUT THEIR UN SPEECH. IM SO SO SO SO SO GRATEFUL FOR THE WAY YOU TREATED THEM. #BTSonFallon @BTS_twt
i'm so grateful to @jimmyfallon for treating our @BTS_twt so well! he gave them so much screen time, good camera work, asked good questions during the interview, gave them an opportunity to show their goofy side and even mentioned the UN speech. thank you!!! #BTSonFallon
Thank you so much for being so warm and welcoming to the boys! They had so much fun and were able to talk about the UN speech. You let us do our fanchant on air. You even did the finger heart and wore the chimmy headband. Best show ever! I U #BTSonFallon #BTSGrammy @BTS_twt
BTS was on Entertainment News on Net. Just now! They were talking about their speech at UN and their Love Myself campaign etc. I didn't record it bc I watched it with my mom and I wasn't on my phone
passion into what they do, and so much more. bts's speech at un brought me to tears, yet you completely discredit them because they are from a different country and dont speak english as well as others. it seems like you prefer music about drugs rather then music about confidence
MON: Speech at UN  TUE: BTS on Jimmy Fallon WED: BTS on GMA  THU: Newark Show - D1  FRI: Newark Show - D2 #BTSonFallon #BTSGRAMMY @BTS_twt
"HEY JIMMY, IM JIMIN!" im sorry namjoon you gave a bomb speech at the UN yesterday, but that is the quote of the century. okay plus do you see the member's reactions, jin be like frick hyung, jungkook like I want to have Jimin's name. Suga just like why am I in BTS #BTSonFallonpic.twitter.com/5zLAGvkgJO
Tonight on @FallonTonight, @jimmyfallon asked about @BTS_twt speech at the UN & future goals, hyped their new album & world tour, danced and laughed with them all while wearing a Chimmy headband and Army bomb ring. #BTSonFallon #8thMember #BTSGrammy #ChimmyFallon #Bromance
I know nothing about K-Pop, just heard few big names such as Super Junior, BTS, etc. However, BTS really caught my attention with their speech in the UN General Assembly. I did some Google on their Love Myself campaign and was really impressed. #BTSonFallon
@jimmyfallon thank you for asking @BTS_twt about the UN Speech and the message they are sending. Thank you for making them comfortable enough to be themselves, and have fun, this is the type of show they deserve! #BTSonFallon #BTS #btsgrammy @FallonTonight #ARMY
Imma read Namjoon’s UN speech to my kids as a bed time story in the future @BTS_twt
Omg!! My TL is blessed, at 1st with RM's UN speech videos, now Jimmy Fallon's BTS episodes videos..!! It seems like they enjoyed a lot, they were so happy.. Good to see that. I am so happy!! #BTSonFallon #BTS #AMAs @BTS_twt

what i really love is that jimmy didn’t ask them no silly ass ass questions. all the questions were actually about bts and about the UN speech #BTSonFallon
BTS a bit you shut your mouth and appreciate other articles about UN speech and ignore this one. If you cant appreciate it ignore it. dont be jealous your behaviour like an anti behaviour rn.
This my favorite American appearance that BTS has been on. I’m so happy you talked about the UN speech, and made each member comfortable. #ThankyouJimmyFallon !!!
My boys had fun and the interview oart was great too! They spoke about the UN speech and what it means also some fun convos also the performance was super amazing too! I love BTS so muchh! Thanks Jimmy! #BTSonFallon
Jimmy is such a genuine person. He never stereotyped us as crazy young fan girls, spoke and asked about BTS’s speech at the UN and was so down to earth that the boys looked genuinely happy and comfortable. Perhaps we’ve decided to stan. #BTSonFallon
Thank you @jimmyfallon for inviting @BTS_twt on your show and for mentioning their speech at the UN! They looked like they had a lot of fun! #BTSonFallon
seeing joon introduce himself as RM when yesterday he began his UN speech with "im kim namjoon, also known as RM of BTS" that shit lowkey hurted idk why
I loved the interview. They got to talk about the speech at UN & the message behind it. Thank you @jimmyfallon for making them feel so comfortable. #BTSonFallon @BTS_twt
jimmy fallon was probably one of the best tv show bts has been on in the united states, he seemed super interested in what they have been doing and even had the chance to bring up the UN speech. from the skit, interview, and performance you can tell bts were treated like royalty
Still feel touched because of Kim Namjoon's speech in UN. ------------- I'm voting for @BTS_twt for Favorite Social Artist #AMAs
#BTSonFallon RM said that when He is having his speech on UN Assembly his hands were shaking atleast He did it! It was inspiring! @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/2BctV7BAoS
Good job #BTS. Thank you Jimmu Fallon for inviting them! Thank you for asking Namjoon about the UN speech. They did a great performance like usual. The Fornite dance challenge was so fun!! #BTSonFallon @BTS_twt
OK I take back all my doubts on Jimmy Fallon w @BTS_twt he started w fortnite, talked abt UN speech, asked them what they liked to do, totally went w their antics, said 'we can make it happen' abt the Grammy & wore a CHIMMY headband w an army bomb ring on his finger. #BTSonFallon
I want like a BTS or RM lockscreen photo that has parts of his UN speech quoted on it. Come thru @tumblr
J/im/m/y you're not my most fave late night host but oh my god what you did for BTS -- letting them introduce themselves to the GP, talking about their UN speech, promoting their tour AND BT21 - Plus the fact that you obv stan Jimin
Thank you so much for making @BTS_twt feel comfortable and for asking them about the UN speech! @jimmyfallon #BTSonFallon
That interview was everything I hoped for and more. Not only did we get the promo for the UN speech and the new campaign, but @BTS_twt got to be their wonderful, silly selves and shine on national television before blowing everyone’s socks off with IDOL #BTSonFallon
Jimmy thank you for inviting BTS, asking them about the UN speech and for making them feel so welcome, also thanks for showing the locals that Jimin isn’t only a cute face, he’s actually really sweet and lovable that even you couldn’t resist his charms! @jimmyfallon #BTSonFallon
SHE WAS SO SLEEPY AND I WAS LIKE ”WHY DID U STAY UP” AND SHE GOES “IDK I LIKED HIS UN SPEECH SO I WANTED TO WATCH IT”
@jimmyfallon thank you for asking the boys about their UN speech. @BTS_twt looked like they had a blast https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/1044800346311323648 …
You are so delulu, facts say that RM is clearly the face of BTS, is the member that people recognize the most at first sight and after the UN speech his face is all over the news as the representative of BTS. Also, Jin is the only member with the visual title deal with it
from a speech in front of the un to doing cringy fortnite dances i love bts so much
#BTSonFallon I remembered why Jimmy is my favourite host ever The interview was really on point, he asked about the UN speech and City field and @BTS_twt inspirational and positive message. @jimmyfallon
I am amazed once again. And I love the fact that jimmy asked about the UN speech and join saying how they’re gonna stay humble! I really stan the most beautiful human beings ever. #BTS #BTSonFallon #BTSGrammy

Yesterday they gave a speech in UN about speaking up and give ourselves a voice in this generation. And today they are on Fallon being this extra. WHY ARE THEY WRECKING MY EXISTENCE LIKE THAT. I love them soo much it hurts!!!
@FallonTonight Jimmy addressing all this cultural progression by having Taraji on the same show as BTS (after their UN speech no less) has me so shaken and proud of what he’s doing with tonight’s show. You understand the importance of the people you have + workin in #BTSonFALLON
Y’all deeped that yesterday BTS was at the UN to give a speech as genUnlimited ambassadors and today they’re on late night tv doing fortnight dances and having the time of their lives
Honestly, If I ever get the chance to present about how BTS impacted my life, especially regarding that UN speech, I would start crying in front of the class
Maybe I'll make my parents watch bts' UN speech :^)

how did bts give a speech at the UN and then next day do fortnite dances for live television to see
im crying my mom just said “bts really make people’s lives better, they’re doing so much and i hope they keep doing what they can to make the world a better place” and won’t stop talking about how much she loves joons un speech
These are the same men who were giving a speech at the UN Assembly yesterday. #BTSARMY #BTS #BTSxFallon #BTSxGenUnlimited #BTSxUnitedNations #SPEAKYOURSELF
Jimmy put BTS "Fake love" showing Iranian delegate at UN reaction to Trump speech. PRICELESS. #BTSonFallon
aaaww my mom tagged me the un speech on facebook :(((( she's finally seeing bts' significance
namjoon's speech in the un? bts being included in trump jokes? wake up america, wake up and see who your true president is
He mentioned @BTS_twt UN speech!
Army let’s get #KendisGibsonBTS trended for the comments he made about BTS UN speech & their campaign. RT this tweet, spread the word, let’s get it trending. @BTS_twt @bts_bighit @bts_love_myself @Tae_Loves_Me
Wow, I you Jimmy Fallon ~ that’s exactly what I would have been doing at the UN during his speech. Nothing but FAKE LOVE. Damn, roasted!!! Namjoon and O’bama next election. @BTS_twt @jimmyfallon
Let's be real representatives at the UN we're more entertained by BTS' speech more than Trump. Not surprised #BTSxFallon
We've already seen Kim K meeting up with Trump and convincing him to show leniency to a particular criminal. Yes this speech has nothing to do with all that. That's the point. Why does the UN humour this. It may just be about self acceptance but what happens when it's not?
Jimmy Fallon stating that the people enjoyed Bts' UN speech more than trumps JKHDFSJHFDSJHFJS
I'M SO PROUD OF THEM ;____; to make this speech in the UN General Assembly!!!!!!! omg!!! I LOVE THEM TOO!!! SO, SO MUCH ;______;
JIMMY ACTUALLY SAID PEOPLE CARED MORE ABOUT BTS'S SPEECH AT THE UN THAN TRUMP, WHICH IS TRUE BUT PFJDJBSHS HE. SAID. THAT. #BTSonFallon #BTS
@jimmyfallon just called @BTS_twt the biggest boyband on the planet and shaded DT on his un speech saying some of the diplomats may have preferred Namjoons speech to his! Omfg! #BTSonFallon
. @FallonTonight REALLY MADE AN EDIT WHERE WORLD LEADERS WERE LISTENING TO @BTS_twt DURING TRUMP’S SPEECH AT THE UN, I’M–
JIMMY MENTIONED BTS' SPEECH AT THE UN FHSJS
HE BEIDBEIE MENTIONED @BTS_twt speech at the UN #BTSonFallon Omfg Fake love
He just dragged Trump's UN speech and then brought up BTS' UN speech I'm dead LMAO
Thanks @FallonTonight for mentioning @BTS_twt 's UN speech and playing #FakeLove #BTSonFallon @jimmyfallon !
YES. Shout out their UN speech! Wait OMFG… @BTS_twt #BTSonFallon

Hes speaking about bts speech at un
Lmao fallon is really dissing trump before the boys come on ... now he's talking about the boys UN speech. #BTSonFallon @BTS_twt
i rewatch namjoon's speech in the UN and it made think of an answer to his question "what makes you smile?". watching @BTS_twt smile, laugh, do what they love the most, acting younger than their age, makes me smile like an idiot in a public transportation, makes my day
THEYRE REALLY COMPARING BTS AND TRUMPS UN SPEECH IM FADINGBHDHS
Cant imagine myself to have a speech sa UN like what @BTS_twt did. Super nakakaPROUD! Haters just use keyboard and do nothing in their lives. Find something meaningful to do instead of talking nonsense . #BTSxUnitedNations
My mother really hate BTS ... I have been telling her about how grreat they are and about how much they achieved and the motivational Un speech “ see mom I stan really awesome people “ Mom:” everyone tries to look like them , who do they they are , before they tell people
can you believe when bts went to have a their UN speech their oldest was just 25 and their yougest was just 21 i wanna cry
I am extremely disappointed in your words towards bts on your recent broadcast. I had really hoped after the UN speech, media outlets might do some research into bts and treat them with the respect they deserve in American Primetime Media.
#bts #BTSonFallon @BTS_twt I hope they get asked about the UN's speech

only bts would go from giving a serious speech at a un conference to going into complete crackhead mode on jimmy fallon hbsjsjsjs

@kendisgibson your little comments about BTS, Namjoon's speech at the UN and their UNICEF campaign were way out of place, uneducated, uninformed and unprofessional to say the least. Better yourself and apologize.
@ABCNetwork We the #BTSARMY are asking for an apology from @kendisgibson for his blatantly racist, ignorant and dismissive comments regarding @bts_bighit & the validity of the speech they gave at the UN. The level of unprofessionalism should not be ignored. Please make this right

@kendisgibson I’m really disappointed at the reaction you gave to BTS’ speech at the UN. You are a MINORITY and you mocking them by saying they are a “boy band from KOREA” is disgusting. They help us get through depression with their music so don’t belittle their words!

Ignorance can always be fixed, but the fact that he was given the information for the campaign that BTS is promoting and he knew that RM had given a speech at the UN Assembly of all places, he still chose to dismiss their efforts.
dont u love it when kpop stans start preaching bts for their presence and speech at the UN as if they weren’t throwing them under the bus before the hypocrisy jumped out big time

The speech of BTS at the UN was met with much appreciation while Donald Trump earned guffaws. I have always believed that when our political institutions are broken, the artists, the poets, and the dreamers need to remind us of our collective conscience. Good job, BTS.

Any news if Ilsan is planning to have a Kim Namjoon monument after that UN speech? Coz you know, he deserves it. P.S. a @BTS_twt monument on Seoul doesn't sound so bad too.
it makes me incredibly happy when i see people praising/giving credit to others, just spreading positivity apart from our differences / interests my irl were talking abt the UN speech by bts, altho we're not fans but it was rly well thought out, everyone should give it a listen
It’s too early for me to spill the tea for those ignorant people talking shit about BTS speaking at UN and about Namjoon with his speech itself. Listen, you idiots. Keep talking shit, be xenophobic and be ignorant of what these boys have done and are continuously doing.
++ She was going to speak about girls education, so on top of seeing BTS in person and being with them, she was also about to give a speech on the UN GA. Yeah it might have been stupid but it's not something that she should be hated on for. If you know who she is and what she++

Ok but I'm so proud of ARMY today. Like @BTS_twt-UN speech-rubbed off on all of you proud. I must have seen thousands of posts of ARMY speaking out in positive ways, making their voices heard. You used your voices well, you harnessed ARMY power for good. [ #BTS #TheGroup]
what do bts have to do to just gain respect from people and media. like they really just gave an eye opening speech at the freaking un and people are still just calling them a boy band, and saying they’re doing it for the fan girls?? seriously, what do they need to do.

I know @kendisgibson might fnd it rdiculous of why, BTS'Army, r making this matter unnecessarily huge & might say that we r over reacting. Bt we r not just fans, we r the YOUTH, and by giving dat kind of sarcasm to BTS status as an artist/idols to give speech at UN, is offending.

actually no if BTS sees this somebody tell namjoon that he did exceptionally well during his speech at the UN — this is what sets BTS apart from other groups, the ability to be honest with the world and he did that so well #BTSonFallon
Thank you for mentioning Kim Namjoon's beautiful and powerful speech @khanacademy! I started making use of your resources since 2011 and it helped me so much throughout my student years. I am glad to see you sharing such important words
saying that this matter is out of our line, or we are too young for smthing like this. So this @ABC host's remarks of @BTS_twt attendance and speech at the @UN convention is just one example of what we, YOUNG people, get to the world of adults.

Why BTS chosen to give a speech in UN? Of course, BTS is just most popular boyband in World. But... That’s all. “Love yourself” is a catch phrase for weak in society. They’re not saying, not singing for anti-racism, feminism, anti-homophobia. and They’re a native, cisgender,
honestly i thot ppl were unstanning bc of the fans which i can understand. lmao. but hating on bts themselves is just. anyways i wonder what trunglr had to say abt namjoon's UN speech they probably were saying some more shit

I think it might be the way those clothes drape him. We’ll probably be able to tell better when it airs. That said, I’m sure they ALL have lost some with all the performances. And a bit of stress anticipating the UN speech. He knows we watch over him so he can’t get by w/ much.

honestly it's kinda sad. bc when people hear "BTS" they immediately look down at anything related to them because 1. it's kpop and 2. fangirls. like if a speech at the UN for the UNICEF and youth isn't going to be of value to you, then nothing is.

#BTSonFallon I LOVE YOU BANGTAN! AFTER LISTENING TO YOUR UN SPEECH BY MY PRECIOUS BAE NAMJOON I AM NOW AN ARMY FOREVER!
@BTS_twt you know, after hearing your full speech that you spoke upon at the UN really got me thinking. You said to speak yourself, once I heard that everything just came to my mind. Thank you Namjoon oppa and BTS, you guys have officially opened my eyes...

@UNICEF @GMA BTS and their speech at UN, their partner UNICEF, and UN who invited them were mocked at once with this silly anchor. @ABC Is this what you really wanted to show us?https://twitter.com/naswithlove/status/1044661663394418689 …
[ENG] The Korean media mentioned @BTS_twt #Namjoon for sending a message to global youth "to love" during his speech at the UN General Assembly as part of his campaign with UNICEF.

bts stay at the top with their UN speech nothing can top that why are we being insecure armys
We often talked about their duality, we got used to them. Yet from UN speech to Jimmy Fallon's show I hope they can capture the hearts of gp with their dorkiness #BTS @BTS_twt Favourite Social Artist #AMAs
It'll take me awhile to move on from Namjoon's UN speech. He didn't use big words, he didn't try to impress anyone, he was drawing experience from himself, his @BTS_twt brothers and ARMYs - real ppl facing real problems in real world & that what makes it powerful and relatable pic.twitter.com/JJaMnL9bkO
. @UNICEF @UNICEFmedia @_GenUnlimited FYI: Khan Academy posted @BTS_twt UN speech on its Instagram account: "Inspirational words from [BTS] at the #UnitedNations yesterday on overcoming failure, learning from mistakes and self acceptance" https://www.instagram.com/p/BoJ8AAgFBvm/?hl=en …
My class was rlly tryna clown bts again today so i made them watch Joon’s UN speech and they all shut up real quick. And said it was a really good speech and that it was nice to watch. Booyah.
never thought i would see the day that BTS gives a more eloquent UN speech than the president of the united states, yet here we are
My friend asked why I love BTS so much and I explained to her how= they helped me. I showed her Answer: Love Myself and she loves it! Now, she's gonna watch Namjoon's UN speech. She understands why they're loved now, she loves the message they send! #PCAs #TheGroup #BTS @BTS_twt
Namjoon ah! Your speech at the UN assembly was so beautiful! I got tears listening to your speech. You did amazing BTS. Thank you for always making amazing music and inspiring people. I Purple U BTS #BTSonFallon #BTS @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/nsxgdhEhu3
How did bts go from giving a speech at the un to dancing fortnite on live television
I just love how Namjoon gave a touching speech at the UN yesterday but today he’s slapping imaginary buts and yelling YEEHAW @BTS_twt
i almost cried i’m so proud of our boy for speaking so well and although he was nervous this speech was so meaningful and they’ve been using their platform to help others and to teach us to put ourselves first and it honeslty restores some of my faith in humanitythem the most
I’m telling you right now...I cried at the college campus gym about RM’s speech at the UN. I never cry people just #LoveYourself Literally so inspiring for people around the world #bts #btsfam #RM #EPIPHANY #LoveYourselfWorldTour #BTSxJimmyFallon #findyourvoice #UN
They were perfect. love the speech of RM. I love them!!!
@kendisgibson The comments made of @BTS_twt in live TV were xenophobic. This was what BTS's speech in the UN was about: not caring the background of people. BTS is from South Korea, so what? @ABC @ABCNetwork, educate your reporters and tell him to apologize.

My TL right now is a battle between praise and awe on Namjoon's epic speech on UN yesterday and Namjoon's YEEHAW in a short clip from Jimmy Fallon. I love him. @BTS_twt
@kendisgibson The UN knew that inviting BTS would draw enormous interest in the program and they were right as many listened to the speech. Your ignorance regarding BTS reflects your character. You are not fit to clean their toilet.
FYI: @BTS_twt will be on @FallonTonight. People who attended the taping said that Jimmy Fallon asked them about the UN speech @_GenUnlimited #UNGA #Youth2030 #BTSonFallon
From emotional empowering speech at the UN to the adorable dorks on #BTSxJimmyFallon they summed up everything Armys love about them @BTS_twt Favorite Social Artist #AMAs
Some ABC reporter basically reduced BTS to “just a kpop band” even after hearing Joons powerful UN speech
Someone sent it to me at like 3am so when I woke up it was on my TL. I’ve been smiling and laughing about it all day. My husband hates BTS but between Joon’s UN speech yesterday and now this,even he had to smile
@kendisgibson I saw your story regarding BTS' speech at the UN. Your commentary showed a lack of understanding of BTS and their music. RM's IQ is 148 and he with the other members write and produce their music focusing on issues important to youth.

my sister was impressed over @BTS_twt 's UN speech and she wants to show it to our parents because she loved the message ... and she's a non-army :') im so glad people who aren't armys can see how meaningful namjoon's speech was
september is really bts’s month like two birthdays, concert dates, tv appearances, a UN speech??? this belongs to bts only
hi i usually don’t talk about BTS because i’ve never really gotten into them (and i don’t wanna come off as pandering to their massive audience) but WOW Namjoon’s speech to the UN gave me chills. what an incredible message.
bts schedules are weird af. from UN speech to fortnite dance challenge perhaps I love these dorks
U r not getting anything as long as we dont get an apology from u & ur journalist. @kendisgibson wasnt only mocking BTS' & their speech at the UN for UNICEF but also mocking millions of young people all over the world with that. It's ur job to present news not judge about them
im having a hard time believing this is the same man who just gave an inspiring speech at the UN yesterday

I need go to sleep, but i can’t bcz i think of how much i appreciate and love my boys, how proud i am, even tho i don’t post anything about yesterdays UN speech, here is a lot of emotions and thoughts in my head #bts
.....only bts can do the fortnite dance challenge on jimmy fallon nearly immediately after giving a passionate speech at the un ......only them...
bts: does a really serious and important speech in front of the un literally making history also bts the next day: pic.twitter.com/NvO2xfHD6X
Is this the same Joon that delivered a moving speech in the UN yesterday? I love that he can be a dorky and respectable at the same time...
bts being crackheads after giving a speech in UN....amazing
I love how Namjoon went from perfectly poised composed and professional at the UN speech to this get you a man who can do both
me: ok im gonna tweet only about svt for the next few days bts: does the UN speech, releases bv ep 2, about to go hang with jimmy me: WHAT do you want from me WHAT
nAMJOON ALSKJDSKD THIS MAN GAVE A SPEECH AT THE UN YESTERDAY WE LOVE DUALITY
BTS just don't deserve this disrespectful attude. He was talking about their speech at UN,so I want him to tell apologize not just to bangtan but also to UNICEF. @kendisgibson good luck.

bts: *gave a speech at the UN encouraging the youth to speak and let their voice be heard, actually uses their platform and popularity to do something good* xenophobes: korean dudes with crazy and noisy songs and choreographed moves that make millions of fangirls scream and cry
He talks about awareness in his twitter posts but totally discredited BTS for giving a awareness speech on UN. Why? Cause they are just a bunch of korean boys. One word for him "FAKE"
My mom asked me if bts gave a speech at the un and I said yes I told her it was about youth and because they're the ambassadors for UNICEF. I also told her Joon's speech was amazing. I couldn't stop smiling because of how proud I am. @BTS_twt @UN @UNICEF

wow im really surprised to see that brazilian media rlly talking about how amazing bts did with their UN speech and how they're making such a great impact on youth nowadays, even taking some nice tweets from fans and discussing it, kend*s g*bson can't relate
@abcWNN I am extremely disappointed in the coverage of BTS’s speech at the UN in support of #GenerationUnlimited. I was shocked at the condescending attitude @kendisgibson used in belittling their efforts to support a world-wide effort in empowering youth & ensuring education...
So I let my friend read RM's Un Speech and she is moved so much so I started to tell her the different quotes and speeches that our leader has made and she is impressed. @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations
in other news the bts speech at the un was INCREDIBLE
I am disappointed at @ABC @ABCNetwork for allowing @kendisgibson to report on BTS's UN speech with blatant disrespect. The words and attitude that your news reporter displayed is completely UNPROFESSIONAL!
Namjoon's speech at the UN meeting was so inspiring and made my heart clench with emotion at the knowledge of where the whole of BTS started and where they're at now. Like wow...they've DONE that. I cannot WAIT to see what other accomplishments they achieve

You know I don’t really stan bts anymore but I must say Namjoon’s speech at the UN was fantastic. They’re doing incredible work.
@kendisgibson cannot call bts just “a boyband from korea” with “choreographed dance moves” when he’s literally some no name reporter. i dont see him raising awareness and millions of dollars to help children in need??? i dont see him giving a speech at the un???
I know absolutely nothing about K-Pop but those BTS kids did a better job at that UN speech than most leaders. Their fans must be so proud.
I was shopping earlier at @TorridFashion before my trip to see @BTS_twt this weekend and I had a wonderful talk with an employee there. She learned of #BTS from the award shows and saw Namjoon’s speech at the UN yesterday on Facebook. I’m so proud. pic.twitter.com/WXmsjaz8zu

BTS during their Speech at UN
dave: did you watch the bts speech at that un thing? me: dave: of course you did, you jerk
Kendis Gibson must be off from the news. BTS's speech has been inspiring to young people all over the world. You absolutely insulted UN, BTS and young people.
@abcWNN I'd be embarrassed and ashamed of your anchors on your show with their lack of knowledge and research done on BTS UN Speech in partnership with Unicef and GenerationUnlimited. They chose the point they should make fun of the easiest and undermine with the least effort.
but we already established that it’s not totally false i.e “kpop isn’t perfect” “slave contract” “mistreatment” “greedy agency” “dating ban” so WHY bts has to suffer from this. a media outlet said bts UN speech wasn’t genuine bc the kpop industry has all these negative points.
to those who are degrading the value of BTS’s UN speech purely because of the fact that they’re korean, check yourselves.

The blatent disrespect that @kendisgibson showed in regards to BTS speaking at the UN is unacceptable, unprofessional and overall embarrassing @abcnews @ABC I and many others expect some form of apology for diminishing everyone who was represented through the speech given.
The ARMYs dropping links to BTS' UN speech in the replies of verified accounts to answer people's questions of why people should care about BTS... it's beautiful, tbh. I stan.
You know what? BTS don't need some dumbass reporters bullshit rn. They literally just came from the UN and Namjoon gave a fucking powerful speech. We should focus on that and praise them on their hard work. Nobody else deserves our attention. #BTS #BTSxUnitedNations
I was about to RT, but I realized it's your network that has an anchor @kendisgibson who belittled BTS's speech and work with the UN because they're "a Korean boy band."
the UN also aims to promote human rights. any person can do a google search and see that one of the aims of bts' unicef campaign is to help stop violence towards children. now tell me why they don't have the place to stand and give a speech to the UN?
younger generation just because he is a politician by career? the UN is there to provide a platform for dialogue. and that is exactly what bts are doing as young adults, not that anyone criticising them can be bothered to even listen to their speech anyway.
fyi this is a VERY SERIOUS issue. 1000's of online requests and 100's of phone call requests, get zero radio airplay. News anchors on air mocking "its just a Korean boyband" and "its just noise" after a UN speech. This after 2 #1's on the BB. BTS and ARMY problems are real.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/nLSZum3P1PE?a BTS Deliver A Powerful Speech At The UN

wtf does jjong have to do with bts’ un speech???? why are they even mentioning him
Your speech was everything #loveyourself
that’s not what my original tweets says tho. so idk why you jumping to conclusions saying i’m xenophobic. no one said bts have to erase their korean identity. i’m saying the term KPOP is holding them back bc just today 2 media outlets downplayed their speech at the UN for that. https://twitter.com/jojohaseul/status/1044713998879543296 …
it's BTS, They are loved by a lot of people because they have a beautiful message and they produce and write amazing music. Check out their UN speech https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
I literally just cried so much a few minutes ago because: 1. I’m missing UP10TION already. 2. Also the people I met in Germany. 3. BTS’ UN speech. 4. I miss Philippines. 5. I’m behind schedule for ALL my projects. 6. I need to clean my apartment. My head is so full!!
. @kendisgibson Your behavior while speaking about BTS’ UN speech was absolutely disgusting. They are more than just a “Korean boyband with choreographed dance moves”. They successfully using their platform to make a difference. Shame on you for bashing them for that
@kendisgibson Honestly it’s embarrassing how unprofessional you were when speaking about the BTS speech for the UN campaign. I hope you’ll take time to self-reflect on why you are so prejudiced against harmless things like boybands and choreographed dancing as you put it
I showed my mom BTS’s UN speech. She cried while watching it and said they were highly intelligent men. I told her this is why I love them so much. She says she also loves them, now
i told my dad that bts was going to make a speech for the UN AND HE LITERALLY SAID THAT ITS BECAUSE HE TOLD THEM TO DO SO AHAHHAHA OML
So this week UN gets Kim Nam-Joon in an inspiring, intelligent, positive, and inclusive speech and today Trump. Both made me cry for vastly different reasons.
Im still upset. I don't know why this hurts more than all the times. How can anyone think that especially after Namjoons UN speech? How? All it takes is a quick search to see all the things BTS. After the #/SpeakYourself when peopl told their stories of how BTS has helped them

@kendisgibson @abcWNN they are literally changing lives, helping people by their music. And you were like "A Korean boyband?" . Giving speech at UN is not joke, you didn'tjst insulated BTS but also @UNICEF , BTS ARMYs and those people who're suffering from depression, anxiety +
So nobody laughed when Kim Namjoon of @BTS_twt delivered his earnest UN speech yesterday. Pretty telling when a KPOP group does UN speaking better than the leader of the free world. #GenerationUnlimited #BTSxGenUnlimited #bts pic.twitter.com/fZB2bVSDLO
so my supervisor at work told me how she watched BTS’ speech at the UN yesterday and the line that really stood out to her was when joon said “most people thought we were hopeless” bc she believes that k media really aren’t giving BTS the credit they deserve.
Listen to IDOL, Fake Love, DNA and Spring Day. (Plus more if you like what you hear!) Then watch RM's AMAZING UN speech!

I am so disappointed in the words of @kendisgibson on @ABC @ABCNetwork about @BTS_twt speech in the UN. Downplaying them to just a "boy band from Korea with choreographed dance moves" and insulting Namjoon's grammar despite him not originally being English? IMPROVE YOURSELF.
yesterday BTS were invited to give a speech for the UN, tonight they’re gonna be on Jimmy Fallon, tomorrow on GMA. this week is gonna be all BTS all the time and i am so ready.
@BTS_twt strives to fight against through their music and positive representation in current issues, just as they did in their UN speech yesterday. Who are you to talk/imply things from a higher place, against an initiative that is nothing but inspirational & for a good purpose?
I don’t understand what possessed him to laugh at what BTS are doing. They’re using their platform for good. Having bts attend and give a speech at UN is so important, and nobody can taint it. I wish the reporters are better educated and learn how to report accurately in future.
Funny you came ALL the way to a group post who you hate just to comment an irrelevant shit but trust me their both albums have gone number one this year only and they broke many records, this post ain’t even about their music it’s about their speech for UN and their UNICEF prog pic.twitter.com/vK7W15vhlb
Cc @ABC @ABCNetwork What kind of people do you employ? First, . @kendisgibson should study the real reason why BTS was invited to give such an important speech at the UN, and how they are working with @UNICEF. Second, viewers and mainly BTS, deserve a public apology. (1)

@kendisgibson What you said about BTS and their UN speech was extremely unprofessional &rude. You should not be racist cuz you are the face of @ABCNetwork. Don’t forget eventually fools change the world. Your opinion matters but not when it hurts or defames others. #SpeakMyself
does anyone have a transcript of bts' un speech....
listen... even if you arent a fan of bts, please go watch namjoons speech at UN. its so important, beautiful and out of all things honest, please. do yourself a favour.
Delighted to have been in the Trusteeship Council Chamber in person to see this myself. There was a respectful hush during the speech.

A french show made a segment about bts un speech
This has nothing to do with the boys being from Korea or them having choreographed songs. This was an inspirational speech used to empower the youth, and what pisses me off is the fact that they made fun of it because the words came from Korean Boys.
@kendisgibson did you even try to listen or watch #RM's Speech for you to scoff on them being a #UNGA Youth Representative!? You mocking 'em & belittling where they came from & what they do as an Artist from South Korea has nothing to do with 'em DOING KINDNESS to the WORLD!
Here’s some of the comments on a Insta post on Bts’s speech at the UN meeting. Comments are mixed; some are good and respectful and some are ignorant. Some comments said that this speech surprised them and was powerful and might give them a listen. Ofc, others weren’t. pic.twitter.com/2MgXVb6kD9
Hey @989RadioNow!, BTS gave an awesome speech at the UN yesterday and are going to be on Jimmy Fallon tonight! It would be awesome to hear IDOL by @BTS_twt ft. @NICKIMINAJ in order to support them! -
Thanks for writing about @BTS_twt's UN speech! Also, read & enjoyed the your article about the ImagineNative festival. It's lovely to read about the film industry embracing greater diversity.
Can you please ask 1 of your news anchor @kendisgibson to watch all of @ABC @ABCNetwork @abcnews @abcWNN 's coverage of #UNGA esp. @BTS_twt's speech 'cause we want to know understand where his MOCKERY of #BTS as Youth Ambassadors & Reps is coming from please!? He OWEs an APOLOGY!
So he's okay if BTS sing, dance, rap but not when BTS gives a speech during a UN General Assembly, huh?
Man, if someone told me that @BTS_twt would perform on many well known shows in the US, have an interview with the Grammy Museum, perform on GMA, & has a speech at the UN before it all started... I would of been like skeeeethat'sdarndidilyright
So excited for #BTSonGMA. I'm still so incredibly moved by the speech that @BTS_twt gave at the @UN assembly. Thank you BTS, for spreading love and light on others and teaching others to #LoveYourself and #SpeakYourself. I'm so thankful to have your music #BTS @THETonyMorrison

bts is really out there giving a speech in front of the UN about youth empowerment and how important it is to love yourself. kings
And this is why they were giving a speech at the UN. BTS will just keep proving over and over again that you cannot force them into a mold. They'll continue to use their platform to inspire the youth.
@BTS_twt RM sir I heard your speech at the UN! I tried to accept my past self. I'm trying to learn from my mistakes. I'm trying! But it's really tiring. I'm tired! You said you were thankful that you didn't give up! And I don't want to give up either but it's tiring. I'm tired
Can't believe that there are so many deserving people who work hard and have dreams of their future career to find out that they aren't hired because racist/disrespectful people already took it. This is exactly what BTS are talking about from the UN speech yesterday @abcWNN @ABC
So BTS gave a speech at UN, PeopleTV used it as an opportunity and made a non-related kpop poll, then deleted it when NCT 127 won lol is using kpop groups for clout a thing these days?
Hi @kendisgibson BTS once said in a speech "We understand that our words carry weight". This phrase may allude simplicity, but after hearing what you call coverage for their UN speech, led me to believe that MANY terribly fail to apply such concept. Yours were not JUST words, +
Picture of me and bby Jimin taken by @theknoodle at our group show @magicshophamont!! Feeling extra proud after their speech at the UN Can't wait till they come back #bts #animation #BTSinHamiltonpic.twitter.com/IKwLqB9GPg
I’m so appalled by the ignorance that’s out there! I just read about that news reporter who was so condescending towards BTS for their speech at the UN. I don’t even want to tag his name in this post because really, why are we giving him any sort of relevance...but WOW!
They truly bring their light everywhere they go I'm not as eloquent as Kim Namjoon so I can't fully explain how his speech made me feel but I hope they never lose the fire that keeps them going and guiding everyone else along the way. Thanks UNICEF for this opportunity!
@abcWNN disappointing how your anchor @kendisgibson straight up disrespected and made fun of bts. It's highly unprofessional and not acceptable. Instead of just reporting about their campaign and speech to the UN you let your prejudices and blatant xenophobia show+
so i just watched joon's speech @UN General assembly, I'm so proud of @BTS_twt it made me cry.

Imagine looking down on BTS when they’ve been invited by UNICEF to give a speech at the UN headquarters just because you’re an English-speaking Westerner... the xenophobia jumped out! He couldn’t even breathe the same air as BTS in that building the AUDACITY
bts have done more for the youth and the world than a lot of western artists have, if a western artist spoke that speech at the UN they wouldn’t be saying the same shit.
Mr. @kendisgibson i was greatly offended with your manner of presenting news about BTS giving a speech in front of dignitaries in UN assembly.
Dear Namjoon, Thank you for the amazing UN speech. I cried because it was so beautiful. You and the other members make us ARMY's love ourselves more every say because of you You are a superhero in our eyes and you'll always stay one #RM #BTSxUnitedNations #BTSnaGloboNews #BTS pic.twitter.com/QAZQjCQrC7
@kendisgibson @ABCWorldNews BTS' speech at the UN had to do w/ Generation U and UNICEF. It's their activism & their humanitarian work. It's their willingness to be the voice of the youth, to help with more than just words. Your comments were unnecessary. #MoreThanAKoreanBoyband

First, thank you for sharing their speech at UN BUT I can't forgive the way YOUR stuff @romankemp keep disrespecting @BTS_twt music. Such unprofessional behavior ...At least we are expenting an apology. Make things right. LOVE YOURSELF - SPEAK YOURSELF
@kendisgibson how dare u talk about bts that way if ur so full of everything why didn't U get called for a speech at the UN?????
The way he laugh at saying "Korean boy band". A mockery not to Bts but to whole Koreans. He laughs at UN speech. What a great guy.
Obviously no research was done into the events of the day at the UN or the numerous speeches about giving young people a voice, an opportunity & education. Sadly no research into what the entire speech given by Kim Namjoon of BTS entailed, just mocking a phrase Speak yourself ?!
of course we have people reducing bts to just " some boyband " this fucking boyband is much more than what anyone fucking perceives them as. don't belittle them and joons inspirational UN speech that is SOME SERIOUS BULL SHIT
i hope @jimmyfallon talks to bts about their UNICEF campaigns and Namjoon’s speech at the UN yesterday. It deserves immense recognition after the media vomited all over it.
@kendisgibson I hope you are aware of the beast you have awoken with your remarks on the BTS UN speech. The influence these boys have spreads far and wide and we are not so quick to forgive. There will be consequences for your lack of professionalism.
Dear @ABCNetwork and @ABCWorldNews, Your “reporter“ @kendisgibson had the freedom to make demeaning and racist comments about BTS on your show. Not liking them is fine but to mock their speech at the UN is just plain disrespectful. We demand an apology. A sincere one.
But the work they do along side UNICEF. How ignorant and crass can you be to act in such a manner about this particular topic simply because they are artists that you don't enjoy. The UN speech was eloquently made in the wake of their Love Yourself campaign. you owe BTS and +
the media is something else today. y’all are so blind to see the goodness of what bts are trying to achieve that badly? like it was at the UN... where people don’t just go? they get invited? at the end of the day, y’all are giving joon’s speech more power
it honestly brings tears to my eyes thinking about how far bts have come. they went from the brink of disbanding to giving a speech at the UN conference it’s literally unbelievable.
As a fan, I couldn't be more disgusted at how @kendisgibson acted towards @BTS_twt. They just made an inspirational speech at the UN Headquarters but apparently they don't matter because they're just a "korean boy band who spread their legs". @ABC @ABCNetwork, fix this mess.
Hey @kendisgibson A news segment about BTS has been going around, showing you talking about the leader's UN speech in a mocking tone and being very keen on pointing out that "They're a boy band from Korea" while your co-worker is trying to professionally present the news.
My favorite story of the day: Kim Namjoon, the leader of BTS (who are not only artists, but also a movement), gave a powerful speech about self-love and youth at the UN general assembly and was applauded by world leaders. https://twitter.com/kendisgibson/status/1044544344718331904 …
It’s sad... I really thought and hoped maybe ppl would start to respect and see BTS more than a boyband after they were asked to be present at the UN Assembly and had Namjoon give such a powerful, moving speech. Sigh I’m disappointed but sadly not at all surprised
[ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy” https://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak via @YouTube
@abcWNN what @kendisgibson did was so wrong. BTS did a speech for the UN encouraging youth to speak up, to stand up for themselves no matter their skin color, gender identity, but he reduced them to just a "bunch of koreans with dance moves". So disrespectful and unprofessional
So a friend of mine who doesn't know about BTS, shared namjoon UN's speech on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/QhxXrxjwCM
her manager: just thank bts for the speech and move on to your own this is the fucking un superwoman: no why not imply fangirls arent worth taking seriously, reducing them to people blindly screaming for anything, telling young girls their love for x thing isnt real or important, https://twitter.com/GIPHY/status/1044271184555200512 …
I still can't believe @abcWNN stands for World News Now and they actually aired the most xenophobic and disdainful response to BTS at the UN. The show and @kendisgibson lost ALL credibility because he obviously didn't listen to the speech or research the movement. World news? Ha.
Right! Them dancing and being a band has nothing to do with their speech. He clearly states the speech was about loving yourself and speaking for yourself, but then chose to end the segment with his disappointing comments.
Sounds great to me! "even for BTS" is pretty terribly dismissive especially considering the charade of a newscast you put on today. You don't have to like their music, but belittling them on air is unprofessional and unacceptable. They were giving a speech at the UN.

i've seen so many people give BTS backhanded complements about them speeching at the UN, saying that 'a korean boyband gave a speech at the UN - this is the dark timeline' and it's exhausting? they worked hard for it, maybe accept that?
BTS was giving an inspiring speech at the UN while @romankemp was being disrespectful towards them ! And this is the second time he’s done that , we want an apology and for this to stop!

@kendisgibson hello. as a BTS army, i dont really appreciate the way u acted and the comments u made while reporting on their speech at UN. if u dont know much about the boys, How about just reporting n not saying whatever u feel like saying? its completely rude.
i find it embarrassing how you were laughing at bts when they’re the ones who held a whole speech for the UN, like what have you done other than be irrelevant ? the unprofessional jumped out and i hope you get fired :) @abcWNN @ABCNetwork
AAAAAA- I POSTED A VIDEO OF PART OF NAMJOON'S SPEECH 12 TIMES ON MY INSTAGRAM BECAUSE IT NEEDED TO BE HEARD AND EVERYONE WHO SAW IT MULTIPLE TIMES WAS FORCED TO LISTEN BECAUSE IT KEPT POPPING UP ON THEIR FEED SO TEEHEEHEEnow I'm gonna go do my Spanish homework
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak?a [ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy”
The first thing I find out once I logged in is a reporter being Xenophobic & dismissing BTS' UN speech and the sad thing is that I'm not even surprised
I SAW BTS ON FRENCH TV BC THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE UN SPEECH THEY DID UWUUUUU SO PROUD @BTS_twt
"dad, why is my sister named rose?" "because your mother like roses" "wow, thanks dad!" "no problem, BTS Kim Namjoon’s Speech @73rd UN General Assembly"
it's saddening because all the prejudice and racism jumped out after their UN speech :( bts don't deserve these
Not only was this disrespectful to BTS but also the UN and the #GenerationUnlimited campaign. You could’ve highlighted facts like how the speech was given in their second language but instead you focused on something unrelated to the campaign, aiming to devalue it @kendisgibson
I can't even express how much respect and love I have for #KimNamjoon. Even though he was so nervous at a prospect of addresing UN General Assembly that his hands were shaking, he still gave an eloquent, heartfelt and inspiring speech. #보라해 @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044291616834371584 …

They gave a whole speech at the UN and had a whole love yourself campaign that started a year ago but people can't see beyond their race and job. They just downgraded all of BTS's hardwork because they can't understand how a 'boyband' is creating a movement in the world
The UN Speech will always be close to my heart @BTS_twt I love you. Thank you.
That fact that he had the guts to say joon's speech sounds fake. I can't handle this shit. People should know when not to cross line. The reason why BTS attended UN & he didn't clearly proves the impact they've on this World.
@ABCWNN you have good rating, but too bad that your news anchor @kendisgibson has messing things up by mock on BTS speech at @UN with their campaign Love Myself to support @_GenUnlimited this is such a shame that a tv program with a lot of views saying this. I'm so upset

I was just watching @trackpop_'s reaction to RM's UN speech and they were talking about how bts appearance in their lives came with such amazing timing that it's almost eerie, and I relate 100%. I think most of us feel that way. they appeared just when we needed them
BTS are literally doing nothing wrong damn we thought that after the UN speech people were going to take them more seriously but because they are a Korean boyband they get belittled for their hard work, they are legit doing something useful, they deserve way more than this :(
Dear @kendisgibson and @abcWNN , @ABCNetwork. I caught your segment on BTS and Kim Namjoons speech at the UN and I am appalled at your behaviour. How dare you take his words of love and turn them into a mockery. They are not just a “boyband from Korea “ they are much more then

Ignorance is not always bliss. It lead to unprofessional behavior and disrespect towards not only BTS but towards the UN and UNICEF. Those reporters, specifically the male should have paid more attention to Joons speech. Maybe then he wouldn't have made such asinine statements.
@abcWNN @kendisgibson you need to apologize for being extremely unprofessional while talking about bts' UN speech. your reporters made unnecessary remarks, and it should've never happened. Either you cover the news as it should be or just dont talk about it at all.
My ancient greek teacher just showed my entire class all of namjoon's speech @the un bc he thought it was very aristotelian and in general a very good speech gg @BTS_twt
@kendisgibson, I just want to say, as a woman of color, to a poc, for you to exhibit xenophobia in your seat as a reporter, to downgrade @BTS_twt's thought-provoking speech at the UN Assembly into them just being a "boyband from Korea," I'm disappointed and demand an apology.

also it's so obvious that half the ppl covering the UN speech don't give 2 sh;ts about it bc they are mocking us for liking bts in the same breathe, it's 'we need to help the young ppl' but also 'lmao look at these brainless girls who only know how to drool over boys hahaha'

Namjoon’s speech at the UN was absolutely beautiful. I’ve made so many wrong choices in my life, but stanning and loving BTS is one of those right choices that I will definitely never regret.
If y'all thought Kim Namjoon's speech at the UN General Assembly was moving & iconic, wait until what you hear what they write about in Korean. Y'all are missing out on brilliant lyrics & a powerful message. There's a reason @BTS_twt are where they are now.
Yesterday @BTS_twt gave a speech at the UN. Today, Trump also addressed the UN general assembly. RM’s of BTS was praised and lauded, while the supposed leader of the free world was laughed at. It’s a bizarro world... pic.twitter.com/QSuc7zE1jf

imagine thinking that BTS doesn't have the korean gp's support when they created a masterpiece called Spring Day which is the longest charting song on melon, had a speech at the UN, bring the most money to korea and their worldwide success which made the gp proud to be koreans...
The reason people hate on ARMYs is because of the many Stan's/fans who mock other groups. Like "BTS is better than (group) because they were made a speech at the UN meeting" like no.
She was good until she got little too carried away with her shout out to bts there. It’s a speech in a UN conference addressed towards the youths. eta to bts er shudhu fan der uddheshe ment deya na. So erokom kisu bolar dorkar ee chhilona
@BTS_twt your last speech at the UN really had me into tears. like im never crying like that in my life. i kept asking myself who i am? what should i do so i can love myself? then i got the answer. thankyou joon, thankyou so much

Same! I'm 50 and I'm a huge BTS fan. I was so proud of them. The speech was beautiful. And they remain so humble and realize their responsibility as celebrities and how important their music is to youth all over the world.
Yes. Their music is great too. The one who delivered the UN speech is a composer, producer and the leader of the group. You should listen to spring day by BTS with English subs. It’s a great song.
Thank you for covering this news. They always inspire me and keep me going with their music and words. It was an amazing speech by the leader of the group. I love them so much.
Are they also the first Korean artist ever to give a speech at the UN General Assembly? Still trying to search...

For a 24 yrs old RM produced and composed a lot of @BTS_twt music plus a speech @UN Wow!!
Guys, I talked about bts going to the UN, and their speech and everything. I made my dad watch joon's speech, He looked VERY impressed Out of nowhere he said "yeah,yeah, I've read they're like nice, humble guys". I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE READ SOMETHING LIKE THIS
i told my mom that bts held a speech at the UN and she seemed really impressed and asked if they talked about an important topic lmao
I love how it’s been over a whole 24hrs & we’re still going on about the UN speech. What are gonna be like after this? Amazing.. so happy BTS are getting to spread their music cause honestly, I’m always hoping someone else finds them & is able to heal from them like I am https://twitter.com/GMA/status/1044602426257547265 …

Is there any real need to refer to them as a K-Pop group? When was the last time you saw a Western artist invited to the UN to deliver a speech like that. They are a group from South Korea but what they're doing for the UN goes far beyond a music genre. #BTS #UNGA
It’s what I feel everyday after everything they do. Case in point, yesterday, I was non-functional after Namjoon’s @BTS_twt speech at the UN. I had to rewatch that bazzilion times before I was able to escape and get back to my to do list! WTF! Let me live!!!
idc what your opinions are on kpop and idc what your opinions are on bts, but yalls better listen to kim namjoons speech at the un meeting and accept him for the KING he is
If you’ve just discovered @BTS_twt because of their speech at the UN, I’m happy to inform that the entirety of their discography circles around the themes and messages presented! Happy listening :)

Ok... what did it change? How did the economy change? What impact did it have on humanitarian grounds? The problem with modern day civilization is that we're easily distracted by dumb things to get us to shut up such as a boy band making a speech at a UN meeting or a baby.
@bts_bighit R.M. Your United Nations speech was eloquent. The UN members have frantic schedules and so much on their minds; and your speech gave them a chance to slow down. It gave them a chance to just sit and listen. That is a remarkable feat. I applaud you and wish you well.

Hi @KissFMUK I’ve just watched the leader of @BTS_twt BTS giving a terrific speech at the UN ceremony yesterday. I was wondering if you would love to play ‘IDOL’ by BTS ft. Nicki Minaj? Loads of people would love that. Lots of love x
I know all members of BTS are stunningly beautiful, but focusing on how they looked during the UN speech detracts from their message. I find it a bit frustrating. *sigh*
I was inspired by namjoon speech at the UN GA yesterday, so I'm reading a book called "courage compassion and connection: the gifts of imperfection" & this quote really touched me.

What the fuvk my sister who doesn't even know what kpop is just congratulated me on Bts's UN speech WOW
They can be part, but what i said is they aren't specifically needed to be addressed. That's your opinion, but the fact that you were disappointed by his speech not addressing K-pop, i'm pointing out that you missed the goal of the UN and BTS' reason why they were told to speak.
this is what my skeptical uncle had to say after he saw Namjoon's speech in the UN. OMG This is how powerful yesterday's speech was. Truly groundbreaking. I've always talked to him about BTS, their message & how much they mean to me. #BTSxUnitedNations @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/NeblWv0EMS

she left her boyfriend just because he wanted to do more volunteering works upon hearing kim namjoon's UN speech. I should know when she asked me about bts when she was a xenophobic ass before
imagine y’all president and BTS both addressing the UN and Namjoon, who’s second language is NOT English, has his speech taken more seriously than the president of the country where the UN is located Laughable. https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1044597810501505026 …
Listen Bts didn’t go to the UN meeting for y’all to be talkin shit about other groups like this. Namjoon had a whole ass speech on saying he was just a boy with a dream to help people. You don’t think that’s what all these other groups are doing too?
Quite disgusted with the comment section of @CNN ‘s Instagram post about #RM ‘s UN speech. People need to learn how to look beyond the fact that that guys are wearing makeup.

Alright so. Aside from the fact that his speech to the UN was powerful and beautiful and inspiring...who else would die if they heard Namjoon reading an audiobook or even just a book he loves? The emotion he could put into it? The beauty of his speaking voice? (+) @BTS_twt
@BTS_twt RM's speech at the UN assembly was beautiful. Is so inspiring to see someone use their talent to help the world. Great job BTS!!!.

- and then I came across Namjoon`s speech at UN. Let me tell you the truth. I forgot about EVERYTHING. His words saved me, okay? And, I have gained this certain confidence in me that yes, this is me and I should not belittle myself. @BTS_twt became my constant. My saviour.
From "oh god, you like them" to "I'm so proud of u my daughter, you stan kind and humble men". Wow my mom rlly supports me in lovin bts because joon's speech at UN. she's actually an army now and currently watching bts crackvids:') <3 @BTS_twt
If my mom, cousins, siblings, non-kpop friends, relatives, or even our neighbors will ask me why I love BTS so much, rather than saying anything, I would tell them to watch BTS speech in UN, in that way they will understand me.. :)
Funny that the next speaker wasn’t paying attention to what #BTS said in their UN speech, isn’t it. The stereotype that @bts_bighit @BTS_twt fans are “girls crying” coming from a woman herself was disappointing. Some of us older fans don’t appreciate the indirect diss. @BigHitEnt
I haven't really had the time to tweet about the un speech because I've been at work all day but let me just say I'm so so proud of bts and how far they've come. they wanted to represent and inspire youth and now they're doing just that
Why it didnt sit well with some? What she said was true tho? Iam crying because im was moved by his speech. Some of us are. So we are PERFECTLY FINE with what she said. But some people make it like 'the girls was crying' bcos of the SOLE reason that bts is at the un. +
I have to say, I've watched @BTS_twt's speech at least 4 times and I've cried twice. So thank you @BTS_twt for actually making me watch the UN speeches and enjoying them. I also thank @IISuperwomanII because she too was inspirational.
Rm’s speech on behalf of BTS at the UN.

I just listened to BTS' UN speech and... I don't often cry, I usually only succumb to tears in these kinds of emotional things when I myself am in a very horrible place but.. It brought me to the brink of tears. They didn't have to mention us... it's all them but...
I bet after that UN speech there will be an influx of Armys buying stars and naming it to RM and BTS. So much so they'll make them their own constellation.
Omo after their speech in UN,they have to attend @jimmyfallon. I'm sure they are tired but they choose to perform.They don't have enough complete rest but here they are again. I'm very proud of you my boys! You really deserve the whole love in this world or I should say universe
Bts slowly pulling me into their fandom. My gosh. Namjoon’s UN speech was just too good.
Truly, what a relief that I found them when I needed them the most. When I told my mom about BTS giving speech at the UN, she said "you have chosen golden people in your life". I felt so happy and proud. P.s. my mom loves BTS because they have made a positive impact in my life.
@TheJose8A i teared up watching your reaction to BTS speech at the UN general assembly..
I was a ball of emotions after yesterday’s @UN speech and all I could think of was “Wow, this is probably what it feels like watching your kid give the valedictorian speech at his graduation except it’s WORLD WIDE AND TELEVISED” so proud of @BTS_twt @bts_bighit #GenUnlimited
Namjoon’s speech in UN Assembly transcends generation, age, gender, race, and status. It is so powerful and meaningful that it touched a lot of people, even those who don’t know him and BTS. #BTSxUnitedNation

the only special for this day was @BTS_twt speech at UN happened and im so proud of them. really, proud is understatement, there are no exact words that can define how proud i feel for stanning bangtan that's why i vote for #BTS for #TheGroup of 2018 at #PCAs
csnt stop thinking abt bts @that un con n joons speech... i love them
She, during her speech at the UN told that "millions of fangirls are crying because of you"(referring to BTS) which I feel was taken out of context..It was wrong choice of words on her part ..
Come for BTS if: • You scored 2 #1 on BB200 • You scored higher than #10 in Hot100 • You made a comeback on BBMAs • You got INVITED to The Grammy Museum • You won a KMA Daesang for Musician of the Year • You were invited to deliver a speech in UN General Assembly
Ask them about their speech at the UN and talk about their love myself campaign pls
i'm soo proud for them, my life is not just what I dream it, but @BTS_twt and they speech makes my spirit booster to my continue my life with more smile. #Youth2030 #BTSxUnitedNations

It never felt more right to stay by your side as an ARMY. Thank you for giving us your voice to reach the world. #BTSxUnitedNationspic.twitter.com/PEreyzQ1mJ

I'll be talking about BTS' amazing week, the impact of the UN speech, and answering one question in particular about BTS and the K-pop stereotype that A LOT of people kept asking. (like every other person. LOL) It's not too late to submit a question! DM me over @odiegotablog!
Guys so since I’m learning how to play “I’m Fine” on the keyboard and I sent it to my friend and she loved it and she asked what song it was and who’s it is. I asked her to listen to their UN speech and she said yes. She doesn’t like bts at all so I am so surpirsed and excited
During the UN live some nojams were really constantly asking for BTS during a speech about how the colour of your skin doesn’t matter and how you’re always treated as an equal. Like I get that you wanna see them, but atleast have some respect for other speakers
Why can’t it just be BTS male historic speech at UN for youth2030 campaign that’s it it’s that simple
I’ve been so busy I was only just now able to watch @BTS_twt’s RM’s speech at the @UN. It made me tear up. It had so much meaning to me. Thank you.
I also got her to watch Namjoon UN speech and she thought it was great
I still can’t believe BTS was at the UN! And RM’s speech was so heartfelt and touching~ https://twitter.com/jungxhodu/status/1044378485374910464 …
My mom really listening my story about @BTS_twt speech in UN hahaha. She really applause them, she know how i'm so proud about them. She said 'whats next? I thought you will be more motivated now. I hope you can live your life with more confindent now' i hope that too.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/o6djPLbKaFI?a BTS RM's UN Speech Reaction
24 yrs old Kim Namjoon delivered a speech about Self Love at UN. I'm impressed dude! and thb I learned to love myself because of BTS. I love me, my flair and my flaws. <3
Polished speech by @BTS_twt at @UN. I actually liked it. But let's not pretend the images of many K-Pop stars aren't heavily sanitised for marketing purposes and videos. Loads of pressure on young people about image and being themselves. So what are the messages sent? #UNGA
Like you, I am proud of the great sons of South Korea. #BTS made history! With great dignity, the boys gave a speech at the UN, with a message for the youth of the whole world! The First Lady of South Korea, so sweet. In her face I see the proud mother of the nation. @BTS_twt
2018/09/24 BTS speech - UN General Assembly. @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations BTS Leader Kim Nam Joon:- My name is Kim Nam Joon also known as RM the leader of the group BTS. It is a incredible honour to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today's young generation. pic.twitter.com/5ttPR8u3J3
*after the UN speech* Armys: *crying, talking about how far BTS has come and how@amazing joon is* Me: *zoomed in picture of joon’s face* lol his chin is sticking out so much, looks like an egg
Tips on dealing w ppl that talk trash/ques your love and support towards bts: 1. Don't get angry or offended 2. Let them watch bts' speech at the UN General Aasembly 3. Watch them slowly digest and get struck by enlightenment 4. Smile and say have a nice day #BTSxUnitedNations
At breakfast kanina, we talked about today's generation speaking up on topics such as mental illness following the BTS' UN speech. Then during dinner time, we talked about Philippine politics following Trillanes' arrest. Never thought my family and I would get to talk like this.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/tBmJaTI24TA?a BTS RM Namjoon trembled his hands during his speech at UN. So heart touching.
tbh i’m not a fan of BTS and i don’t know much abt them. i don’t know how many members are there, not knowing them personally nor their songs. but seeing them giving their adorable speech at UN just make me so proud as an asian
A band called attention yesterday at the UN General Assembly - The KPOP BTS group, which is a sensation in South Korea, spoke only 3 minutes but the speech in favor of young people has already viralized on the internet.

- so Namjoon's words, once again, touched my soul. Hey Namjoon. I'm on my way to work now. I'm getting out of my house and working hard. Meanwhile you're standing there giving a speech about your story at the UN. We really came a long way huh? @BTS_twt #RM
You thought Im done talking about BTS x UN? Nah! If the boys could group hug yesterday after Joon did the speech, I swear they would’ve done it.
Am I the only one who sees BTS as more than artists/idols after Namjoon's speech at UN? I feel like I love them one step deeper than before. Seriously, they made me realised how important self love is. I'm not even aware about it myself. #MPN2018 #BTSARMY #BTS @BTS_twt
It’s my first time to listen to UN’s speech, because of you, @BTS_twt When 남준 talk about he own story, I can’t help but cry. I can feel his heart.

I may be annoying by rting every tweet about Namjoon's speech and Bts apperience at the UN but im not sorry. Im PROUD of them and of how they use their voices. Also i think that everybody should listen to Namjoon's speech because (not being biased) but that speech was amazing.
I give all my respects to BTS!! It is such an honor to give a speech at UN!
ok I need to see the speech of bts at the un but all the pics and videos I’ve seen kinda fuck me up bc it’s so much like the model un I was part of here and that was the highlight of my time at school and it just looks so cool
During Namjoons speech at #UN I couldn't help but to imagine BTS next album concept: "SPEAK YOURSELF" #BTSxUnitedNations #BTS

Today was incredible. I turn on my tv and every news channel in my country report about Kim Namjoon’s speech at the UN general assembly. This is insane. Their impact. Proud cant be enough to describe my feeling. I STAND THE RIGHT GROUP @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations #GenUnlimited

I'm proud of BTS speech in the UN. I felt motivated more just now.
I am so proud of BTS-my babies out there delivering a speech at the UN . Now this is what I call a group that inspires @BTS_twt

I've been so proud for all of today. People in my life that don't know a thing about kpop were talking about @BTS_twt UN speech. I know that I'll love them in some way for the rest of my life
Good morning! @BTS_twt are Goodwill Ambassadors for #GenUnlimited & were invited to the UN, where Namjoon gave a beautifully inspiring speech, met with the First Lady & received watches from the Blue House. They will be on Fallon tonight & GMA tomorrow. Life is good for BTSxARMY.
#Vh1Teensday .....please play ... #IDOL by @BTS_twt .....well..... @Vh1India ....I am curious to know do you listen to BTS'S ...speech at UN .yesterday.....not telling in the way cause I am AN ARMY ..THEIR FAN ...but it's worth to every youth...and every people
Honestly I'm Disgusted imagine talking about BTS speech at UN which is about encouraging youths to speak themselves and at the same time doing a useless poll about who is the best kpop group this is unprofessional in so many level pic.twitter.com/ECCo1jpKfG
They're invited to a meeting-like event UN held in UNGA(idk how this happened) with the topic of "Youth 2030" and had a 3 min speech there check out the speech it was so powerful and emotional
I made my parents watch Idol and Namjoon's speech on UN and they said, Parents: "When will be this boys come here?" "How much are the tickets for the concert" "Ooh, who's that man who spoke?" OMG! I think my parents will be ARMYs too #BTS #BTSxUnitedNations @BTS_twt
I still can't get over with the speech Kim Namjun/ Kim Namjoon/ RM/ 김남준 said at the UN meet. been watching it again and again.. been reading it again and again.. Hearing it again and again. It truly was inspiring. @BTS_twt #BTS
Sent my friends the link for BTS' UN speech.. asked them to listen to it.. It won't hurt trying spreading RM's words..
A girl in my linguistics class today saw my phone background of Jimin and RM and she questioned if they were BTS and I replied yes, then she said “they were at the UN, why the fuck were they there so confused” I then asked her if she heard the speech and she said only +
I was so inspired by Namjoon's UN speech that I tweeted a part of his words into the school twt account (part of my work is handling social media). No one batted an eye and it garnered quite an impression. I am so happy I got some students feel empowered today. @BTS_twt
The fact people still refuse to take BTS seriously, when the UN! The United Nations! gave them a chance to make a speech baffles me. If one of the most influential organisations trust BTS views & thoughts, the fact some of the GP can’t because they’re a korean group Disgusts me.
no words can explain how proud i am of you guys and how happy i am that i'm part of this lovely fandom. thank you for your inspiring speech
I don't think I realized how huge it is that BTS just gave a speech at UN i am still processing
It wasn't RM who gave a speech at the UN. It was Kim Namjoon. A 24 year-old man, who dreamt of being a superhero when he was a child, a humble person who is currently living his dream of being one of the voices for the youth, was the one who gave that wonderful speech. @BTS_twt
I'm so so proud of you guys! Thankyou so much! The speech was amazing. Each & every single word. You did an amazing job Namjoon!
https://youtu.be/xjzPhmMzVYA @BTS_twt BTS, congratulations for your great speech at UN. BTS, although I'm not your fan, but you amazed me. You encouraged many youngsters to love themselves and be hardworking. Hope you boys take care of your health
im like highkey crying rn i just saw bts speech at the un im so proud of them :((
Watched @BTS_twt Namjoonie’s speech again in UN... and it still makes me cry :(
RM's speech at the UN is really uplifting and inspirational. I can really relate to him as I have made mistakes in my life, yet I am willing to learn from my mistakes. By the way, his English voice is very handsome for someone who is self-taught. Respect! #BTS #RM

Thank you so much for giving the world such an inspiring and moving message. I am beyond proud I woke up watching your speech, Namjoon and I couldn’t help but cry, thank you boys for being a voice to this generation! I love you with all my heart
Saya suka video @YouTube http://youtu.be/o6djPLbKaFI?a BTS RM's UN Speech Reaction
I just realised that Namjoon's UN speech mirrored the messages in Answer: Love Myself I guess he didn't have to write a speech just for the occasion, he just had to repeat the same message that @BTS_twt have consistently shared through their music #BTS #TheGroup #PCAspic.twitter.com/Lr0VODA0Co
Ironic how the comments are saying “you’re a bully” for not liking the music, you’re “always in their business” blah blah but these probably the same ones who helped slander Namjoon’s entire UN speech just bc it was BTS and didn’t listen to the important message
Im so fucking pissed my uncle came to my house and asked about bts’ speech at UN i thought he was serious as he was asking me the deeper meaning behind joon’s words

I forced my mum to watch @BTS_twt Kim Namjoon UN speech and once it start she was focusing so hard and she told me "he will do something great in the future" and I was like he is already doing it but Yeah Kim Namjoon is great role model and hero for people like me.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/xjzPhmMzVYA?a FULL SPEECH: @BTS_twt speaks at the 73rd @UN General Assembly in NYC
Bts speech in un is the good path to make general public understand how smart and intelligent bts are i mean not all of them like to hear music so that was a really good opportunity
i'm so sorry my bts sweeties, people are so mad seeing you give a wonderful speech at the UN Assembly. don't worry, you did pretty good a while ago. they must have been jealous because it wasn't their faves. sighs.
Ok ok So.. yesterday was hamilton concert, last night UN speech Tonight BonVoyage eps 2?, Ugh... @BTS_twt king of providing content
unpopular opinion: BTS in UN (good job, btw) sounds like they're in a funeralllll anddd sounds like me trying to do my advocacy speech last year XD
the way the k-antis are dragging bts for their speech at the UN and seeing karmy have to defend them is unpleasant and sad

BTS at UN giving a speech I’ll never shut up about it
*humming to any @BTS_twt's song* "are u a fan of bts?" *nods* "theyre reallly great. u r lucky that u r one of those people who's loving them. btw, they really inspired me to love myself ever since i heard their speech in UN" if i will ever encounter this, i'll sob & hug them
I just watched bts speech on UN with namjoon as the speaker and I feel so so so proud of them, they really out here making changes and be an icon and also a legend, they're the first kpop group to ever has a speech at the UN @BTS_twt you guys did it
You know why Namjoon's speech touched so many Army? Cuz BTS has been talking about these topics since their debut. It wasn't a "put on show" just for the UN speech. Once again showing everyone one of BTS core strengths: SINCERITY.

I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/tBmJaTI24TA?a BTS RM Namjoon trembled his hands during his speech at UN. So heart touching.
i’ve been so busy thinking about bts and namjoon’s speech at UN that i totally forgot bv3 ep2 comes out today
aaand my song (feat. an audio clip from @BTS_twt's UN speech) is up on soundcloud. it'll be available shortly on itunes and spotify, but until then, stream it for free! https://soundcloud.com/aryamachdi/self
Watch me in few months from now listening to Skit: UN Conference Speech in BTS new album Speak Yourself pic.twitter.com/AvSHjGO4Mz
He's fluent in English, but it's a language he taught himself as a teenager. He wrote the speech so eloquently, and then spoke his words in front of the UN, his colleagues at UNICEF, his members, and the world. I can barely put my hand up in class and ask a question. My god.
i was once dreaming on having a job at UN after i met those wonderful people at the national/international meeting of cimsa. today that dream are getting bigger after i watched bts' speech for UNICEF. i hope years from now i'll look back at this tweet nd say 'i am here at the UN'
I'm so proud of you boys. Keep it up. Saranghaeyo. I'm so touch of the speech that Namjoon spoke awhile ago
RM's speech at UN was beautiful. They proved that they did more than making history. They're being an inspiration to millions of ppl around the world. And despite all of this they remain selfless with their talents and humble in their work and achievements. @BTS_twt
video @bts_twt speech di UN entah udah berapa puluh kali kutonton, namjoon did so well, he was so amazing, his speech was truly perfect, why is he so gooooooood in words? i can’t even imagine how hard it would be to prepare a 6 minute long speech.. i love him so much
I'm so proud of you! It was a powerful speech!! #namjoonisgladhechangedhisnametoRM #imKimNamjoonandRapMonster
so i have assignment to remake 5 articles to make it look better and bet my ass will use articles about bts giving speech on UN conference
basically the Blue house (kr. white house) told ARMYs to go on their fb page to watch the UN speech While another fandom was spamming the Blue house with a petition to sue MAMA (award show) bc their faves didn't receive the award but BTS did
IM SO PROUD OF YOU LOVES OMG IM SORRY IM BUSY WITH WORK BUT IM DOING THIS SO THAT I CAN ATTEND YOUR CONCERT NEXT YEAR. IM CRYING WHILE WATCHING NAMJOON'S SPEECH I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY IM SO PROUDDDDD ALL I CAN DO IS CRY GOD I LOVE YOUUU IM PROUD TO BE ARMY

Sept 24, 2018 is that legendary day when Namjoon "RM", in behalf of @BTS_twt , delivered an inspirational speech at the UN GA in front of the whole world. Mark your calendars. We will celebrate this historical moment every year #BTSxUnitedNations

Namjoon’s UN speech is so beautiful, I can’t stop listening to it since this morning. It’s very soothing, his beautiful words with his deep voice, it calms my soul. it’s like my new lullaby now. @BTS_twt

I just watched the UN speech and I just wanted to say that I'm really thankful that they can help people who don't love themselves and give people more self-confidence. Namjoon and @BTS_twt you did a great job, you nice keep going. Love yourself and speak for yourself
Namjoons UN speech that's it that's the tweet @BTS_twt
I asked my ARMYs from class if they already heard @BTS_twt speech in #UNGA but they were like “what speech? UN? huh?” and suddenly ,,, i dont know them anymore. they found the door and stepped out ....
One of the best headlines covering BTS' UN speech so far. Thank you @BBCR1 for not seeing the necessity to define their achievements in relation to an entire music industry. It's as simple as 'Kim Namjoon of @BTS_twt'
BTS ki UN speech could be one of the reasons
am i still crying over namjoon's UN speech? best believe i am, you make me so proud @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …

Namjoon's UN speech really touched my heart and I'm very much sure it did touched everyone else's too. That speech was so powerful. While I was listening, I realized many things, specially about LOVING MYSELF and SPEAKING MY NAME WITH MY OWN VOICE. @BTS_twt #BTSxUnitedNations
hey guys, have u already watched bts' speech in UN earlier? pls watch it again thnx
Sorry but I was not joking about suicide. Anyway, I don’t really get your main point. I know our fandom has toxic people and some shame other army for being less devoted (every fandom has toxic and people..still I am ARMY).But I don’t understand this connection with BTS UN speech
my tweet was on 10th November and i had no idea that they were going to participate in the UN speech @BTS_twt https://twitter.com/19940912KOYA/status/1044531865107947520 …
THIS is perhaps one of the best headlines I've seen covering @BTS_twt's UN speech so far. No 'first K-pop act' or 'Korean boyband'. They said it exactly as he did - 'Kim Namjoon of BTS' https://twitter.com/BBCR1/status/1044522807156232192 …

bts' UN speech is so inspiring the sincerity and love i felt in that speech is indescribable im so thankful for their existence.
Was UN a comedy event ? This ain't it. Also there is a thing called constructive criticism so. If you are so bothered by someone anonymous tweet @her. Imagine how armies felt labelled as crying fangirls in front of the whole UN session mins after RM's wonderful speech.
I dont trust “ARMYs” who didnt listen to @BTS_twt speech during the #UNGA / know that they had a speech in the UN
I'm so proud of my boys and their speech of acceptance and affirmation! #BTS is the first South Korean Boy band to speak at the UN General Assembly. Go go go boys and conquer the world!!! #BTS #Forever #FanGirlMomenthttps://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1044357197600305156 …
yes its our president, the first kpop leader who delivered a wonderful speech at UN @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/KN5UoZ6P1Z
Bts didn't go to UN and give an inspirational speech just for y'all to learn nothing from it. i just know y'all would be so much more powerful considering your size if u were respectful and peaceful instead of bashing other fandoms. this goes to all the kpop community too.
sooo my i told my mom about bts in un summit and the conclusion that she makes are: the speech was impressive and namjoon has a really nice voice... yes pic.twitter.com/CkEDmAK7eY
My parents are on a vacation abroad right now and I sent them BTS's UN speech and my mom told me she saw already bc @BTS_twt was on the news in the country where they were staying
AMAZING SPEECH
[ENG] BTS SPEECH at UNICEF: “Youth 2030: The UN Youth Strategy” https://youtu.be/7kJpilfmcak @YouTubeより
I'm so moved by your speech @RM. I'm so proud of you @BTS_twt
just watched namjoon's speech at @UN. i got emotional seriously hes the one who needs the young people all over the world today. hes the voice of the youth w/ every word he throw is very true he spreaks so profoundly and sincere. @BTS_twt #UNGA #Youth2030 #BTSXUN #GenUnlimited
One word how u felt after seeing the speech at the UN? @BTS_twt
So, after listening to it today like I’ve been doing so at least once a day, I decided to check it out. And what I found out was AMAZING. So RM spoke at the UN conference yesterday, and it turns out that RM’s speech at the UN conference were filled with pieces of that song! #BTS
at my parents' place in ilsan for chuseok. my mother watched the entire un speech (unprompted by me) and was so proud rm was born here and mentioned the city in his speech. she even calls him namjoonie now. @BTS_twt
pending: bangtan bomb special ep. BTS SPEECH AT UN IN NY.
why yall even talking abt other groups activities? Btches bts has just done a speech in the UN assembly, we have no time for this. Go stream the queen ly answer and wait for bon voyage 2. This week there's still GMA and Fallon + ly tour concerts. BTS needs our full support
Wow, First Lady gave BTS a custom made Blue House watch & its gifted to limited people, a FB page with over 20M followers posted BTS's UN speech, UN's secretary general said it's far too rare for young people to watch UN's assembly, BTS are truly the global leader & Korea's pride
Once again i’ll probably never get tired to say how proud i’m of you, boys. As artists, as humans, you’re the inspiration for billions of people around the world. I hope the special speech that Namjoon delivered, will make an impact on many people’s hearts! #BTSxUnitedNationspic.twitter.com/RJWxNgzFa0
Imagine how did Namjoon made his speech for UN while busy preparing for their concerts and other stuffs to do. They're too busy but he still managed to speak his thoughts and share it to the million people who's watching them. I'm so proud of them. @BTS_twt
OMYGOD BTS AT THE UN IS SUCH A REALLY PROUD MOMENT AND THE WAY KIM NAMJOON DELIVERED HIS SPEECH IN FRONT OF HIGHLY RESPECTED WORLD LEADERS AMAZES ME NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS NOT SPEAKING IN HIS FIRST LANGUAGE
